Jennifer An@@ iston : I always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston does not always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made clear to the Hollywood star in an interview .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or put up from the outside label , which usually do little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; honestly , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
&quot; Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that she is considered &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; dearest to the act@@ ress , namely their time at home , pre @-@ placed TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and mex@@ ican food , it says in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; to the white color they bring the question of the child &apos;s desire : &quot; &quot; we women do not have to be married or have children to be totally &quot; , &quot; so the Hollywood star . &quot;

gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger sought a little variation with a couple of colleagues with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled on her celebr@@ ity , she said in the fast g@@ allo@@ p at home to the feed @-@ animals . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and thus the riding career ended then again .
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer at all times - 101 tournament @-@ desc@@ ents - again close to horses .
&quot; he allowed himself to lead his family over the plant of AL@@ RV on a horse , he didn &apos;t even try to use a photo for himself . &quot;
the first time in Aachen and thus also with CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
German Spor@@ thilfe handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala .
&quot; hon@@ ours , it lacks the sympathetic athletes . &quot;
&quot; cross@@ roads , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already led him .
longer is the 18th pri@@ ze@@ winner of the sports pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first pri@@ ze@@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler .
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger supports the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 Euro . &quot;
&quot; with 15 more outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the car@@ er Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ven Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the fe@@ eder Eber@@ hard Gi@@ anna , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Ru@@ dr@@ ka Frank Wi@@ ene@@ ke , the jumping Al@@ win Sho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um of the hand of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative company migr@@ ates into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize ran . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ &apos;s and Tr@@ umps Policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential elections are however in case of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , more philosophical difference . &quot;
the state about the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubt smaller in doubt and warns that how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
Clinton wants to assert the economy to death and adjust to death he says .
&quot; on the other hand , he himself would be quite different , claims Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw the regulations , and he makes for a wide @-@ ranging tax reform with lower tax sets strongly - for private individuals and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain duties to fulfil , he has disadvantaged odds and needs to make money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes for the rich would increase , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the need , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say close . &quot;
democratic Candi@@ date announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the stat@@ eless Te@@ apart@@ y @-@ wing of the Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; in Tr@@ ump , there are still party internal discussions . &quot;
significant are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal fired power stations and drive the coal mining in the US again .
oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and asks : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
but not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements both competitors are not too far away from each other .
&quot; PP , the transp@@ azi@@ fic trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the US would not want to isolate the US from international trade but simply protect American jobs . &quot;
they should then be paid even better then calls for about Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger wage .
it wants to raise it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to r@@ enter , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the large discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand Tr@@ ump is Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him before , that the budget deficit would be just bigger . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , wants to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any mis@@ guided woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is one of women who fled alone , almost certainly in everyday life . &quot;
if they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
each has a baby who is at the most one year old .
one has laid their little son in my arms .
he looks curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother goes straight to the tab@@ le@@ top .
until she notes that she is observed .
it sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the theme of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are afraid .
they live in Munich in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for omni@@ v@@ aded women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and Munich &apos;s Women &apos;s Aid .
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
&quot; men , there is no - also not as a visitor . &quot;
the exception is a guard in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : any woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as a hop@@ eless@@ ness to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , there are many reasons for the run : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , compul@@ sion , honorary mor@@ bid , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end is , once they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
&quot; in this case , women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferi@@ or and worse . &quot;
&quot; this led to some 90 percent of women who live in the housing in Munich &apos;s north , traumati@@ zed it . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
many women are so accustomed to say that they don &apos;t say anything .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experienced , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often do not cure themselves , more accommodations are needed only for them . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven District governments are responsible for the housing of refugees .
&quot; on the question , whether they knew of a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken there is such a thing in the housing of the governments .
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women are not housed alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ person of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Mittel@@ baden , there are some common shel@@ ters or separate houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee &quot; Rights of Women and Gender Equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the Committee , it says , &quot; It is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lacking privacy , or are being housed in both men and women , it may be - continual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel in need of this protection , it is possible to read the urge to go to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around , we have a long queu@@ es , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second home .
general strikes : demands for new work @-@ work measures
&quot; the dep@@ u@@ ties have called on their union to promote new work @-@ based measures , in case of a new contract . &quot;
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has requested all the advice , starting from early September more work @-@ based measures . &quot;
&quot; J@@ DC said , &quot; &quot; the J@@ DC said that it would have failed to address the concerns about the contract . &quot;
&quot; in July , assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract , which has been agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was released on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government &quot; pers@@ isted silent &quot; had been on issues that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board , voted to fully dis@@ lean the proposed new treaty and calls for official new negotiations with all claims . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board has put forward a formal application to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to escal@@ ate an ongoing programme with escal@@ ating working @-@ measures that begin in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes conducted that assists in the year sixty , the first total failures in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
the BM@@ A Ass@@ ass@@ ologists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote through 5@@ 4.000 assistance and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the Lisbon Treaty would be introduced in England . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ sides &quot; ?
&quot; it was a gesture , which ended a crisis . &quot;
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , in order to give their hands and to preach an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I cannot rep@@ el the expression that Ankara wants to achieve this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s gr@@ asp@@ ed sli@@ pp@@ le , and he radi@@ ated hardly any heat , even for his cautious conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , however , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even further improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have heard , as if never something happened . &quot;
for me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the contrary .
&quot; but one of Putin radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first to say what he mentioned in his administration : the de@@ preci@@ ation of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was w@@ ut@@ ent@@ bran@@ ched .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back .
the trial was even bigger than it was committed by a alleged friend .
building up again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media conducted a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything .
&quot; most of the most serious officers were the accus@@ ations from leaders that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trading in Syria would have been controlled by the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Islamic state &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received Erdo@@ gan from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after the last month at a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat almost from his reign .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
Russian sanctions hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year .
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they are counting on a late seasonal attack at the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television sets cheaper than fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish ag@@ ri @-@ imported goods are allowed to be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ z@@ sti portra@@ yed it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists staying there , tomatoes there long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West , because it &apos;s a reaction to the tried @-@ to @-@ see power as a weak answer . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the persistent Gro@@ ll about the snow@@ y of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the op@@ pi@@ ke is to pull off the cool spirit and reduce the relation to Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that he requested support for the elected government institutions after the attempted coup . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ noticed for Moscow , which itself has a profound fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea makes it possible to present Russia and Turkey , as a analy@@ st once described me , &quot; &quot; alliance of external side &quot; &quot; : two countries that are ch@@ ased and badly affected by the West and now ign@@ ite themselves . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial discussions both presidents at the press conference , they said that they had not even stri@@ ped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey de@@ aler@@ ed it on a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found to Syria .
&quot; but after months of open en@@ m@@ ity of hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect dis@@ cord , as NATO member of Turkey the Russian martial jet , it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talk to each other . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available to Scotland outside of Scotland
&quot; according to the CEO of the Bank , R@@ BS will be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the CEO of the Bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with the fact that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has always dist@@ ancing itself since they had almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago .
&quot; at this time , brand @-@ str@@ ate@@ gen &quot; R@@ BS &quot; has used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial brands . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship by the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by up to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to move more national brands into the focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised head@@ quarter and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are others , smaller brands for the private customer business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors mark as well as the brand , among which our staff will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue any global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these marks will be completely different in their own con@@ gregations for something completely different , and our employees will be able to work with the customers among these marks . &quot;
&quot; R@@ BS has already said that it will no longer continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing , and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sport sponsorship . &quot;
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of the Marche , because how do we concentrate ourselves in the inner ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the leader . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and had launched these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these brands again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori arrives at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction to its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ ink@@ le champagne with a double at New@@ market with a profit from it 3.@@ 000@@ th win
the jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori was on Friday its 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit at New@@ market .
&quot; he put on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ etr@@ ack with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italians is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reached a milestone in the Flach@@ rennen . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ nat@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who had won on G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; &quot; it is something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too . &quot;
&quot; I am very happy that it happened in New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a mund@@ ane Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ er on when he takes the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached a milestone in the barriers - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories at a record career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modernity and it &apos;s no surprise that he achieved this milestone just few before him .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that differs from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma enthusiastic fans since years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he would have gotten out 6,000 gains if he would not only ho@@ ckey on a weekend and Grand tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has ri@@ dden already nearly 30 years of winning a winner in Britain .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated a milestone with a typical fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount .
&quot; from Fl@@ ying finishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of British low@@ lands for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had gotten back difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to its stock . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori had once again said that he will continue with competitions until his at least 5@@ 0.@@ 7 years of age .
Russia Putin fir@@ ing Stab@@ ia Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released his Deputy Minister Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest Trust of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed commission@@ er for environmental and transport affairs .
in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin it is that Putin has arranged without giving reasons &quot; the dis@@ mis@@ sal Ivan@@ ov@@ s of his duties as chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration .
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who has been Ivan@@ ov &apos;s deputy since 2012 was declared its successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tallinn , he made his conclusion at the prestigious international Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website it is called ( in Russian ) , that it later was a log @-@ chief director and employee leaders of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think it is the main task of the government to support your activity as leaders of law and checks the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivan@@ ov asked that Ivan@@ ov has asked for his post and had advised V@@ ain@@ o as its successor .
convincing the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov has long been one of the closest conspir@@ ators of Vladimir Putin and works like it for the Soviet secret service to the K@@ GB .
&quot; as Chief Executive , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , broadcast on TV broad@@ cast@@ ed , both men claimed that the chief &apos;s chief claim their own desire . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are few of them - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; thus , here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ? &quot;
he currently knows no one .
&quot; however , the official statement - that a man who once claimed as a potential president , would once forward the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his comments to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turned out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin got into power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin had violated the Constitution .
&quot; but this post has been taken by another , near ally Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin has become prime minister before he was appointed president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he proposed producer
Gib@@ son participated in a physical confrontation on the set of series in Los Angeles last month .
&quot; ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios , which produce the series , announce their cancellation in a common opinion . &quot;

Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North Sea of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; cover blo@@ wer &quot; , &quot; which completion of completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the brid@@ ging section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete , as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rope . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Brown joined the construction site for Keit@@ h Brown , and was one of the first to went down from the land to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historical and symbolic moment in the construction of the Queens@@ ferry Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of a Engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity that require extremely accurate toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a fu@@ ong@@ ation for deck , meaning that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first deadline for each brid@@ ging project is a significant milestone . &quot;
in this fantastic project the sh@@ utter @-@ setting forward @-@ setting and low @-@ building represents .
&quot; after installing the last stre@@ t section and its connection with the Nord@@ tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ etres in the south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , since the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 meters long is , approx . 6,000 tons weighs and had to be drawn up from approximately 3 % to the top . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances that the team works , they were tiny - on each side , they bore only a few mil@@ lim@@ etres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have &quot; luck still to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; luck still alive , &quot; after they were thrown away from the fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station took place on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat revol@@ ved around and placed us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have cut the boat out of its range , until we were left to water , &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were res@@ cu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found on a bo@@ gged without life@@ jacket .
they all arrived on board the coastal land and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who were thrown into the water have luck un@@ har@@ med and being alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ oting had a p@@ im@@ pl@@ um , but these sol@@ ves were removed while the bo@@ ots of the bo@@ ots started by the person who controlled the boat . &quot;

who builds Braunschwei@@ g cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Green Group : investors should continue to be much stronger in the future .
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschwei@@ g will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments in the coming years ?
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; &quot; to the next install@@ ment . &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who is supposed to build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is lacking so far .
&quot; SPD Group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : who want to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be included in the inventory . &quot;
&quot; but the major dispute settlement in the town hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors in order to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to rely on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing program , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed nor should be financed . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so viol@@ a : &quot; &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left does not want to provide har@@ sh@@ elling for investors .
&quot; regardless , as Brat@@ man , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in government administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; yet the program is not complete , because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how is the loss of further around 1300 @-@ priced apartments , whose promotion will be exp@@ ired in the coming years ? &quot;
only by 2020 alone will be 500 apartments .
&quot; to prevent this , as planned policy spokes@@ person in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ running ties from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it needs to be thought to bring apartments back into the price of price . &quot;
this is possible in the Western city .
to one fell s@@ woo@@ p to solve the problem .
&quot; for in the Western city , for the end of the year , dates back to the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get there back in the price of affordable housing . &quot;
&quot; only : that do not want the owners , the housing companies do not . &quot;
&quot; after all , the number of social housing in the Western city increases again dras@@ tically by the purpose of so @-@ called &quot; inter@@ ming@@ ling . &quot; &quot;
there is no more to share a concentration of social weak in just a few districts .
the Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; presidents of the Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go by boat . &quot;
this focused on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise cannot yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time working on screens ; in the last decade of many compl@@ ained . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then video games and most recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app , based on the characters , which were first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later came out a drawing series , game cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of pop culture declined from the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that over@@ lap the server .
&quot; within a few days Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der , and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players come out with their smartphones to the outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons to follow @-@ up using a GPS once they have been found &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( over a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation , which played the game , when she was still younger , closed to the W@@ ahn and sprang out for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the U.S. the game has led to a considerable rise in steps , which lays the &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch who re@@ pro@@ secuted the Washington Post recently concluded that within two days of launch of the game , the number of watched people followed every day , 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health , people want to bring about &quot; 30 minutes &quot; to get &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; , &quot; because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to become ill to cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonderful of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun .
&quot; thus , three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even join the hunt even new friend@@ ships .
as always there is also mur@@ ky playing spo@@ ber that always have to complain about something .
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what is meant to be ?
it has a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps were able to trace our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and make use of time .
&quot; however , because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ism in the real world and be able to help many people in the hunt , active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is based on all that im@@ mu@@ n .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the floor .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ ress .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast ens@@ lav@@ ed Thursday to the multi @-@ battle title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes below the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team champi@@ ons in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze statue of Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; the American Simone bil@@ it@@ ates on the sul@@ be@@ -@@ beam of women in the Olympics at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; it is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American woman , which wins a multi @-@ battle title and altogether the fifth , while it solidi@@ fies its reputation to be the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
&quot; this success shows them in the same league as unique athletes , such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years its sport medals , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , which is a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympi@@ ad from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ ton told her that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast , which I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it expected them to be a final exam in Brazil , a competition which was not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas will be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace both after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ struggle for women in the Olympics of summer 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while she was in the farewell celebration of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi for his retirement signs . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es ins@@ isted , during her long trail to the top , never planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
a part of her ground exercises - that included their typical tum@@ bling passport - is matched to Latin American music that would fit home on the road outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
it is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school flight to the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has not lost a multi @-@ struggle competition , a seal , which will stop so long as it doesn &apos;t wish . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two rot@@ ations easily , dec@@ ep@@ ted the picture . &quot;
float @-@ beams and bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which Bil@@ es wins the world title - lau@@ ded .
she fet@@ ched again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the float @-@ beam and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aces her gentle as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ F@@ uner@@ al - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book , to reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago , when she fought the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old man @-@ capitalism had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; which is called by the Americans &quot; O@@ ma . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after their soil of soil , they cast out to the public Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared without doubt . &quot;
&quot; as far as it affects , the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims shot in mass mur@@ der@@ ers while playing in the car
&quot; according to police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 year old girl killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ fall of Phoenix , while they were talking in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12th while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight nuts from a hand@@ fire@@ arm , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , is in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared with that the thre@@ e@@ fold murder would not have been the result of a predat@@ ory of prey , as the att@@ acker did not participated the hand@@ bags , or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were owned by an adult . &quot;
the police @-@ pre@@ cher of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the gre@@ ß@@ erei led the investig@@ ator to become a closer look at whether it is associated with four previous attacks .
altogether predominantly in Hisp@@ anic dormit@@ ories were killed in nine attacks seven persons and two more injured .
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard of the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , early of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown ro@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their wounds and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not unusual for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was gone on an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ age sle@@ eves and secured a bul@@ let from the seat , as well as ball fragments from the engine space . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his Alter@@ ed has Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy did not know . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought I was doing this . &quot;
I do not make this .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has left on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund would never realize her under certain circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they suggest@@ ing him to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit down until his third age of life nor he can still not speak .
but he slowly is making progress .
he can run and cycle cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please look something ahead of me . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a typical language , says it . Ed@@ mund has invented several signs alone . &quot;
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or ci@@ ca@@ vi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts may vary heavily .
it is still too soon to say how it will affect life with the Zi@@ c@@ avi@@ rus In@@ infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked constantly , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and they still don &apos;t know .
&quot; for a long time , I didn &apos;t ask the prognosis for a long time , because I do not expect me to really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has caused a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that caused by the Zi@@ ch@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ anas to Saturday .
&quot; the weather permits allowed , that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches might fall to rain . &quot;
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ ama it was used on Friday , a Fl@@ ut@@ e@@ war@@ ter system , while it continues to rain in the area mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite , near Den@@ ham Springs , both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana are all likely to reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could be floo@@ ding many houses in the subur@@ b near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a flood @-@ off del@@ u@@ ge in Ascension is a danger , as these rivers will only slowly flow into the Lake Mau@@ r@@ ha@@ as . &quot;

&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water of Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , rose very much overnight . &quot;
he said that he would have warned him a further step@@ son who lives near .
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she lived in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a flood of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all disabled and he was the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ per had saved all three in a large military @-@ truck , and had brought them to the next fire @-@ guard in Glo@@ ster , where she was accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the floods began to spread quickly , as there was still serious rainf@@ alls and that the evac@@ uation instructions were taken into consideration . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer resi@@ ded near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning from 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;

in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a were closed almost two incub@@ ation roads due to the high @-@ water and sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to keep the water from their homes and shops .
&quot; the last big flood that we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in passenger , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys , that it continues to rain on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his details , a handful of houses on Thursday was supposed to have been in@@ und@@ ated , but on Friday they were not registered until now . &quot;

&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by bul@@ lets &quot; &quot; survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police share with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child is shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents were given that Brown had suffered several shots , including in the L@@ oss , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in the hospital at his transport . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was del@@ etes by balls , his grandmother Del@@ ors Mel@@ termin@@ z shared the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I simply cannot believe it .
the boy &apos;s state was regarded as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boys family shared the radio station that he is likely to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people shot at German@@ town .
likewise there were three men : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in a stable state .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who found itself in a critical state , reported the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether there were among one of the last men of the perpetrators .
&quot; investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia , that apparently , it seems to have come to a fire fire between several guns . &quot;
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ age for storm @-@ tubes , which were rep@@ lic@@ ated to various Stur@@ m@@ ics , paraly@@ sed the scene . &quot;

why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie
that is what I imagine among the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic spirit and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at the olymp@@ ic Olympi@@ ad since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three tur@@ ner@@ ers , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this squ@@ ad , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is ca@@ tho@@ lic , round , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has solidi@@ fies the black and h@@ isp@@ anic presence at the head of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one of the female Tur@@ ner@@ inside an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas had a surprising Olympi@@ as and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they were unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone became the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American woman won in an individual multi @-@ club event for women gold . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the top of this sport , but it does not see classes in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie hit all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympi@@ am@@ ann@@ ons will have only four tur@@ ers in the team . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks that gymn@@ ast is a expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily unite in private turn@@ around which can be maintained by parents who pay for training , furnishing , competition and hotel cost ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ers and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these sne@@ e@@ ets lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these associations , the Tur@@ ner will receive their overall training and that is a long @-@ term and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer by Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , Train@@ ers of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes , since they started getting started . &quot;
&quot; we have to get inspired to the con@@ gregations of countless , young girls , who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , making a high @-@ performance and easy accessibility . &quot;
I founded my turn@@ outs of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ key in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and Hisp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ key , offering the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; tower develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this squ@@ ad , who bring thousands of young girls to get interested in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation by &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ es of the olymp@@ ic team of gold and thanks , F@@ ass has motivated her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of getting healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assistance practitioners would like to organize further strikes , after they have rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts proposal . &quot;
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of a reform@@ ist contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.000 assistance practitioners who voted on a vote declined . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t had un@@ veiled our plans to introduce the treaty , and said that N@@ HS would be harmful in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and any further delay to the staff and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance managers should receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekly work in order to improve the maintenance of normal movements . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the Chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ mit@@ es proposed last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance practitioners have agreed to the proposed agreement in particular that it will heat the current staff crisis and to meet all doctors . &quot;
&quot; in just eight weeks that still remain until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time is running out . &quot;
efforts by BM@@ A to resolve conflicts in the government should take part in the government and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened after a promise that Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had made it last month , that his door was always free . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t has to act now to lift up the penetration and address the worries of the assistance .
&quot; if he should not do this , they have made it clear that they are ready to carry out more work @-@ oriented measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike in late April saw a delay of almost 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , since nur@@ ses and specialists have been involved to grant doctors on the strike @-@ post@@ ure covering . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by the adoption of the reform@@ ism of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants to make a better estimate for the 5@@ 4.000 assistant , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , asked for the assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; working out measures do not achieve anything but little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare patient , nursing and their families only worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we talked to the com@@ promised patient with the Ministry of Health and the Health Ministry , as well as other ministries positive to address the concerns regarding tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; the employers hoped that the continued positive commitment on other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender Department have been in terms of compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ per day can reduce the heart attack
&quot; thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug , after recommended by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time . &quot;
the internal medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for persons with a crus@@ ade .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke and another heart attack . &quot;
the Reg@@ ul@@ ators N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the Reg@@ ul@@ ators N@@ ICE of N@@ HS has been recommended for a period of four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 14@@ 0.000 people suffer from a heart attack every year , and a quarter of this suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty materials in the arteries .
&quot; when the sei@@ z@@ ag elu@@ des , there can cause a blood cell that causes blood flow to the heart and thus caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cell sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ ves the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk to another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca , is driven by the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood c@@ ots in@@ probable . &quot;
&quot; the draft &apos;s draft from N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ technical evaluation center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have considerable negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attack and stroke at people , who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are glad that we are able to bro@@ aden the available treatment options at thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
&quot; the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the landing stage recommends no treatment , which goes beyond this period . &quot;
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ alling is blo@@ om in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man last year on the attack of a government report on corruption from the office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ tor has led to that widespread bal@@ dness in Muslim communities will be kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored and revealed as a crus@@ hing government report today .
&quot; the former cabinet member , Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ esses the police , f@@ ables and Rath@@ ke to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; persu@@ asions &quot; &quot; regarding eth@@ ni@@ cious and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Gover@@ ment , who is now a antagon@@ ism , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motiv@@ ations would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set out precip@@ bands outside of electoral shut@@ ters to protect intimi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should lead a pass , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
at present a vot@@ er must call its name and address .
&quot; the report suggests not to enter the finger of a person if they give their vote , to prevent that someone chooses two times . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal documents and decisions by no official comp@@ iles or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against electoral fraud , but is also intended to protect the local government in front of the wider corrupt and financial culture , which is associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the Down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ toral Committee in eastern London .
last year a special court decided that the mayor was Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man to be ab@@ used to a L@@ itan@@ ei and illegal practices of his ministry .
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way , &quot; &quot; and that he would have brought his critics to the silence of racism and Islam@@ ist accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous duty of Muslims , to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , when one person chooses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that in the whole country there was evidence of fraud .
&quot; in particular he vo@@ iced particularly alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent fonts , when older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling of out to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; as proof was justified that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people to choose according to the will of elders , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ kers background . &quot;
there was concern that ... state institutions should not kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored such behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; persu@@ asions regarding the eth@@ ni@@ cal and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke about 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including prohibition that political activ@@ ist ch@@ op@@ tionally work to stop &quot; voting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is being considered by Ther@@ esa May , demands also harder registration checks to prevent the electoral constitu@@ encies to immigration and social @-@ tru@@ ing purposes is being used . &quot;
consider options before choosing to ask your ID .
&quot; not remot@@ ely ink using a person , as soon as she has given her voice to prevent that someone chooses two times . &quot;
systematic review on nationality of a person to perform to ensure that they are op@@ tionally eligible .
a three @-@ year limit on applications to an automatic set @-@ selection .
ban that political activ@@ ist complete set @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of local elections are processed .
the police force the authority to set up ground @-@ stations for electoral stations .
a legislative change that facilitates an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representation of 1983 ) .
photography offered in election @-@ gy@@ ms .
&quot; requirement that only English may be used in the election stations , except for Wales ) . &quot;
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure that the staff will rule out , that voters are going to go alone in the gear . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric falls across the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets does not show any pen@@ ny . &quot;
&quot; the Elec@@ toral College has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for the basis of a de@@ itan@@ ism of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , he was found guilty because of the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the un@@ effective &quot; abor@@ tion controls &quot; of the Rath@@ ke divisions .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the Con@@ scienti@@ ous obj@@ ector in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country is wearing a proud legacy as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ doubled in and other famous Double @-@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ant in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are this week about the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot out of edge and band who proved to be an impressive double occupancy in the heart of Cambridge .
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ ons is by far not the only one to offer gold fighters who has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not when you can give faith to the social media .
&quot; hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that are fli@@ pping at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ oni@@ ds that have more than just a certain similarity with Hol@@ ly@@ a &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; hunter and Wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates double , on the cycle track , many people on the internet went out , like a certain ar@@ cher of the Gem@@ ini of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher has got the ins@@ anity in social media and gave that he had already heard of his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not see a large similarity , with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a well@@ spring @-@ looking guy , so I do that well as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be part of the center : the emerging similarity between the British vast@@ ness Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ er Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its big , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh was compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years .
one course higher : this user is that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
another prolonged comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ h who has similar severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
the Russian silver medal t@@ amp@@ ant in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord while the American Nathan was elected by fans of an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter @-@ user was very happy about that others have liked the similarities .
theory is put into space : according to this user there is perhaps a reason for the similarity of the couple .
&quot; a Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ football @-@ star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons made Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is nearly identical to the L@@ act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal in Tur@@ ning Gab@@ by Douglas which has her own beautiful , broad smile that resembles that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

Canadian Sender C@@ BC had to apologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in &quot; like M@@ ief went &quot; and during the race as &quot; a pig died . &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought , that his microphone was off , when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ l@@ sch@@ ni@@ ckel staff@@ el . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald , who was caught up into the commentary box at the C@@ BS on board to give more &quot; &quot; color &quot; , &quot; you could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese has lost sight , baby . &quot;
&quot; excited to be upset , he went like M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming exercise 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower as Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which made it possible to abandon the Canadian gap to China . &quot;
viewers in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and speech
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; has said the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swimming has died in China &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on show .
Ai Yan@@ han from China was described at the final 4 x 200m
the criticism against B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came swift and hard with which many could talk to him
&quot; Twitter users did not get back , when they heard , how uns@@ ensi@@ tizing B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald was &quot;
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you just present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; shortly thereafter , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC programme , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment on a swimming power has been aired . &quot;
&quot; it was an unhappy chosen wording , it is sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC apologi@@ ze for over 90 times at the people who responded to the comments about Twitter
the comment@@ ator @-@ colleague Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter servers , who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network exc@@ used also quickly and gave a message out .
&quot; we regret that these statements were made , and that it was made possible that it will be broadcast . &quot;
last night we quickly apologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our t@@ wit@@ s in social media yesterday .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ on &apos;s comments relate to the performance of swi@@ mmer@@ ing in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were inadequate and an unhappy elected wording . B@@ yron is doing what he said , very sorry . &quot;
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was arrested in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it is designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment for me to apologi@@ ze for the comment that I have made after the women &apos;s cre@@ eps in the C@@ BC Olympi@@ as , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have reli@@ ed myself on the power of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I &apos;m very sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged over woman who under@@ wear under@@ garments in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman moved her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ h@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they pat@@ ter@@ ned how they saw it out , moved them out and put them back to the shelf . &quot;
you st@@ agn@@ te further and tasted four pairs of pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the pri@@ mark store in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman was trying to try the pants before she placed her back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ garments , &quot; she moved back and left the shop without shopping . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the stall , she took a pair of pants from the pad , attracted its own shr@@ ank and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a somewhat discreet place to do it - she simply stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ing , when she moved out the pants , who obviously did not like her , because she laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the same with three further under@@ pants , before she finally decided that her turned nothing , moved up again and went off . &quot;
&quot; she did not distur@@ b it , that she observed someone - or think about the person who would buy under@@ pants from circumstances that had tried them . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said , &quot; &quot; How contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take sub @-@ pants from home who had a different person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have contributed , the employees tried to pull the garments out of the sale after she left - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of pants and find out that another woman had her , and did not washed away . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man from Pri@@ mark said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident , which occurred on Tuesday , 9 of August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question were pulled out of the sale .
how to protect themselves with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attack
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ on Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how one deals with armed predat@@ ors at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how you turn around for your predat@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; if one gets closer to you from the rear , then you should turn out to be a ground@@ ing so you can see your att@@ acker and move out of the sight , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
seize the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then beat him with the knee in the bar , and rot@@ ate yourself while the att@@ acker is bub@@ bling out of pain , the weapon of his hands . hit it with the course and move back@@ wards , while they set the weapon upon it . &quot;
&quot; near att@@ ackers , getting closer to the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the line , grab the gun and rot@@ ate them , so that the att@@ acker may not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight to the gun and beat the att@@ acker to the chest , then rot@@ ate the gun from his handle before they move back@@ wards and direct the weapon upon it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see how it is Miz@@ ra@@ chi &apos;s imagination .
&quot; keep in mind that with a smo@@ b of the safest , your money is excessive - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright se@@ ab@@ t for a guide to his tongue at the dirty places in Europe
a British travel@@ er under@@ went his immune system and saus@@ age by serious testing by taking some of the fil@@ th@@ est and most ec@@ ot@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel@@ er Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k moved his course to a Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ed fast@@ ener , and a public telephone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; before departure each object , he used a s@@ war@@ ometer to show up and show us what it is going to be . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , brought some surprising results of day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought that ble@@ ak the flush kno@@ b of a draw@@ back plate , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely dis@@ sho@@ ck@@ ling , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright said with physicians and medical specialists about the promotion of bo@@ wel bacteria and about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left , what he dropped , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
Mr. Wright was well known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public funds to stations to train stations to the sink of res@@ tro@@ oms , the task put its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told , &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ lu@@ dge war@@ ms . &quot;
in film he was able to meet his reputation for any case .
&quot; the just what he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his trial line showed a s@@ umin@@ om@@ mi@@ le@@ age of over 4000 units .
compared to this the l@@ umin@@ om@@ eters are fresh and less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian res@@ tro@@ om that he refused to deny , after their l@@ umin@@ om@@ eters over 4000 units was , while freshly washed hands are one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel box &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I have in a toilet , near . &quot;
there is no desp@@ on@@ dent than that !
I will do nothing here because it is in@@ cor@@ tical here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company tac@@ kled Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that &apos;s fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiot@@ ics .
&quot; we led mad bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by , the so we told that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the meaning of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers more information in an interesting manner .
&quot; I also think , that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour ! &quot;
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have tasted my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I have reli@@ ed to him , just like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things where it was easier to bring Ian , to look at , and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; I am glad , that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
&quot; in a survey conducted by the year 2015 associ@@ ated 84 percent of all surve@@ yed sp@@ ill@@ aries , in particular with the well @-@ being of gast@@ ro@@ intestinal and bo@@ wel and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products , the attached mil@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance Social @-@ Hou@@ ses in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social @-@ dwelling after a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because they were terrorist . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were cast after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after they were rolled out from their property , they found the property found in an irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls recorded aff@@ lu@@ ent holes , wooden sh@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped , trash was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to walls . &quot;
the family have been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , which works for the management administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer to fix . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; It was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people do not have to live in that way . &quot;
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is thought to be seen as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment in the meantime , and the police said that the terror that the family had inf@@ licted , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ ists , involved in shy from residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , was in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old garbage has been found . &quot;
&quot; they were found in the estate , which were tra@@ ded in the past drugs , the timber ri@@ mp@@ s . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them fighting on the street and regularly had to be called the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing deleg@@ ated them and their partners this week by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ans were rejo@@ iced by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; She turned out to no one . &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here , are incredible . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have dreamed the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , which the police had been set up at regular intervals , 20 years long . &quot;
on the crowded side of the municipal building were hin@@ dered rub@@ b@@ ish rub@@ b@@ ish rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it was administered by the ten@@ ant , any responsibility for their behavior and the family , as an Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance is always the last step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot;
&quot; this was a very difficult case , since the behaviour was extremely difficult and had to be terri@@ bly interested in their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have gr@@ ace@@ ful to us and have made us the information to come . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will sp@@ ade con@@ sol@@ ace to some neighbours , and the message is taught that anti @-@ social behavior is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived in the house at different times , but they are all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication on the ground . &quot;
workers of house management are now forced to wait in the garbage dump of the house that surround the house
in 2014 the police conducted a raid on the house and found above 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ nia and cash at an altitude of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was granted a fine penalty after they had become guilty of the own@@ ing of a drug @-@ owned class B in Handels@@ ab@@ ia .
&quot; she claimed that the money was a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who came to life in 2013 by car accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without ob@@ l@@ ach , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many carp@@ enters of the house were awarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will serve r@@ enter , who do not believe in the house@@ order &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared a clear warning to the other tenants which do not believe in the house@@ order .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those who were damaged by such a behavior . &quot;
&quot; the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior , who continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen have had the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; Coach Luis Enri@@ que under@@ took this to a clear decision on this until now and caused Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er Ste@@ gen took the advance in most of the other applications . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new game play , there are doubts about the fitness level of the crew who were humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool : 4 . &quot;
also at the 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convinced .

last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympia podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the plate alone , between the sets and when time outs they had no coaches . &quot;
they withdrawn on the ble@@ ach@@ ers and left their tren@@ ches at a fair competition on each other .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches , until here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the finale I play for myself , &quot; &quot; had pointed fold . &quot;
after the Parti@@ cip@@ ate World War of gold and silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China Flag .

Donald Tr@@ ump Sec@@ t ″ tremendous problems ″ in the electoral fight
&quot; the leadership of the U.S. Re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative federal states to settle their majority . &quot;
presidential @-@ did@@ geri@@ d@@ did@@ at Donald Tr@@ ump would now have weaknesses of its election campaign in the former Republi@@ can High burg Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the normally large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ ster@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has expressed something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after spending 16 Rival within the own Republi@@ can camp from the race , the doubt grow in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; Tr@@ ump said about evangel@@ ical Christians , which he asked for support in key states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; to blame , false reports of his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media addiction . &quot;
Republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ down
Utah is usually a secure bank for the Republi@@ can Re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his deputy was written by the Democratic , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that is common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered also .
&quot; in an interview of the Sender CN@@ BC answered Tr@@ ump to the question , how he wants to stop the advance of Clin@@ tons , &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back , I will be &quot; &quot; successful &quot; &quot; or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
&quot; he is doing nothing else , as &quot; the truth to tell . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him for the end for reasons of political correctness , this is in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I come back to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press report , the Party of Tr@@ ump would have been threatened , funds to support his election campaigns , should he be able to present no better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of it , the candidates of the Republi@@ can be stronger for the Congress . &quot;
Olympia : Dre@@ ams fraud in D@@ oping test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary commission to the case .
K@@ eni@@ as Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ ten is threatened after the second D@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud trial in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to home . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee , as soon as possible to set up a disciplinary commission to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village have given a urine sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ itt@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership K@@ eni@@ as from the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the global association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to enlarge its own investigations , and a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and subsequent measures of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; says it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station and turned out to be a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , issued the sample and signed , &quot; explained Ken@@ y@@ as chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
&quot; he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes , who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping agency . &quot;
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i was in 2015 over 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days before , the Ken@@ yan Lei@@ ch@@ re @-@ Deleg@@ ation@@ chief Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted by the Rio @-@ Games . &quot;
it is intended to have informed against budgets and sports@@ men of his country via the pending d@@ oping test .
media reporting says that he was arrested in Nairobi on his return at the airport in Nairobi .
Kenya has been under special observation at IO@@ C in Kenya for a long time .
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping purposes set out above the Rio Olympics , it was noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympia start .
&quot; in the episode , W@@ ada ts from the list of countries whose D@@ oping fight against the rules of W@@ ada are . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won most of the medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , the ARD , over again , were re@@ pro@@ ached again that in Kenya D@@ oping funds are easily accessible and there is a significant mentality of the sport set . &quot;
IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und challenged a similar investigation in Kenya as he had made them in Russian athle@@ tics .
&quot; in this process , it could be proven that in this sport @-@ wide area @-@ wide and systematically sealed . &quot;
&quot; as a result of Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics , we were excluded from the summer of summer . &quot;
Salzburg Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival will present the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Mary as a tragic loving couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with this a surprisingly Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a Musical has conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical to the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a teen@@ ager .
in orchestr@@ al the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan conductor Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we are always saying that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we have Bern@@ st@@ eins music really in our blood !
the Bart@@ oli plays a col@@ lu@@ de in this staging .
she recalls with melanchol@@ y on her lovers with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because they are musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it is clever , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very , my Italian character , which I used as a Roman , lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an extremely generous person .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
rigi@@ dity is for him a necessity .
&quot; one sees it in every of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip Championship . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it is about prejudices and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we left the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ y@@ ans have gone to New York and the New York inhabitants did not want it . &quot;
&quot; they are the same themes , and they are as powerful today as at that time . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

&quot; S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died shortly after her family , after she had pre@@ tended to leave the war of war and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good in it is - as reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks to go into a war area - to prevent people from taking this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA and two other school girls from east London climbed into a plane towards Turkey , and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

Turkey : Kurdish church is counting on mass destruction
&quot; who is not adap@@ ts and Erdo@@ gan , sitting on paved bags , &quot; says the cro@@ wning of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a short @-@ term protection from Turkey to Germany , from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; &quot; several thousands &quot; , &quot; the exile Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard pre@@ occupation of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , following the coup attempt , the Kurdish church is expecting a mass destruction in Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with ten thousand men looking for thousands of thousands of thousands of refugees from Turkey in Germany , if Erdo@@ gan regime fought the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the President @-@ president Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; world &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government was passed away from Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ airs , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey have been on the escape . &quot;
&quot; after the failed coup , s@@ cul@@ ars and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be sup@@ pressed in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees , produced refugees in their own land , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Prime Minister , the targeted settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in Alpine cities . &quot;
so that Erdo@@ gan would increase the emigr@@ ation to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last major minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or sold over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also the CD@@ U member . &quot;
the President called for the Federal Government to be positioned as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers .
also in Germany I find a &quot; Hex@@ en@@ jag@@ d &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
during the last months I haven &apos;t been feeling safe in Germany for the first time .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other acade@@ mi@@ cians of their professional existence .
&quot; who is not adap@@ ts and Erdo@@ gan , sitting on wrapped bags , by the way also the Kem@@ alist and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation Dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper reports on appeal to numbers of the Federal State Department , the Turks adopted the largest group of asylum seekers in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; on the reference date of 30 June , this is 11 @-@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all accepted as the asylum accepted ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , there is not the war on war , poverty , or the fu@@ tility of sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are only political , i.e. , by the state side , individually per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; to go , where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals get nothing of the summer campaign to vote - and the vac@@ ation@@ ers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia should not choose the country &apos;s day .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2005 , the urban election will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays , the heav@@ en@@ camp@@ ine Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; after so far , it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ sw@@ amps - this is swe@@ eping . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the electoral campa@@ ig@@ ners , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most holiday@@ makers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not natives , so they are not allowed to choose the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; these come practical problems : during the holidays are hel@@ pers to hang the posters , air balloon , fl@@ yers and end up in the end voices are just lab@@ orious back . &quot;
&quot; by the 4th of September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to be gone over by the people of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win cel@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the highest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strongly new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able difference .
&quot; cel@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , makes an almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its big pl@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; he travels through land , distributed Roses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , as it did already be his legendary @-@ known predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise past@@ ering has given cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel &apos;s blame for the flowering of the Af@@ ales .
&quot; your refugee policy , you &quot; We create the &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably be the pleasure for him now . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top grade data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of the campaign . &quot;
she has invited her chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to large @-@ minded society ; Merkel parliament ag@@ grav@@ ate @-@ circle is in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group was not , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Western Pom@@ er@@ ania . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other Länder , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but there is too bad no one to hear from other corners of Germany , once Angela Merkel . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U is largely avoided on the usual electoral campa@@ ig@@ ings on market places and mainly shopping m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , so Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordinate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has noted that you have pushed away the base on the land , that it must be very difficult to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are going on like the left , the SPD , the Green : in the expan@@ ses of the country hardly any . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U electoral campa@@ igning to his collaborators , however , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; you have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ est , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party needs to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is at stake , cel@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats recently put forward with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just just before the Af@@ ales ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; during the election of 2011 , the SPD had still very clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Greens , a small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should give the leap into the country &apos;s day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue of the holidays and make up a modern virtu@@ es and embarrass@@ ed its electoral campaign to the internet .
&quot; online @-@ Elec@@ tions &quot; , &quot; calls the state @-@ of @-@ the Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green electoral campa@@ ig@@ ners on a search for native voice @-@ singers is among the tourists .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the peak of the can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t straight with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ gic lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; election in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : guest houses suffer from lock@@ out
&quot; the speed , with which the B 27 will be refurbished , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 am in the morning and end only at 8 pm , there is all@@ u@@ ties praise . &quot;
&quot; they have made all quite jag@@ ged , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no de@@ duction .
&quot; the building site could be moved on the weekend at the half @-@ time plan@@ ing to the south , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; praised is also the opposing of those responsible for construction , for example , when it comes to setting up accommodation facility . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south , and also the blocking of the asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted , and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has also been relaxed , the traffic situation within the place is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 again .
the smo@@ other traffic through the place seems to be returned .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ er@@ strasse , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ r@@ ach@@ strasse and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many Sch@@ leich@@ katze sought and rather their Nav@@ i trusted than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks in residential areas were fran@@ tic .
&quot; therefore the speed limit has not been met , the community has increasingly called the brass vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable abundance &quot; , &quot; says King , who made himself an expert on the spot . &quot;
there were already two to three per minute .
the fastest was with 77 hour @-@ kilometres in the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site moved further , it was qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg is now open the road again .
business@@ men do not like to look into the cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation has led to revenue growth in them , each one you ask . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less concerned . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; final customer &quot; , &quot; so for other companies , it has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also with the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; low decrease &quot; , &quot; but also an that of course &quot; the tre@@ adm@@ its is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the Local along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the hosts made it hard . &quot;
&quot; it was lacking the customers of He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we have to be glad about every euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue grew to &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Stre@@ ens@@ ing began its operation &quot; for two years . &quot;
half of his staff have to release him .
if I had a company with 4000 people and half would have been released would politics have been re@@ acted .
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has on a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference , the restaurant benefited from the advantages of the location on the B . now it also has the disadvantages , which surrender through the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where it was dealt with a bit generous .
&quot; in all charges , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue on . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars are less common now because of complicated transportation , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if one cannot drive , it is also elsewhere . &quot;
that his tribal climate after the end of the re@@ organisation comes back again and G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it .
&quot; despite the crises of BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on his cli@@ ent@@ ele for the biggest crisis , which has experienced its hospitality in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is even brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , the Minister of Mai@@ zi@@ ère has now found a big safety package . &quot;
but what has a dem@@ ul@@ ating status with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the conc@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals are expected to be &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; says the Federal Minister for the launch of his new safety package . &quot;
they are demanding anyone .
&quot; other , further points would be discussed at first within the parties . &quot;
&quot; also , I am sharing . &quot;
&quot; but as a Minister of Minister , he was placed on results and on a &quot; for@@ ged consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before completing his conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
but this is now all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the cho@@ p co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; also , not the fact that Germany must implement multiple EU guidelines for passenger commercial data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for safety agencies is likewise not surprising .
&quot; partly de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second startup for suggestions , which had not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to face sympath@@ ies for terror groups , and jihadists having double citizenship in the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; the CD@@ U man . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he still consider this to be reasonable , and demanding nothing that does not have any chance at the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner . &quot;
a few new ideas will also be presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
&quot; in part , it is planning to make quick procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more opportunities for the detention of people from deportation . &quot;
&quot; refugees trying to get targeted into the country , they should then check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a safety inspection before . &quot;
&quot; in D@@ ul@@ ties for distr@@ ust asylum seekers , he wants to ask some worse than so far - about such crimes that commit crimes or their papers are aware of their identity . &quot;
some of this is politically and legally protected .
some also works un@@ pronounced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and in some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example , the question arises : what does this actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , say de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be answered in paragrap@@ hs that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg refugees were .
&quot; moreover , many people were worried about the high refugees who are worried about the safety . &quot;
and things that deeply employed people did not hide themselves in election times .
the inner security is enormous in the focus .
&quot; first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
the Union and the SPD can therefore become increasingly in position for internal security .
in the past few days it went high between the two parties .
&quot; only a gar@@ ter dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a safety @-@ policy collection of some Uni@@ ons Minister , in which the res@@ ignation as well as a bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citizenship are demanding . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return from the double pass he kept nothing .
we have gr@@ asp@@ ed the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ arrange it is not useful .
and at a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable , &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there is a lot in what could be done for dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is also trying to pro@@ claim the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party Chief Sig@@ mar Gabriel is sign@@ aled first to talk about inter@@ viewer and says , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that helps us enhance security further . &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ estones comes through .
&quot; despite diesel technology , the number of suppliers will rise worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it goes round .
&quot; in case of appropri@@ ation , there is a notion about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the disp@@ at@@ ted deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; Europe &apos;s largest car@@ makers can be compared with the previous year , despite the presence of many brands and some well running markets further a plus . &quot;
&quot; but in July the wind@@ brand VW mainly weak@@ ened in Western Europe , and thus dist@@ res@@ sed the overall sales as the company quoted in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , the VW brand sold with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , China is the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the birthplace of Germany the supplies for nearly a sixth constitutes .
br@@ anding Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker numbers from July to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there have been a res@@ tra@@ int in some core markets due to &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote also charged for leaving the EU , explained a spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the g@@ asi@@ an aff@@ lic@@ ts first escal@@ ate , there is also further a minus to book . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; altogether , the mainly affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is due to the sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is merely an exemp@@ tion of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
Executive Director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to advance a sales split from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more vehicles supplied Volkswagen at this time , 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated using a software dispens@@ ation .
&quot; alone in Germany , VW offers about 2.5 million cars for the re@@ armament in the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW , that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ armament of the vehicles , there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers present the customer after the re@@ armament a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but not of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was meant on Friday in business travel . &quot;
reason are legal abilities .
&quot; focus &quot; &quot; Focus &quot; &quot; had reports that Volkswagen grants its German customers a guarantee of sophisticated diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed by the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs .
coming from the State Department has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has to fulfill the conditions of my enquiry commission , and of the KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations of this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after retro@@ fitting cannot take place and all the type @-@ relevant vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; warranty &quot; &quot; but not , as was meant to be in a company journey . &quot;
&quot; in the wide term &quot; Guaran@@ tee &quot; Volkswagen provides the possibility that customers get back for example a half year after retro@@ fitting , for instance , with a motor @-@ damage in a workshop - and this can lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in customer interest , it is important to avoid that in any other damage , there is no need to do with any other damage resulting in uncertainty regarding possible cav@@ eat emp@@ t as it was called . &quot;
therefore VW use the term &quot; warranty &quot; not .
Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires rich savings in future criminal prosecution - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Bank director Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is just about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of an individual case and does not see it as a signal , &quot; &quot; normal &quot; &quot; would not have to be feared to pay for their austerity criminal offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; warehouse banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
this charge does not require the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros on pl@@ ro@@ or or daily accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs will cost 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; it has been around 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another and which he could not fail . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me in the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank chief . &quot;
&quot; I cannot place a million euros for every million euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the costs shall be further followed by the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; to let cash simply lie in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , it would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four incidents , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; &quot; said the bank . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and rarely on other investment forms .
only few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative union of Bavaria explained : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB will cause considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to wear alone , &quot; &quot; commercially viable is not permanent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for balance , credit cards or credit transfers . &quot;
&quot; with criminal investigation for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gia of People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger operates with its Sk@@ at@@ bank @-@ branch 2014 Head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , chief executive manager of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t expect Individu@@ als to pay high @-@ end withdraw@@ als for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there are &quot; &quot; a cliff , which is fu@@ eled by the property somewhat lus@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; this can be a problem for a small bank , if they hat@@ ch free money . &quot;
&quot; the newly established cooperative bank G@@ mund has two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative of Bavaria , &quot; &quot; Bayern &quot; &quot; is currently not known any other banks that charge a compensation for in@@ soles of private customers , &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Reserve of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained the threshold to the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the neg@@ atives is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it threaten the emigr@@ ation from investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany have not fallen in the width .
destination plates : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men love middle ages love plates .
&quot; before reaching a comment , in order to sow him under the pseudon@@ ym non @-@ Al@@ le@@ vel@@ ing men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the sound@@ proo@@ fing of records does not want to see on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who want to welcome the unity of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased one record are all forecast after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des through hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older collectors reserve their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend alone time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do you agree with the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera , while in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o run , before I ste@@ al , keep my hands and say something certain of that : so , let us take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly on its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there still are a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops , trying to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men aged aged ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , probably around the 20 ) follow , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector that I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have around 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed by him ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford , when they had appeared and once again to buy objects that he sold when he was young and bank@@ rupt . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are from the late six@@ ties , early 70@@ ies which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I was probably something too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy plates , are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend alone time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink very much . &quot;
this is my push .
&quot; CON@@ Z , 25 who works at S@@ ister Ray , also believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and can be seen to get back their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I managed , people normally get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to get back their records &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the non @-@ contact payment system . &quot;
&quot; some plate @-@ fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to rec@@ tan@@ gle about the stability of familiar sound cases , of objects that wak@@ eup with the happy Yugosla@@ v inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it may be a filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s like that with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes a staff from a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people , who bought last month a record , they have not heard yet . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % possess a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned while I sw@@ aying a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the re@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone came only recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
this is not a large percentage but it will definitely happen .
more Produc@@ t@@ less , less musi@@ kl@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who can only get slowly . &quot;
&quot; over that the sound plates has almost a whole floor , has a pale crowd when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle aged . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ tur@@ bo pop , instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them sees son@@ ly lonely , but wet @-@ mental trau@@ mas is hard to set if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for some minutes in business and considers the vari@@ et@@ eness of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to make a showcase than a large purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collector of plates is not a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from one computer or in another way but the beauty of records is ... it drives off with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban out@@ fit . &quot;
&quot; while I give the semb@@ ling the jeans Hot@@ spot to mu@@ sts , I observed a group of young teen@@ ager , group@@ ed up for a moment to buy pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter think to buy a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody sees it at - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to grip them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the sector , and some buyers could send in the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , the one that is most for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research results apply that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record business and in online for@@ en . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the be@@ trot@@ ter through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaf through plates , while they ste@@ er the rigid glance of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator that overlooks the shoulders of middle aged men . &quot;

&quot; a French Court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , living in the thousands of refugees . &quot;
&quot; during a trial proceedings , this week , the authorities argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 provisional shops in which individuals within the camp goods , from cigarettes to duck , sell , hair@@ dressing services or to sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 P@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few Euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down , because they would constitute a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which re@@ els a fire and san@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared with the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals are offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; they also led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation , and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 provisional business , but to understand that the concerns raised by Cal@@ ais &apos; pre@@ tend is absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just to feed people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of quiet meeting between refugees and volunteers are offering .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is commonly practiced and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum seekers for hundreds of vulnerable age groups in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was meant that the shut@@ ters would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid agencies help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migr@@ ants died on Friday that the number of living people living in the jungle @-@ camp have risen to more than 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals over the summer .

here comes the En@@ forcement trailer
&quot; Germany Ras@@ ch must set itself on the next generation of speed engines : in different federal states , inter alia in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the temp@@ pos@@ ing of especially effective . &quot;
the futur@@ istic acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at random points where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measuring by the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary tem@@ pole , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed of speed up there with a stationary bl@@ itzer . &quot;
a durable mobile structure can however be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery keeps five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser met@@ rology , all vehicles can also be captured over several tracks at the same time . &quot;
&quot; variable speed b@@ umps , as well as the departure ban to time , lanes and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in high @-@ time condition you can move the trailer according to manufacturer with each car with tags .
&quot; so that it is not simply che@@ wed , it is lowered in measurement , so that the wheels are in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and also disappear narrow out@@ si@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
since 2015 the trailer has been tested according to the display of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and by now also used .
&quot; also foreign authorities of lightning with the new technique : recently , France has followed 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
Britain fet@@ ches silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten up in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji shared a master class in handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , post @-@ back , line @-@ line and ro@@ wer power to win gold - their first Olympi@@ am@@ ed@@ aille of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was swe@@ pt away by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal -- Britain fourth on that day - and they could certainly be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they proposed New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the distinct defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ finals on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
but independently of it Fi@@ ji would have been a 15 @-@ man team in existence .
&quot; it could be a sol@@ ace for UK - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former chief of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind himself .
they had lost eight years ago at Ry@@ an &apos;s play at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
&quot; here , they lost only one . &quot;
&quot; this s@@ lugg@@ ish is we@@ d@@ ded , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and took the attacks GB@@ s out of fun .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and Co. at , as if one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au was over@@ flowing in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of play , Jerry Tu@@ wai and another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly accepted the ball .
&quot; an early detection of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it has only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner will be a touch@@ down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the re @-@ start and there was still about one minute game time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ ets through further weak tac@@ kles of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is so , as if Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while GB is still da@@ unting . &quot;
this is the way it is .
&quot; GB resulted in fundamental changes to the half @-@ time , and closed the fi@@ ery gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , until Joshua tou@@ is@@ ova ran through a brilliant Inter@@ play by Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started making an attempt for GB , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran for a long time in favor of the southern overseas sul@@ try whose fans s@@ aves , tor@@ ches and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake icing on a further attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the fi@@ fi@@ ff , the Fi@@ j@@ is revol@@ ves and GB ki@@ cked off in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; previously , Fi@@ ji Japan had conquered in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain in a scarce half @-@ final match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive footprint and scored a gate among the post in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late , written by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side Team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ ship gold than with these games and that wants to be what is hot .
&quot; from the first stroke of rowing to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve , which go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat down on the Ru@@ ins , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present as she was invited to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax wife , the first women in the history of British sport that were on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her dominance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter imp@@ aired use , which is also unparall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ ins , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not the way of the triumph it becomes ge@@ ge@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rest of the Ru@@ ins , a batt@@ ali@@ on dedicated to willing hoo@@ ks that make the difference and there was no one more than the coach , who would not survive this day at all , when it was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
as he said he was risky .
I had bladder cancer that is operated and they did so .
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a rather horrible situation .
it changes a bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck , that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , could begin what the break kept to a minimum in the case of such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran around on the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet to a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is a challenge , but this makes it even greater . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ medi@@ ability of victory , her first thought of Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ cking morning doing something more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal arti@@ ll@@ ery regim@@ ent in a bet in Afghanistan , &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it is repeated only , how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost any race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm which won &apos;t cope with her opponents .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to start up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve . &quot;
we were very in the moment trapped .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , abi@@ ding in the process . &quot;
it really is important to not let itself be carried away .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we didn &apos;t want to make it out of it . &quot;
&quot; we wanted no fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that that was my last race .
that could have been so much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ress . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years has been exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ ed G@@ öl@@ ler &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
the association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian . &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ functional association as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of some time ago in the original of the Bav@@ arian Rund@@ funk .
little later the water@@ forum of the government of sub@@ fran@@ ken made the second @-@ union .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ er@@ ein@@ te &quot; Bav@@ ern@@ far as exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the two @-@ time personnel , was 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was admitted to retirement in the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose of the V@@ eit@@ s , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality latitude , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches church lou@@ der , Wi@@ brunn , Lau@@ brunn , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and municipalities there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current president , latitude , mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was hired as a water @-@ wart and was appointed Managing Director of the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very varied and they extended from the water management and maintenance work via office and organisational activities , the bud@@ get@@ ary creation , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency places at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the multip@@ licity of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; it has never been a stand@@ still , and I have always added new features because water life and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her hom@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised Gö@@ llers &apos;s loyal , reliable and accurate service for 31 years . &quot;
&quot; it has been used with a lot of heart blood for his water@@ purpose , and it has lived right in the water @-@ purpose , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group to the nit@@ rates before the water forum of the district underground . &quot;
he received a lot of recognition and praise for this .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ one praised Wasser@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greeks who worked with him for 28 years .
he is the best water@@ sk@@ e@@ eper and he was a faithful puppy .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the Brun@@ nen@@ bau and the struc@@ turing of the two . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the tough@@ est use were to be the pi@@ ping at the floo@@ d@@ der of the river @-@ lou@@ der on a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the care of Neu@@ brunn one can only be sustained once you filled the container @-@ container from P@@ ett@@ stadt .
the management of drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel falls from Lau@@ ter who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

&quot; a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man has shot at a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) , and it fatal . &quot;
&quot; the man has called for himself with us , and is given to have shot his mate , &quot; &quot; said a police pre@@ occupation . &quot;
&quot; the do@@ er is on the run , and after him I will be publicly challenged . &quot;
&quot; now nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , brown , and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
by now the man carries a bal@@ ding .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still bear the weapon with himself , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. looks , is supposed to call 110 people . &quot;
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was the year 1988 , the killer 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the competent police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no data on the Ta@@ ther@@ ach , or the relationship between perpetrators and victims ; but they confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a foolish . &quot;
&quot; more we are not saying currently , &quot; &quot; said a police pre@@ occupation in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witness report@@ edly was a special command ( SE@@ K ) on the scene .
steel - bright spot for the German steel industry
the fer@@ rous and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in millions of millions .
financial bur@@ dens resulting from the industry from the eco @-@ electricity support are from the table .
&quot; it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Effici@@ ency in the component for the so @-@ called custom @-@ production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Bundes@@ Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday @-@ over@@ s ) . &quot;
I am really happy that after two years we could finally start negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer to ask the gases from the ho@@ m to generate electricity for their own consumption , in order to register . &quot;
the steel industry declined additional costs from 120 to 240 million euros per year according to the German branch of industry .
&quot; Gabriel said of the WA@@ Z , there are now a fundamental certificate with the EU Commission for discussions with competitive Com@@ miss@@ arin Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , in case an EEG circulation of 20 percent . &quot;
but even these will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany with the European Commission for self @-@ reliance .
&quot; with this , the status quo of the date scheme will be largely fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful attempts of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of the emission standards are climate and employment targets , &quot; &quot; declared IG Metall boss Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from the financial crisis in 2008 and considerable price pressure .
&quot; last year , the situation was further intensi@@ fying when the world &apos;s world &apos;s largest terrestrial demand had already cast strong steel to the world market in view of the weak@@ est domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers f@@ oss Chinese steel @-@ sh@@ ell@@ ings and dumping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has a little relaxed . &quot;
&quot; at one point the import duties on imported goods shall be revealed , and the other have the economic prospects in China . &quot;
how sustainable the pri@@ re@@ conditioning is unclear .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have more stag@@ nat@@ ing . &quot;
the industry respon@@ ds to the difficult situation with more cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also wanted to exclude safe lock@@ ings of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain vigil@@ ant in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3,4 million tons , they produced more than six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , such as the Steel association of steel on Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the set was left behind the second month in a row .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is only two percent below the previous year &apos;s level . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association anticip@@ ates an improved business situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , Mind , Health : singing doing senior &quot;
&quot; the singing has UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , in the mag@@ ister@@ ium and today she sings the F@@ ach music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a Sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; they sing me - emotional and physically , &quot; &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample she feels balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
she is doing something good for her health and spirit .
&quot; for singing is right from several perspectives an amazing hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German seniors . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing along the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
by regular contrac@@ tion you can build and maintain social contacts .
&quot; since frequently , social and family structures arise at age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in her choir : to speak and organize , to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in a positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; for this , seniors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; whoever asks his lungs regularly , does not work as fast in everyday life as soon as the Pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , S@@ ingen often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the federal labor community of senior organizations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or hearing of songs when elderly people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
by Li@@ ed@@ ly@@ te and especially melodies arise themselves and crus@@ hed people in a long history .
&quot; in singing , the head is also required for a particular achievement , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , exercise not only to focus on himself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir says H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows by the singing in chor@@ us .
&quot; to show yourself : if I be long for something , I &apos;ll be better and more vigil@@ ant about me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says , have little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you never sings alone - with 50 sin@@ ful men who hear , if a sound is next to it ? &quot;
in search of the suitable offer seniors have different possibilities ; says H@@ ac@@ kler .
&quot; sings from the familiar @-@ circle in a old rec@@ ench@@ y@@ ma , one can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of choirs in the area .
anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church as a church .
many seniors can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , may ask the family , friends or neighbours to help with the intervention . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing , should be connected to a choir , betra@@ ys H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing the soul well and has something liber@@ ating - this applies to any age .
cats react sensitive to cat on cri@@ es of the young
&quot; bi@@ ologists have studied in Hanover , the effect the rod of kittens have fallen into adult animals . &quot;
&quot; at their surprise , the Mi@@ ghty did not let the males go cold - however , they kept in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal levels of kittens .
&quot; they will be able to spot ten per cent faster on foli@@ te of kittens resulting in great distress , such as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medizin@@ ische Hochschule Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;
K@@ ater also react to the swing of kittens - but always the same .
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the mi@@ rage of less and strongly aroused vir@@ g@@ ents for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is first authorised to be published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found out that the duration and sound height of the bi@@ b @-@ cri@@ b will be distinguished with the urgency of their assistance . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult boys and eight females were observed from the animal @-@ keeping of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were played for a swing of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the throw box and separated by both mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ aming of stronger kittens , which were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers keep their results despite the small sample of the sample for out @-@ to @-@ say .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the cri@@ es , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
rot@@ ate faster to the loud@@ speaker when this call@@ out of the very sli@@ ppers were dis@@ crete .
this ability may be alleged or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have responded in at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied several times in humans the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noises . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , as they were as mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes up with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ fe@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey a warrant has been issued against the erst@@ while football @-@ star Hak@@ an Sü@@ fe@@ i .
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , a major football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ riv@@ als Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as a bone . &quot;
&quot; already in the suspension of the state of emergency , after the overthrow in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ hing would not be affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are susp@@ ects , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the attempt of coup . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is not done before the football club . &quot;
against the previous Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ fe@@ r the pro@@ secutor filed an arrest warrant .
&quot; according to this , the South East in America is now being accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
South @-@ cows is supposed to be followers of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held accountable by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the attempt of coup .
&quot; although it is initially limited to October for 90 days or until October , in fact , it does not affect the life of the Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places in the whole country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in followers and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &apos; visit &apos; visit was traditionally not one of the friends of the president .
what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict denial of military coup .
even the fans agree - no matter whether their heart beats Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or sightseeing .
with Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala &quot; it will be especially coming back to Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
&quot; his sporting value represented the Köl@@ ner in the preceding season : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions ended the 31 @-@ year @-@ old his first playing time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his organisation . &quot;
in the end@@ game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 @-@ seals .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place .
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to Pol@@ di , the disappointing season for the record master took a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; are also off in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only ran@@ ged to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we managed and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master visits the game was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal figures as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ go@@ al@@ en@@ kö@@ nig was the base of the 14th titles . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the AC Florence did not visit the Lisbon Treaty , and only borrowed Gom@@ ez after Putin &apos;s attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only needs to say , &quot; &quot; the &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &apos;s &quot; &quot; club @-@ chief &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to this end , the falls should be ready to ren@@ oun@@ ce around a third of his to 7.5 million euros . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have even medals chances in Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
&quot; furthermore , athle@@ tics @-@ sin@@ ner &apos;s sin@@ ner can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio to medals . &quot;
the topic of dop@@ ing determines the headlines about the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian s@@ amp@@ ant in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had been compl@@ ained about playing after a dop@@ ing spar@@ re , was sealed for their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ aden@@ los and baked . &quot;
&quot; it offered a sk@@ id@@ le scenario : with a sm@@ iled smile she had still stum@@ bled in the hall , and had prov@@ oked with their appearance . &quot;
&quot; when he was determined that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a ju@@ bilee storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who go to the Start in spite of D@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked already for two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since his ban , the Olympi@@ ad from 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , he is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the greatest challeng@@ ers of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin and seven @-@ fold World Championship in had to sit a six @-@ month lock in 2010 after taking the capture of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , I had had strong dental pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old had defended itself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 was positively tested by the Olympics of 2012 , World Championship in 2013 and Europe from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Per@@ kovic entered the current intake , and was locked in six months . &quot;
the four fur@@ rows in this year go to the account of the great Gold fav@@ ored tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ride ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months been blocked . &quot;
a remedy for penis enlargement may have been responsible , stri@@ pped Mer@@ ride . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m of the strongest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athle@@ te were detected as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later , after being noted with him testosterone D@@ oping . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; this also recognized bronze medals for the Olympic Games in 2008 , received due to a part of the International Criminal Tribunal for the International Criminal Tribunal . &quot;
&quot; with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world @-@ Conc@@ ord@@ ant and Gold@@ fav@@ ored tin was first tested in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 @-@ year old world cup , references to taking a banned dietary supplement found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell mild and ran before the 13th of July . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ ent@@ els in Thailand - Su@@ ff@@ in viol@@ ates - Multi@@ t@@ ote T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand stood in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Sn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered chi@@ pped and had been treated in the hospital , but I already left again . &quot;
your home trip has been planned for early September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the vacation island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ on also an Austrian citizen , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in this respect , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in close contact with the local authorities , so dum@@ b . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were explo@@ ded on Thursday of Thursday in a district of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , the police have been killed by Tha@@ il@@ ders and about 20 people have been injured , including the Austrian , three German , three Dutch and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday early , two explo@@ sives went high , and according to the authorities , another man was killed . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket in the morning a bomb attack was reported .
at the Det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach of popular beach Pat@@ ong . police information has been violated a taxi driver .
&quot; at Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the southeast coast of the country , another bomb , which k@@ ills a city of city . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ flower , in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast @-@ police went into the air . &quot;
&quot; finally , de@@ on@@ ations called in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several wounded . &quot;
one goes from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in .
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said Army @-@ Major Dan@@ ai liter@@ al , Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we assume that this is a coordinated attack . &quot;
&quot; it is too early to express themselves as possible moti@@ fs - probably , it is a question of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ate of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Thai police declared that the attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one has to assume that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities have kept secret references to the upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still , it is not clear what group behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police took their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important governmental buildings and airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment areas . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are again smaller bombing attacks , but they are mostly not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the tragic bombing of bombs , the Austrian Foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends to contribute to the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( security level 3 ) for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ na and surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were made a few days following a controversial referendum on a Constitution .
these spatial military could have a great impact in the years to come .
&quot; the Jun@@ ta @-@ Chef and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs have been an attempt to so@@ ften chaos , while the country moved towards stability , improving the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which in 2014 had taken the power after a period of bloody crimes , keeps themselves good , the kingdom has again led to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a grip on the military in the extreme south of the country in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
almost a year ago in Bangkok the attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloody attack of the recent history of the country .
the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; movement &quot; &quot; is lost in the visionary of the Federal Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; after several national offices , the Constitutional Treaty also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; locking points for aspirations against the free democratic fundamental order , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ anders Islamic faith or from the Middle East are bl@@ am@@ ated in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots that has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity through es@@ tran@@ gement . &quot;
&quot; Constitutional Treaty in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Germany , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group , where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extremis@@ ts trying to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the identities of Islam@@ ists just like the right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is not commercial advertising for one &apos;s own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are generally suscep@@ tible .
this is dangerous .
&quot; finally , from several Länder , there had been reports of contacts of &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ D politicians . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , I have no knowledge . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the Constitutional protection , the possible contact of these kinds should be relevant only from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case , the Af@@ ales - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changing its target and thus extrem@@ ist . &quot;
it is crucial if such people have a controlled influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; having a look at the significant increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers , and refugee camps said Ma@@ ate , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this connection . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ ster@@ ous structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can be quite clear that further legal r@@ or@@ istic groups or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other far @-@ right motiv@@ ations . &quot;
but a clear @-@ span or pan @-@ wide control of right @-@ ster@@ ism is not recognizable .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned about , Ma@@ ate spoke about that many ass@@ aults on the account of people left , which previously did not appear in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects on attacks on asylum seekers have not been known as criminals to politically motivated offen@@ ders or followers of the right scene .
&quot; many individuals have off@@ ences committed the previously with legal experts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or elected as CD@@ U , SPD or left , which however , have radic@@ alised by far right @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is used for Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympi@@ ad or world records the headlines from the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer playing in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was temporarily no longer visible in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
&quot; in the social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently used for the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and won the 5@@ 9th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just spor@@ tive figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old is taking part in the Olympic Games ?
Ethiop@@ ians got a special law from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ rated countries well @-@ known .
&quot; since in orthop@@ a@@ ia most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly made the first nickname of the lap .
some media called it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in drawing to a &quot; &quot; Wel@@ fare &quot; &quot; the English bou@@ lev@@ ard sheet &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; made him funny with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played there no role . &quot;
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ i was paying attention to medi@@ al attention . &quot;
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to compete in an over@@ run over 100 meters by Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
fr@@ ene@@ tically became M@@ ous@@ sam@@ i at that time .
at the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old just got to swim eight months before Olympia and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

G@@ FR@@ P tour will lead to disappointing financial figures
the Consumer Science company Gf@@ K conf@@ uses his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .

&quot; after a super @-@ day limestone , the se@@ wage rate in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as the Mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , when the approval of the budget was established by Land@@ scap@@ ego@@ ci@@ ach , that there are sub @-@ covers for these se@@ wage systems . &quot;
&quot; the market Kas@@ endorf has been committed to its legal foundations , operating systems . &quot;
&quot; from October 1st 2016 , the citizen as well as the commercial and industrial companies from world @-@ cat@@ ering , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must gain deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ches are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt in the Panel , was necessary to re @-@ use the fees for the se@@ wage plant in the market . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - and / or sub @-@ covers from the previous cal@@ ender period will be identical . &quot;
&quot; with all three se@@ wage systems , Schmidt founded all three se@@ wage systems with a very low wast@@ e@@ water balance between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to its small distribution , for example , the expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a serious impact . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the wast@@ e@@ water in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; in the backward cal@@ ender period for all three plants , not least due to their age of restoration and repair applications in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; in Az@@ endorf , the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt referred to that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be exchanged for mechanical aer@@ ation system due to a damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk World shr@@ ubs , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led and in the pond @-@ situation Lop@@ p had to be allocated to nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ pond , the frac@@ ture barrier and an additional loading option in order to keep the water @-@ legal specifications in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; at these extraordinary expenses the advanced training and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new cal@@ ender period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous limestone in the years 2011 / 2012 are still significantly below the current level . &quot;
stone houses made clear that in the low wast@@ e@@ water treatment in the three facilities the expenses for the operation and maintenance .
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market of large entertainment costs have remained spar@@ ed during the se@@ wage systems over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the aforementioned systems will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the duration of stone houses , especially since one cannot extend the supply area of the se@@ wage station Fri@@ esen@@ bach@@ tal to these systems , because it is a deficit of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first on zero since October last year was booked as positive 0.@@ 2 % .
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; consumer @-@ price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 0.@@ 0 % , i.e. monthly inflation was 1.1 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of July 2016 was compared to December 2015 ) - 0,@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 was compared to July 2015 -@@ 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , in comparison to the pre @-@ month price , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;

Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; Eff@@ ect as an Asian cartoon
sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ ensi@@ tizing compared to breeds .
with its Filter@@ tool it allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that is already adjacent to absurd .
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or figure which could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ earth@@ ed , independent rot@@ atory tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ enium each day . &quot;
all the mis@@ steps come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filter have drawn criticism in the past critic@@ isms that they have been accused of the app Black@@ face formal or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week struck a filter a filter that gave them sm@@ oul@@ ting , false teeth and raised che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by A@@ sians - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeti@@ tive controversy sur@@ passed to a greater problem that the company has diversity with diversity .
&quot; the news and the outra@@ ge were widespread in Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ chat we@@ ap@@ ed that it would have turned the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was considered to be an homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as a caricature of asi@@ bility .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who have experienced apar@@ is@@ sm , rec@@ alled the filter to vulnerable cl@@ is@@ che@@ es . &quot;
other declined to the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani wrote a Korean American art student , whose twe@@ et was widely used over the photos that the filter &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and mild &quot; &quot; was cancelled . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the return of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not enough , but that the yel@@ lowing has been drawn into the external extreme . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pride .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration process , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in your hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are suffering in matters of race than their older counterparts - could be more likely to expect sen@@ sibility .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filter is an image generated that for a user , it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was in the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to work as a product man@@ ag@@ ger and engineer for medium , to delete their Sn@@ ap@@ chat account , and asked others to do the same . &quot;
in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she told that she believes that r@@ ents @-@ related inspec@@ tors reflect a lack of diversity in adju@@ sting practices at Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the huge part of white ; only male guides and ended their essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said S @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat had largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish any numbers for the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Sn@@ ap@@ chat started to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently employed a staff member who focuses on under@@ stated population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she will let her Sn@@ ap@@ chat Account , and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that that is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military se@@ ab@@ uses ISIS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military members of the United States Central Command changed the way to record an optimistic image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , making an investigation committee of Congress in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the armed members of the armed group , Com@@ promis@@ ist , and the Wehr@@ macht , reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command secret services , reported as superi@@ ors for American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , in short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ intelligence information , which were typically def@@ aul@@ ted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ tours , reported a positive picture of American efforts against terrorism as it had allowed the actual conditions on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; read a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what is happening at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can Member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in Cent@@ Com range up to the top point of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows more detailed ongoing problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to it that government tips given under Obama instructions to change the reports , it shows how analy@@ st faced pressure from their laws , an optimistic image of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements made much more positive in the Congress than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , is so clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the subsequent services to play the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
re@@ public@@ ans called the Task Force into life after being as@@ certain@@ ed that analysts got worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic state .
the report published on Thursday will be comple@@ mented by detailed knowledge during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway , by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defense Department . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for creating studies with regard to Isi@@ l and Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest level of democr@@ at in coma tea , Member in Represent@@ atives of Adam B. ship , known in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; has delayed the publication of rec@@ ital reports , &quot; accused the morality of the analy@@ st and &quot; gave little space for dis@@ so@@ fter opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Schiff and Democrats agreed to have no references to an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com , with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s inspec@@ tor , based on complaints from Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress as the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor are still ongoing . &quot;
&quot; but he also gave that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions concerning the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Defence Department have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
the investigations on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( a claim that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for hon@@ ouring military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the mis@@ information about the Islamic State is remembering constraints of more than ten years ago , as an Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing of many analysts only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time ins@@ ulated to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led around Mr. Hoo@@ ker to mention government agencies , that contrary to the statements by the Islamic State , had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since this provisional release was put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ selfish superi@@ ors , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lature by his over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation in front of the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was reti@@ ring in April and was replaced by the Central Command at Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
the USA wins fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women being a show@@ down with Great Britain
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American fiel@@ d@@ ho@@ ckey team of women in one match against India , that the Americans p@@ ans aged 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , that knows it : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ s on the first place , which remain un@@ defeated by their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday last game in the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first plat@@ former will go to a little longer from the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game might start on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story , four years after they landed over the past London Games in the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sleeping in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport on the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cad@@ res .
then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the subsequent year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , Trainer of the National Team , and with it began to turn things for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not work in London that we now have .
we have the rest of the rest to s@@ nat@@ ch them .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the scor@@ ching in the first half of the game with a bac@@ kl@@ ash out of the local area .
&quot; India was gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing field from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter , until B@@ am took their hands into her hands . &quot;
&quot; he conducted a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and invited the ball to the gate to give the American female a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
as well as B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; among the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of trampoline . &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , there are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid season of competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it &apos;s as if the Olympic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning st@@ ab that is from the bracel@@ et to the swi@@ mmer to the tri@@ mmer .
&quot; you can not switch off the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the shop , without Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Leon or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could quite have been among these known names that could be sent to Prime Time , by sponsors and well @-@ feel TV commerci@@ als , if he would be a swi@@ mmer , tur@@ ner or even fe@@ eder . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event immediately .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally acknowledged : air@@ brush , chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast swimming and may rule it for a long time .
&quot; but if I should humble arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had debut in Sydney , it was noticed the last 16 years so much that many people I asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ type . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had one athle@@ te until 2012 , who made it to final . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans who share the women &apos;s wives .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain outer layer , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explored ear pass@@ ender for a clo@@ wn@@ s@@ school than that sounds for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a dedicated enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ eness of his never to end clou@@ dy of the pr@@ alls - but also the Grazie of the sne@@ aker and diving , the two sports that essentially unites . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as the spring@@ board . &quot;
emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline so shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves ( rotating , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympi@@ ad , you will be evaluated by means of execution , difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; dou@@ bling athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic V@@ ector is straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists hoping to continue in their quest for gold , faster , upward and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes up and back , upwards and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only hunting for the accordion , but in the television transmission , but also another height of the world : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ oriented pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I find yourself when looking at these games as something ti@@ ring .
of this the trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a forward @-@ forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less as an a@@ stron@@ aut , continues upwards , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; which the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot;
N@@ BC is exp@@ elled the En@@ dr@@ as as part of a afternoon @-@ bloc of 2 days from 2.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the object ti@@ fication of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal recently predicted - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey is expecting his breath , new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia as to violent resistance to the government .
witnesses say that seventy @-@ prot@@ esting while clas@@ hes with the police have been killed .
is Ethiopia just to break together ?
&quot; over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid fo@@ ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and expanded in ever more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and slo@@ wed fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the response of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful . &quot;
witnesses said that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot in un@@ armed prot@@ esters and killed .
&quot; moving videos across the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , showing how to hit young people with st@@ aves , while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the boss of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an initial investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; &quot; Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is cher@@ ished by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at the respectable pace .
his infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , with dissi@@ dents effectively transferred to the silence . &quot;
many were sent to exile or in prison or driven to the expan@@ ses of the desert .
but this could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and do not have any other options except to protest , it breaks off , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , an instructor in central Ethiop@@ ies . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the bottom @-@ up to the stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a continuing election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition , and now control 100 percent of the parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions rise along the border to Eritrea ; a battle for this z@@ ag , controversial line called for June hundreds of lives . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ des that were more or less forced in recent years to benefit the turbul@@ ence .
&quot; several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years of pro@@ vocation , under the surface now explo@@ de . &quot;
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with social media , as cheap smartphones have become more frequently and improved the Internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government starts access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially during protests , many people still can communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians said they were so too protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come into mainly Christian high@@ lands , the politics and the economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and living in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing straight .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray who dominated by about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in military , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death on a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts are saying that he was particularly engaged in use early signs of dis@@ content and use special officers to deal with opponents and make them un@@ harmful .
&quot; the present regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected from relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of North Ethiop@@ ian , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the South . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tig@@ ray controlled safety services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia had such a rebellion , in 2005 , after thousands against elections pro@@ mon@@ ed , according to statements by analy@@ st seemingly fu@@ elled by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following swe@@ eps were killed many prot@@ esters , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts , Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure , as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ ality of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ ested in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray @-@ operated shops and the hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts are saying that the protests supported the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ ym to the neighboring Somalia , even though she recently opened , that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; as the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally collap@@ sing in an already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama has been founded ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy , which surrounds his campaign by having said that his several repeated alleg@@ ation , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fying new questions about the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republi@@ can , whether he was able to communicate openly and to communicate with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings his collaborators , who make efforts to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protecting the peculiar position , statements which he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump in regards to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate , the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was simply sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; as the conservative Radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump would help to weaken the statement , by remembering that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS , wanted to know the Republi@@ can presidential attack . &quot;
the last storm of the criticism pointed to Mr. Tr@@ ump while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of random orbit .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this issue .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ tons would bring proposals to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defence .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to himself , when he said the Russians should h@@ ack his emails , however he said later &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ cas@@ tic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the linguistic borders in politics and then go back as required .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages will be absorbed by his fans , how they arrive , and then to clarify &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways .
&quot; instead of trying to def@@ use the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an add @-@ out tone because its survey values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is who was released on Friday , a guided tour with a large lead in the Federal State of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump is generally trying to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying a focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal co @-@ forces into the unpleasant situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ umps prominent inter@@ c@@ essors , gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani , so he was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic state . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Barack ISIS was an almost unknown , small organisation , he called them h@@ ind , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most Mainstre@@ am Re@@ public@@ ans attempt to argue that the government was in charge of Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an external minister@@ ial serving ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them to go on to each of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he for@@ ged the &quot; poor , t@@ wilight &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats have spot@@ ted Mr. Tr@@ umps and a further proof that he is in@@ appropriate for the Presidential office .
&quot; once crossed over the price from the market , Café in Green@@ point returned &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a hab@@ ist café in Williamsburg , where you could pay only cash , which has no Wi @-@ Fi , but last 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was displaced . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie shop , replaced by the ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people considered the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ut wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea hotel except and ver@@ b now is a soap store . &quot;
&quot; but if new York change is , then it is also new . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ vit@@ eb@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ term staff of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he began working with Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; as a customer provided a customer to provide money for a new out@@ si@@ elle , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , retained a lot of things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the dre@@ d@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so @-@ in model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he carried out new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ ages such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natur@@ als .
&quot; the café serves no beer anymore , there are fresh juice . &quot;
after nine months Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ alled current of old stem .
&quot; many old customers were likewise displaced by prizes in Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after being moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way . &quot;
&quot; after the ver@@ b had closed , she gave for a while the coffee t@@ ines appeared , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that it was on the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b , which I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she has coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long and loyal customer since the beginning of the b in 2003 .
he went there before work and always ordered it always the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said he did not have a Gro@@ ll about that the soap @-@ business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie at , a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points have also accepted the café as well . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , saying that he has pre@@ tended to make them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
an ör@@ t@@ ful Saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold bre@@ wed coffee in the bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is broad@@ ened to an interesting building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favor@@ ites .
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a master , and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the entry of the loc@@ as and the bri@@ ghten up a new coffee felt like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell that , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took lunch at the O@@ val office . &quot;
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had an F@@ ai@@ ble for refined delic@@ acy of Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles .
&quot; his menu on this day was a little more modest , filled eggs in tomato sauce , potato pu@@ ree and as dessert a pl@@ um @-@ pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with other people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans , how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; acted by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in an apartment house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as she met with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , oc@@ cured snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh water @-@ sand@@ wich with olive oil , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with mas@@ hed Pot@@ atoes and vegetable @-@ mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ bro@@ ws , this took place the pair of discussing the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut , liver cro@@ se and sav@@ ory . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little bowl which is the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as a dinner .
enco@@ ding gr@@ ste .
&quot; it must have placed in the stomach like a lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years ahead of Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
teams of women cooked for male ri@@ bs and it was served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving European during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; stands out the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the sword . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; &quot; beg@@ ging Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ fulness : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and cas@@ ser@@ ums were used to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ olle as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; mer@@ ging gyp@@ sum , &quot; because chefs could hide un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients under a creative sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced by cheaper drying ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , which was at the center of the American cuisine for years became a rare luxury . &quot;
especi@@ aly mis@@ calculations were tried out as a cal@@ orie and nour@@ ish grati@@ fication takes priority over taste or even healthy cooking .
&quot; during her research for the book , which includes also recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular add @-@ on at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man leads further from : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , household economic - including Louise Stan@@ ley , leader of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 , - the eating habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; by presenting recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; household policy makers and the challenge , pamp@@ as as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical treats . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm cuisine of his kitchen , spe@@ iste he has become like the millions of millions of world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost temp@@ ted menu and took a smo@@ ker .
he was delightful realistic foreign .
&quot; President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to stat@@ u@@ alise his stomach with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the accus@@ ation conducted a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs Roo@@ sev@@ elt , bringing the White House out the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the best prepared food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food to handle , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said , &quot; as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
the pair was better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man &apos;s mother in law - for example they could not throw food off .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; &quot; she actually made ill . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ bag .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they moved and Co@@ e a dessert that had prepared them at home : the pl@@ um of the pl@@ um , the President Roo@@ sev@@ elt , ate lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man said , &quot; &quot; said that there was a common trick , humble recipes to send a new name . &quot;
&quot; there was no chi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped somewhat contradic@@ ted a spo@@ on in the che@@ wy , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ e fet@@ ched itself three times a desc@@ endant .
&quot; like an Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ on he said to his wife , &quot; A couple of h@@ ack@@ ened Wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
at bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died of a façade @-@ bom@@ bed attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which has thus saved the lives according to Bild @-@ Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives in the game to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses , and to help the first aid in the war area . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil mighty , which shows him in a 11 @-@ hour saving of a baby from the ruins of a house , went to the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians for shining symbols in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as a hero , he never seen himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me that is true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , to save lives , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar himself fell victim to the victim , he had spoken in a video about the recent bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have ej@@ ected four boxes over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulties . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play &quot; , &quot; quoted the picture his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest vor@@ tex is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie usually come only in winter to surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship S@@ anna .
it was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; painted swi@@ ms of the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average exactly 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , acceler@@ ates the five meters long animal on s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a ro@@ b . &quot;
this one of long @-@ known lifestyle does seem to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means for vert@@ ebr@@ ates a world record . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evolutionary bi@@ ologist already noted long , that Greenland @-@ ha@@ st@@ one@@ age are old . &quot;
only mis@@ guided the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to watch , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea before the sk@@ inn@@ ed coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter . &quot;
&quot; according to the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie researchers , researchers know accordingly little . &quot;
your time pent@@ emp@@ t Make it when they saved six animals before S@@ val@@ bard around six animals with a transm@@ itter .
&quot; nevertheless , this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a ro@@ b , another had slain the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
&quot; possibly they hunt sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek car@@ c@@ asses , which are from higher water layers to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen as a passenger from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the largest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed the lin@@ sin@@ ks of shar@@ ks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ ker .
&quot; their birth was therefore , after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons attempt to drag greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in which with 220 centimeters length of the smallest animal , the lin@@ ers contained a low surplus to carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had become normal carbon @-@ 14 in their lin@@ ers , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock for a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k will be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k @-@ females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
&quot; due to one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimeters at ease along the cus@@ p to sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
also this is likely to be world @-@ ch@@ ord for vert@@ ebr@@ ates .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ ves live above all in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ on &apos;s tip was caught before Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism is often running on a scale of the animals living there . &quot;
so they mature a bit later - and then slowly .
&quot; in order to warm up in the cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot;
&quot; for the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal buff@@ ers heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is thus able to live more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible , &quot; explains the theory of evolution . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very big animal should invest his resources in a long life . &quot;
construction site in double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the community council has focused on focus on the most recent session . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel took up the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently published housing can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the estate , slo@@ wn@@ ings and request questions are clarified and the applications for survey could be made , the sale of the plots in the residential areas &quot; &quot; road @-@ road &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) to prospective buyers are nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the construction is in rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and hat@@ ch@@ ores alike .
&quot; as it meant , you can report from now at the Town Hall , on the allocation of the plots will probably be advised in his September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also be able to respond to further commercial enterprises , associated with the creation of jobs , then decided to change the municipal council to change only in the spring of this year &apos;s area @-@ saving plan in part @-@ areas . &quot;
this is the case of the sub@@ tempor@@ al market that has been expanded there by two par@@ c@@ els towards state road 2@@ 112 .
Frankfurt profits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of Main has expected to compete with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities , from London to reloc@@ ated jobs and companies . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am benef@@ iting from Bre@@ xit vote , Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , leader of the Compet@@ ence Markets and Real Estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; following the Bre@@ xit @-@ referendum , it is uncertain whether to run money from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
so far for the so @-@ called EU @-@ passport the approval in Britain has been approved for the so @-@ called EU passport .
this is just great US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift .
&quot; lob@@ b@@ alists &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; deals with 10000 new jobs on the Main river in five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the registered office of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is responsible for the monetary policy and supervision of the euro zone &apos;s largest banks , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg has spar@@ ked a large fund , cuts , as well as Dublin for infrastructure worse . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city can be found with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not that easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; along the Seine , the rental rates for first class business properties are 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt am offering a higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in an ranking of the company consulting Mer@@ cer , the city stood on position seven , Luxembourg to place 19 , Dublin to place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of pre@@ di@@ lec@@ tions : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; London , however , will remain in Europe despite Bre@@ xit &apos;s main financial center in Europe , mean the economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; to do so , the correlation of forces : in London , in accordance with figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in late 2015 about 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives right costs from the Hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; an US refer@@ ee decided that Gilead Sciences Inc. claim to the refund of the right costs , which you developed from the hep@@ ati@@ ts C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June Gilead , over $ 200 million were freed from a claim payment of $ 200 million for violation of two patents from Mer@@ ck , related to the block@@ bu@@ ster medication So@@ val@@ di and har@@ sh@@ oni of Gilead , after a US judge a pattern of mis@@ behavior by Mer@@ cy , including the opinion of and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday the law@@ suit of the law@@ suit said on Thursday , US @-@ office in the Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to decree over costs , which were created during the defense of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to attract Gilead with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines which can heal over 90 percent of patients suffering from liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck gave each other compl@@ ained and property on laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir River , active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;

Clin@@ tons earn around 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % Federal control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton published her tax statement for 2015 on Friday , this resulted in the presidential and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ tons USD 1 million donated a charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated a income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax failure of the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ tons was announced in Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
in a temp@@ t opposite to this Donald Tr@@ ump is hidden behind false exc@@ uses and returns with regard to its previous promises to publish its taxes .
&quot; it is custom@@ ary for US presidential data to publish their taxes , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as the reason for his denial of tax examination through the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; Clin@@ tons of voting in Ian Sam@@ s wrote on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential @-@ did@@ atin of Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish anything before the tax inspections are not complete . &quot;
&quot; spot@@ ted critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential lawyers at the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ ci@@ ble that his ref@@ usal issues in relation to assets , its donations to charitable organisations , its affiliates and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday in the high @-@ ranking Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump to release his tax return .
on Thursday she spoke the topic also during a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other presidential attack has done in recent decades and to publish its taxes . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times announced on Friday a number of tax fraud and tax consultants , the indications that this could still be the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become an issue in the election campaign .
Clinton supports a regime that is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ et that would make sure individuals who earn more than USD 1 million earn a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka requested buff@@ ets , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ alists have here his seat , Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their tax failure . &quot;
&quot; buff@@ ets said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; against the voters and not before tax authorities . &quot;
Clin@@ tons campaign has published tax return to 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ tons , who are now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective tax rate of about 32 % between the years 2007 to 2014 and an effective combin@@ able tax rate of approximately 4@@ 0.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the expenditure of the Clin@@ ics of 2015 showed that these only USD 100 of their income received as salary , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main scope was a cost effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons Divi@@ de dividen@@ ds and income of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 . &quot;

&quot; condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des , fire@@ works , promote dance , dance and elephant @-@ protection &quot;
&quot; Natur@@ scor@@ er in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from inhabited settlements , in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them which are filled with chi@@ le pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which had already been the idea ahead of years along with the US natural protection , bringing together volunteers in the north of Tanz@@ ani@@ as , use a non @-@ violent quar@@ antine method to protect their homes and harvest without hurt animals . &quot;
&quot; before , many food have used to defend oneself . &quot;
Friday is the Car@@ pet day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed this ... tool@@ kit we were able to observe a change of their attitudes , whereby they can hold much more confident that they can hold the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants in doing so , &quot; expressed the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps will include the illumin@@ ative of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in an horn .
&quot; if he is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ zz@@ ling with earth is packed together with a fire@@ works per into a con@@ dom whose end up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion is revers@@ ed .
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst in with a kno@@ b and spra@@ yed fine dust at Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ des in the air . &quot;
a breath quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
&quot; one last chance represents an adverti@@ ser , which sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ work in the air and caused a lu@@ te , light explosion . &quot;
city council unanim@@ ous unanimously : no ki@@ osk on the St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; usually , the St. Go@@ al Investment Bank &apos;s investment projects in the trade tra@@ des@@ men who are concerned with Kus@@ sh@@ and - is to be regarded as significantly the retail industry in the core city . &quot;
&quot; however , the motion on the Rhine at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer &apos;s construction in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , however , stopped in close proximity to the city council . &quot;
&quot; basically we welcome new commercial operators , but at this location in exposed position on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk is not going , &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ bre@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director defeats Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; call - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch , after he had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre @-@ election because the Arab guests were requested by an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his trouble at the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel in the hotel country list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between countries which can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
after an explanation the director turned to the hotel reception .
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; looked at him , &quot; &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel stated that the measure was a &quot; &quot; clear decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotels . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , extingu@@ ished in the director even more rage . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they have requested that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the southern German newspaper . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and over@@ thrown by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this has to be worn in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger dis@@ grace . &quot;
this does not require an explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
the incident spar@@ ked a rather big response from the internet where people called the whole a sc@@ andal .
&quot; some provided the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it could have given the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; be ashamed of you , &quot; &quot; was it in another post , in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations from themselves and calling the incident to &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; apologi@@ ze &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel did not enter the quick list , that the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ person of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski hotels . &quot;
it adds that the countries have now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber @-@ ra@@ ging against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students sang together in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police placed Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and Gum@@ mi@@ di against the demonstrators .
&quot; the difficulties began , when police officers were trying to diver@@ ge the students , which led to the police of rubber and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over their plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , slightly less than 100 public schools are closed while 300@@ ,000 students will be implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest@@ ants saw gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ por@@ an walls .
the recent protests occurred some days after prot@@ esters in masses on the streets to support the susp@@ ects President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff launched by a vote of the Senate at their con@@ vocation .
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the turnover rate between Moscow and Tehran in the year increased by 7@@ 0,@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran has been lifted , the interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in the country , shared the Ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies use existing links with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , another trade phenomenon is one of the largest priorities for bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the turnover of trade between Russia and Iran during the first five months of 2016 decreased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports in Iran increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the trade down@@ turn was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan runs for this year from a record of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representatives were around 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 countries , which concerns the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record pay wrong tourists in Russia from last year , broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , some of which the amb@@ ass@@ adors hope that it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d to have received the monuments of the ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : drinks @-@ ar@@ kt in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ bery was practiced on Thursday evening on the drink of RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under pr@@ ero@@ sion of a weapon @-@ weapon demanded three dark @-@ minded people who had um@@ med their faces , from the employee of the beverage Arctic the descending from cash and then fled then on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was exploited , the police does not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 metres in size , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the par@@ deck of the RE@@ WE market and is poorly visible .
&quot; the perpetrators must be rel@@ eg@@ ated after crossing into the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert path , and fled from which opposite the parking @-@ car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction B 256 ( outer ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who made for the incident time ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the rob@@ bery @-@ incident , should be in urgent case with the police . &quot;
n@@ age : games and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and young people of the welfare group / social group work of the children &apos;s vulnerable group and their supervis@@ ors on their summer @-@ free time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ l@@ acker . &quot;
in the quiet nearby Fran@@ con@@ ia Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle was the life @-@ joyful group in the first school holiday week .
several full @-@ day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; for one , we went to Br@@ itt@@ ten with the visit of the Sp@@ el@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other to the mul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special Kinder@@ ski@@ i in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip was to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about the everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days , the group was jo@@ king at the Tie@@ fen@@ see in mul@@ bron@@ n to which to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; culinary children and supervis@@ ors have been spoiled with their self @-@ prepared body@@ guards like the su@@ ction Sp@@ etz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and the T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , nice jewelry pieces of beads and stones were created or made of wood a ro@@ mp @-@ mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the leisure were the fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on the day of visit@@ ation I laugh@@ ed the sun and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ m to the gateway of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral unit E@@ vil Valley @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on their way on a four day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together four stages were tac@@ kled .
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next rum@@ mage of all the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts over the next two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts of St. Anna has chosen to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage objectives have been examined and decided finally for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ ate town of Freiburg , where this year , in the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , he opened a special pilgrimage destination in the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from inv@@ oc@@ ation , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ ero@@ oms were on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before the pastor , the pilgrims sent in a small party in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b by train at the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also a Münster un@@ ser@@ er loved wife , and so the pilgrimage route was taken away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day trips were used in the mor@@ nings and evening , depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way the Min@@ is on dirt road , chap@@ els or churches and again re@@ ast to sing together a song from self @-@ cler@@ ical pilgri@@ m . &quot;
for the nights found the rec@@ tory of the local par@@ ishes at their disposal .
&quot; at the Et@@ app@@ hir@@ s Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty , as well as a supp@@ er dinner and breakfast . &quot;
we continued the second day about Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags on that one stepped up the stage to St. Peter , which was the hardest way , but at the beginning of sul@@ try heat , at first , some 500 meters had desc@@ ended and thereafter again . &quot;
the earned reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on the beach .
after the morning impul@@ s on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter passed it to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ book to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly facilitated and happy the min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ berg Münster , and steps up the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse we would like to thank God .
&quot; in the evening mass in the Münster , the best @-@ made min@@ is were welcomed by co@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
after the worship the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the altar .
the next day there was time for the Bre@@ e@@ gau@@ ge metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were shaped . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ ste last night in the men &apos;s team @-@ Sprint at the Vel@@ o@@ rom in Rio to glory but the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took up the anch@@ oring role , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend prou@@ dly , when he stor@@ med home to have a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed four years ago a shocking victory , while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic @-@ old@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; she reiter@@ ated the trick , after she finished in March at the Bahn @-@ World Championships in London despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys , just a modest sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did it in time as a execution .
high@@ ys retired from a gap that K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton attempted to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in which they stayed , when they saw potential in the caves , which now has un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; references , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y won - and Sk@@ inner in the qualification round a Olympi@@ ar@@ ch@@ ord , but in the still@@ s of winning the New Zealand in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap was short , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
a strategy of strategy made a great part of the transformation from which exec@@ utions carried out in a higher course to dec@@ eler@@ ate him and make it Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to hold the pace .
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when they went to the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make myself a name .
&quot; in the final phase , we have defeated a Olympi@@ ar@@ ch@@ ord and the world champion has been defeated . &quot;
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the site Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , he concluded that he fell on the train after a weak start . &quot;
he later returned this statement later and there was no objection of England rival@@ ry .
for so much victory this time there was not such a problem .
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole UK flags on the ble@@ ach@@ ers like London . &quot;
we have joined the team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which was won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if that is a bar@@ ometer on our progress over the last five months , we expect a successful five days in Vel@@ o@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the shape Kenn@@ ys , it &apos;s in the area of utmost importance that he &apos;s ho@@ ys victory of three Olympic Gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; this would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister ) were signi@@ fied with a bul@@ b of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the strug@@ gler of Ho@@ y is equal .
&quot; Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint , which begins today and will go over three days . &quot;
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lonely to win alone .
&quot; saying , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ard competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the target .
&quot; the World War , which won gold in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of the competition , at which Wig@@ gins is with certainty in focus . &quot;
he had disputed himself yesterday with Be@@ aches in front of the qualification as it smells that they were able to measure his height .
&quot; in the course of the women competition , the morning continued and finished , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archi@@ ved of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in World k@@ ord@@ era in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team is looking forward to the strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a score of medals .
after a truly exceptional presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London the expectations for Rio dropped .
&quot; while Dr@@ amas played in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the Sh@@ ane Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ment , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; but if one sees the first evening of the competition at the Vel@@ o@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation GB@@ s , who has reached its climax at the perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land on account of lifting energy consumption
&quot; the future of aluminum um@@ mel@@ tdown from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand in the game , since the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract , and thus deliver all the supply contracts , such as the growing energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies on the operation of the plant . &quot;
the Sub@@ si@@ diary set up for 20 years will run in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered at a closing time .
&quot; moreover , it could come to dom@@ ino effects since the melting away amounts around 10 percent of the total electricity generation . Vict@@ ori@@ as consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa joined the Point Henry melting shop , which led to a closure of the an@@ gler power station last year . &quot;
the melting shop of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risky a closure .
&quot; this step follows years spec@@ ulations in terms of the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the great aluminum mel@@ tdown with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with it that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , from which the Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding minor shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L goes out that the plant in Port@@ land will continue to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity by the melting form , &quot; divided the company . &quot;
AG@@ L continues to say that the agreements are so @-@ called &quot; backup transactions &quot; that would have to come into force from November 2016 onwards .
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; from that , AG@@ L expects that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will be contributing to the revenue , &quot; said the electricity supply . &quot;
all potential impact on AG@@ L from G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecasts of strong terminals for wholesale prices .
&quot; AG@@ L shared with the value of the contract already in its annual down@@ gra@@ ins of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of an cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa told that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; sm@@ as@@ uring the melting or to ensure the power supply to the melting form . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 year contract with Lo@@ y y@@ ang , who would have been in effect from November this year , even if it is yet a statement that it res@@ igned by the contract . &quot;
&quot; analy@@ st warn against the poor economic conditions of the branch before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt , Victoria and the Tom@@ ato facility near Newcastle . &quot;
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land will consume around 600 mega@@ watts and Tom@@ ago about 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both plants disappear from the market , this would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , this would not be good , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a car@@ das@@ hi@@ an Reality @-@ TV @-@ Star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ copy of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the Man@@ ag@@ erin and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner clan is located on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der and the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this co@@ ver@@ ted to wines , wrote k@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , which shows the whole car@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ k@@ els and producer of Ke@@ eping Up Ry@@ an Se@@ ac@@ rest ) and ends with a classical turn : all of them have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this presents the cl@@ is@@ che@@ al action nearly every birthday @-@ sep@@ tic in a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You suspect that we would have forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the honesty of a character set on a Sen@@ de@@ platz at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to leave their other girls somehow to this publicity . &quot;
with a view to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue has certainly started a new era of car@@ das@@ hi@@ ans .
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue Cover was concerned , ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September edition of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is for Vo@@ gue the most selling edition of the year .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more a picture @-@ band than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling stock 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his co@@ ver@@ stars is expected so long @-@ awaited , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine had to be le@@ ak@@ ed before the official announcements . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebrities , &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , the celebrities &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Jennifer Lawrence lau@@ re@@ ate Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. J@@ enner - who is described from the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ out model &quot; &quot; of their generation - falls below the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous people or Reality stars or teenagers from today who know how to rot@@ ate a good snack @-@ chat video ( even if it &apos;s true of them ) .
they are truly talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners will not succeed . &quot;
&quot; with its Reality @-@ TV story , Jen@@ ners status in the fashion world was always tense . &quot;
in June he critici@@ zed the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and their colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called it &quot; the M@@ ist@@ pieces of the moment .
these feelings aw@@ aken high when the message arrived with the appearance of Jen@@ ners on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but to ride on the mess the spot seems to go over .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all of your sisters will sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
she sold her made pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine of LOVE .
&quot; and in their free time , she is to be seen in the Reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children . &quot;
&quot; common centers point to 16@@ 0.000 people every year , &quot;
&quot; over 160@@ ,000 of the aid of the country , more than 16@@ 0.000 the aid of the country are being rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the sector focused on the impact of further mid @-@ recent transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three out of five people - mostly elderly people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no funds for injustice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; starting June next year , this legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funding . &quot;
&quot; the Director of the municipal centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said , that the last survey of the National Association of municipal centers , revealed that thousands of people are rejected every year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the resolution of the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ lands &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with uns@@ ur@@ passed and depres@@ sing debt , families , which have been dis@@ missed by parti@@ tions , workers , the un@@ just days - all these people have problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they can &apos;t get help they need . &quot;
&quot; in June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people from Queensland are forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General Federal Constitutional Court and the Federal Minister of the Federal Minister and the Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to raise the recent recent abbrevi@@ ations immediately , so that people may need the help they need in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the national government filled their commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to view the needs of the community centres and their stakeholders , and that the government is investing Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k into this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign charged with employee supposedly gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps Camp@@ a@@ ign has been indicted for alleged in@@ action , after it was communicated to her struggle manager for North Carolina in February a fire@@ arms was directed to an employee while in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident described in a indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the Local Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programming for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i had been waiting to have been servi@@ ced for months that the matter would be controlled internally before he realised that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the battle manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a p@@ istol , laid his right for@@ ef@@ inger on the de@@ duction and r@@ amm@@ ate the course in Vinc@@ ents &quot; &quot; Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le &quot; , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his charges . &quot;
&quot; having examined at the local and regional fighting line , B@@ ordin@@ i stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he gave in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment only comes after two days after the Republi@@ can presidential attacks , when he said a crowd of people in North Carolina , saying that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; - fire@@ arms and weapons of arms should take action in case his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton are elected and judges should appoint . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ umps campaign realized that the media could have demol@@ ished his words from the context , and that he would not rise to violence . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ ates complaint calls for damages from the campaign for violation of duty of duty , and Philip due to physic@@ ality and abi@@ otic damage . &quot;
Tr@@ umps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks had not been reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip likewise absent .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news station in Charlotte , announces that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries @-@ elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are considerable losses for the government officials and CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; this took representative in the opinion pol@@ ls of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black governmental coalition in the North could continue to rule in the north , this is not possible after the survey in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party , and thus would have good chance to continue the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD led by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent less than five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only just close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is between the left and the Af@@ D dispute .
&quot; the left strug@@ gled on 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would represent 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
the Greens hesit@@ ated in spite of slight losses with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) in the heav@@ y@@ days of the country .
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country .
&quot; according to the survey of the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD is estimated that only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; this puts you still behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D would represent 14 per cent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , Germany . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent the F@@ DP could hope for a return , the Pir@@ ates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Time Machine : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market .
the followers now dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the device weigh@@ ed almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
on the contrary it was quite chil@@ i .
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at the beginning of eight Meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would today extend for approximately two sel@@ fs with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in the stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euro lovers the devices can still buy the Internet , but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
but twenty years ago the communic@@ ator was a sensation .
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at the computer at CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the west @-@ west format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could send a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browsers , albeit qu@@ int@@ ingly slow . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ see and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be looked up like a laptop . &quot;
then there were a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphone in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody could guess in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the start of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
&quot; the clever phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the cell @-@ saving of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold and handled in Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , providers dominate the market today , which came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere , that is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
in 2015 there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide .
&quot; sold around 1.4 billion devices , on Samsung and Apple , dropped of around 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
the worldwide sales of these devices is approximately 400 billion euros .
this means the well @-@ running shops of the countless app @-@ providers and telecommunications companies .
around the smartphone in the meantime an entire industry was created .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market arrived at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple Chairman Steve Jobs announced at the Mac World Championship the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an internet communication , all easy to use via touch @-@ screen . &quot;
&quot; the victory of Apple began , still today the iPhone is the most important product of the Group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention a matter of course .
at the moment each German now looks back 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; we all need to learn to put the smartphone aside , &quot; &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens @-@ board for staff . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must draw the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only used in our local municipalities and all over London , but will bring renewal and prosperity in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as at that time in 2012 in London , when we run a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited by the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local people and companies near He@@ a@@ throw Airport .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already alone 10,000 new teachers to create 40,000 new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; just as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who think that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too great . &quot;
&quot; I told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will be blin@@ ded on the world stage . &quot;
the doub@@ ters had no injustice in 2012 and they will be wrong with He@@ a@@ throw as well .
there are always obstacles to overcoming but He@@ a@@ throw answers any question asked by him .
as the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw off for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is a way to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion to wit@@ ching growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and across the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion set @-@ up investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world @-@ world airport terminal , built up to the T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented trails around the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third tre@@ ad , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s London games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will be also one .
&quot; it is time for we channel this olymp@@ ic spirit and add He@@ a@@ throw , as well as creating our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocks &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with Online@@ advertising money , according to one of the software companies attempts to handle signs , a &quot; &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there was display lo@@ osen on his desktop page , Ad@@ block Plus has released a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook concluded that its Des@@ k@@ top@@ us would change the enco@@ ding for its advertisements in order to detect the detection section on which part of the page advertising is to be difficult to recognize . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that there is a new way to deal with new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle is already underway since the invention of advertisers , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has left in the fight , is a strong indication of how worrying indicators have become over the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study of the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe about 200 million people display , it &apos;s almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion daily active users access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ cam makes up to 84 percent of the advertising revenue of fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has shown it on display blocks on desktop PCs , since mobile ad blocks has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks &apos;s mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs is making sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears to be an investment in such a step as worthwhile . &quot;
on Tuesday she shared Facebook with that it would update its &quot; ad @-@ pot &quot; tool to give people more control over them .
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook announced that Ad@@ blocks would be worrying , because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users that is not a positive experience , we are planning to address the problem , &quot; shared a speaker of Facebook in an email message . &quot;
&quot; displays are a stupid means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway over@@ ride
the victim lay in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to take a woman over the early hours of the morning at a suspected suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
&quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman placed herself in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police in V@@ aud said . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a dancer at the age of 49 is that of several vehicles , including a truck , was passed , even to kill themselves . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already heard , but some have still not been identified , the police , who calls this as well as any witnesses of the incident , to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation procedures , which is a &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation , divided Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable .
in any of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the motorway - was decided that the motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedest@@ rians in the middle of the night on the highway runs as it was in the paper .
&quot; last year , a police officers was acqu@@ itted and acqu@@ itted the kill@@ ings after they had passed a man and killed that in August 2014 one night on the A1 was placed near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court noted that the poli@@ ce@@ man responded to a call -- an justified manner , and that the presence of a man on the road a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should sign up at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Climate : Venus was once hab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once ind@@ ented according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA Climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms to those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere were once raised up @-@ like conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow turn of the Venus could be explained through its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nonetheless slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of early Venus .
&quot; the planet is likely to have more dry areas than the earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and to be protected from a faster result . &quot;
the early Venus benefited also from a sun which was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation expon@@ entially the slow turn of Venus its daily side of the Sun is almost two months long , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientists Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer of clouds , which affects the surface of much of the sun heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degree cooler than that of the earth today . &quot;
the model produced a history of Venus that is similar to evolution that was previously thought of planetary research .
&quot; although it was probably supposed to be inhab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ zu@@ much heat and ultra@@ violet light was exposed . &quot;
their oceans hold dark and its water vap@@ or was blown away from the ultra @-@ violet light .
&quot; as your hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained back with a deadly greenhouse -- the Venus that we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate models in ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy goes back as a trainer in order to come back
Patrick Roy entered the Colorado mission as a trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in Colorado . he led a small self @-@ determination procedure for the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and mer@@ it that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have met my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado School with energy , passion and determination , &quot; expressed the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; over the course of the summer , I thought long and much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , this it requires and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey operations must perfectly match the organization . &quot;
he has to have a responsibility right at decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not currently met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who died on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the Best Trainer of the League .
&quot; he carried the association to 112 points and on the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten to the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the post@@ season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the description signed in the 2015 @-@ 16 @-@ 16 @-@ 4 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild card clip in the Western Conference for five points .
&quot; as a Hall of Fame Tor@@ alie , Roy four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups won -- two pieces with Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the description . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ ler resume talks on how to strike off
&quot; labour struggles with regard to compensation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ öl@@ ler will be exposed , while all dispute parties for a new round of talks were put to the table , they said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil @-@ field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally operated on platforms in the North Sea , run by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions can confirm that we have agreed , the resolution process of the current struggle , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will begin the beginning of next year to re@@ address the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is protest against possible wage levels of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has shortened this year to its contrac@@ tions in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the Council of the company follows a 10 @-@ process decline for on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has release and announced plans for his part of thousands of people and plans to surrender his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as its business activities are ration@@ alized as a result of his meg@@ at@@ re@@ ation with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which has been abandoned by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish manager Dave Anderson met with workers leaders in the beginning of this week to discuss one of the greatest wage disputes which occurred since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy which works for many , and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion will be expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of about $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation rate of stars in the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler World War has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the star cluster , the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the cluster will rot@@ ate to different rates , as well as in what regard the rotation periods with the planetary process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by the same of our results with other constell@@ ations , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the Cal@@ tech &apos;s infr@@ ing@@ Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster were founded around 125 million years ago , now the adul@@ thood now reach adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rates , these ro@@ aring stars come large quantities of star@@ ters . &quot;
since these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of stars they have a brake effect on the stars .
&quot; when a star is aged , his rotation rate begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by showing the time between the appearance of an recognizable Star@@ line -- like sun@@ spots .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars revol@@ ve more than a less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with a bigger stars of slower pi@@ rou@@ ets than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; b@@ allet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades , we see that slow rotation tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; because the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much to what we would like to know more about how , when , When and why stars dec@@ eler@@ ate their rot@@ ational rates and so to say their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ Star occurs
the tears worked faster with Alex Rodri@@ guez than the US Bas@@ eball @-@ Star in best days from base to base .
&quot; following his emotional appeal announcement , the 41 years old pro on the 12th August against the Tamp@@ a Bay R@@ ays will last one last time the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ dbye &quot; to the &quot; , &quot; the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Game @-@ participants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
three times Rodri@@ guez became the most valuable player of the League in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es .
his signature under one tenth of the year have been given 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .

&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing incidents &quot;
caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing win@@ et@@ asting A@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski out of Poland in Rio do not start .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a caught Ath@@ os would have been nearly a medal .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official accounts of the Olympic Games were well @-@ known in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ing in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these messages come to the un@@ time . &quot;
in Ch@@ en last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mas@@ king means for dop@@ ing instances .
the International Sport@@ s@@ shof CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had occupied the fourth place in the finals above 100 m butter@@ fly , only around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medals . &quot;
on Friday he would have to participate in the proceedings about 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has filed with the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) opening the opening of the B sample and a hearing .
&quot; the national association put the matter &quot; very seriously and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua , in a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Court Tribunal for CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is not responsible for the refurb@@ ishment of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio oo@@ zes the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went out into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; explained the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the EP@@ O should act with the banned substance . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample would also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov studied himself as soon as criticism of the Ath@@ os .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the sports@@ men do not drag the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; we Bul@@ gar@@ en are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; thus , for instance , all weight of weight from the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ing nation may not compete in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London Olympi@@ ad in the class until 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days before positive to the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both dispute the intake , but both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further serious blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the global association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team , except for systematic dop@@ ing to start the start , even the waste nation in Kenya has been producing numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the earlier Ver@@ sions in China had also ensured in China for fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ ad Sun Yang Li@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium more than 200 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t said in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the centre of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in 2014 at the Chinese champi@@ onships for the stimul@@ ant of Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ ine , but only had to sit down a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de acc@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ran@@ som her ran@@ som
programmers of compres@@ sing mal@@ ware currently rely on specific companies - and they are successful .
&quot; according to a current survey conducted by Mal@@ ware @-@ resistance specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes below 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of those surve@@ yed companies were killed at least once , some times a number of victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
almost 20 percent of companies in Germany were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing .
40 percent of the victims were will@@ ingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators speci@@ alise their ex@@ tor@@ ment software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to pres@@ et ran@@ som is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying fast evolution of damage software , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ Programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators discovered the re@@ pres@@ sors software for itself .
&quot; first of all , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred quickly in the last months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once active on the computer of a victim , it looks for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files , as well as to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encrypted the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als in a sustainable manner .
then the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the end @-@ key code to the files , the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ bac@@ on Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where in private use the personal photo database is at stake , it comes with companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is imp@@ lied . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls off if a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German firms affected sales losses by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to completely inter@@ rupt the business activities , in case of a case humans were in danger . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , many more hospitals were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health insurance . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies , pay , get their data back . &quot;
&quot; for managers it is difficult , in view of stagnation in the operation the demand of the perpetrators . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure examined the utility space and contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their sacrifices by chat , as you can pay by Bit@@ coin , strai@@ ghten freely accessible support sites or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and are res@@ cu@@ ers after payments of few hundred Euros , companies need to pay heavily on hard and five @-@ digit sums in order to redeem their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ kl@@ ess profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ ackers are always professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus provider Sop@@ rano : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , however , is that it is three or four people . &quot;
the programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits have been acquired by the mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , solid price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included is a custom@@ ization tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail are then looking for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the newly purchased software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums in the underground , buy the set of a criminal and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per ann@@ on@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually instruc@@ t the crime then sp@@ ammer with the spread &quot; , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; by now , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that make their data better secure . &quot;
&quot; over 50 percent of the firms @-@ IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey trust in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey , to aver@@ t Ran@@ som@@ ware to rep@@ el with file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful adoption , the perpetrators are contrary to publication of sensitive data such as customer &apos;s lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential is higher than before . depending on the type of data , the damage potential is higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the do@@ ers may continue to take completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrated the safety researchers as they could get together with the Internet connecting thermo@@ stat under their control .
in the middle of winter the cas@@ h@@ is@@ tion of such a blocked heating system could certainly be worth a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the do@@ ers then rather block the heating in the future a whole manufacturing way in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware might also be a subject in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ shaped .
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V works small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls into something . &quot;
versatile and comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; it is not only a trunk @-@ room of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ rate and 10@@ 26 l rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seat areas of the back@@ seat can be so@@ wn out like Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high from the ground up to the blankets 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk @-@ trunk can be easily loaded , however the charger with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide @-@ speed ranges very powerful . &quot;
he should however do something qui@@ eter on his work .
encouraging is the daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another motor@@ ization : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
&quot; the facilities in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; for safety systems , the City of Not@@ at@@ ms@@ king &apos;s assistant ( works up to pace 32 ) , the collision maintenance system and the sp@@ aci@@ dity assistant . &quot;
&quot; the coll@@ isions war@@ ner sometimes irrit@@ ated sometimes , because he evaluated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ah@@ ing objects . &quot; &quot;
very reliable works of the tel@@ escope .
and the intelligent Tem@@ por@@ ridge respon@@ ds to the traffic @-@ detection and th@@ rot@@ ated when required the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top facilities : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore something awk@@ ward .
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel is fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , gets the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro to the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 @-@ emission standard .

Air@@ line is not liable : over@@ throwing on passenger &apos;s bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s bridge .
&quot; liability is only conceivable for dangers that are typical of air traffic , argued the Supreme Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down in the fall of a knee defence .
&quot; however , the accident could have ever happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the organizer
sick holiday@@ makers get money back after their journey only money if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel .
&quot; this is only the case , if more than ten per cent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in that case , a family was severely ill to diar@@ rhea and vom@@ iting in the second day of their door . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
your illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that pur@@ ged the sea@@ water .
&quot; the family was the view , the journey was so fla@@ wed - and mour@@ ned for the organizer . &quot;
in court the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the se@@ wage plant was in fact faul@@ ty .
but the promot@@ ers arrived only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to assume until then that the sea water was fine .
&quot; so he has not violated his information duties , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contam@@ in@@ ants were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with one another - belonging to the general life risks .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were sick .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violence perpetr@@ ated by the refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be n@@ uns and determined at the same time responding to terrorist acts .
&quot; sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph will not give the terrorists a treat . &quot;
&quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , the level of safety and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the federal election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ alisation of security forces , namely in medium @-@ sized order for several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism should again be under punishment .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the ceas@@ e@@ fire can be calculated so that especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is complicated . &quot;
the last much discussed silence for doctors should remain accountable to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the care af@@ lo@@ af@@ t , he wants to seek solutions as the threat of citizens could be reduced , he said with a view of the psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers greater social support to be necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed human beings .
&quot; for the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère planning the use of an international investigation . &quot;
&quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to improving security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister said clearly against shareholders . &quot;
&quot; that was an ear @-@ on for the hing@@ es in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the union after an Bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ishing the double nationality .
a general ban on completion of the disease can be un@@ constitutional .
&quot; one cannot ban it all , which one ref@@ uses , and I rest the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green head boss , Simone Peter threw the Minister before , he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror package . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party of the Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet explo@@ iters and a ti@@ ghtening of common dwelling on the right bring people in this country no longer safety . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the motorway exit
it is regularly on the junction road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
yet this should change : the legal vacuum is to be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who stand in the traffic road every night in the traffic road when they travel across the highway A@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
road construction will extend the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the departure of Wes@@ el Street the right track to 700 meters .
motor@@ cyclists can then go directly from the hammer road on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : traffic will take early , thus increasing the overall process on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West .
the drivers on the Zu@@ br@@ inger rolls the drivers before all between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
on week@@ days the back@@ bone extends as far as to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ west road and sometimes also beyond .
&quot; reason , the needle is on the B 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ el Street . &quot;
from here the traffic is guided only one lane on the bridge bridge .
the second track had to become more than a quarter @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had revealed that the bridge is no longer the required force , in order to especially absorb the heavy @-@ duty traffic . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related trade fair will last , the local country is unable to say . &quot;
&quot; however , with years to calculate : for the bridge has an official balance of balance up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal environment , the national enterprise has chosen the busi@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities will be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be guided on Tuesday and Wednesday at the job@@ site .
intercultural travel : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the Theat@@ res &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the Association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre now plan a music project .
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with a migration and a refugee background , cultural institutions in Münster , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ ima &apos;s initi@@ alled &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; , &quot; 19 students between eleven and 15 years attended the staging of the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , who has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , schools with welcome classes , will be able to visit cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people of the class came from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the cens@@ orious pictures and video animations did it have been possible to follow the course of action , thus follow the press release of the boy Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg , and the young theatre will work together as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years are to be given the opportunity to visit professionally in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal Language Education are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increasing refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ring : hope to improve the weather
the weather has made the star sn@@ ap Gu@@ ck@@ ers in the southwest of Germany at night for Friday a line by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain , bad for it to watch the cel@@ estial spectacle , said the chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many ast@@ er@@ ors in the sky . &quot;
&quot; in the observatory , it is per@@ rop@@ es , which belong to the fastest star @-@ car@@ ps with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their names , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes down in the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one stands forever , at night one is awake in hours , in the morning there is no more to think of sleep . &quot;
this is all but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch @-@ Institute , about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders , and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently completely recovered . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleeping distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many different causes underlying them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ ar , Member of the German Society for Sle@@ eving and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one does not understand , is however the in@@ som@@ nia , so an inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y disorder . &quot;
&quot; just to sleep sound@@ ing many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member in the German household association with practice in Dutch Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep @-@ distur@@ ban@@ ces ?
the causes of sleeping disorders are complex .
&quot; it can be organic , mental or low @-@ related factors , but also drugs . &quot;
not rarely is the sleeping @-@ disorder expression of a different disorder .
&quot; very early waking up is mostly in depression often , &quot; says We@@ get . &quot;
and it can be that different factors thank each other .
&quot; who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , wake all two to three hours and begins to greet you on day @-@ to @-@ day problems and problems , there is a example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one doctor to the doctor with sleeping disorders ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week , and the day is imp@@ aired , should go to the doctor , betra@@ y We@@ get . &quot;
&quot; draw@@ back can look quite different : it is un@@ beaten , tired , un@@ exhausted , difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or bodily ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the sleeping disorder , it is important to find their causes . &quot;
&quot; as a treatment options , among other things , behavi@@ oral changes occur , a cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping @-@ coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , there is hardly involved in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary dormit@@ ories of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore one should contact the care physician first for sleeping problems , &quot;
the study can be resolved if the problems have a physical cause .
who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens ?
&quot; for instance , to study in the sleep laboratory there is an example with snoring with respiratory suffer@@ ings , in case of disease @-@ fatigue or if one is not found the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder . &quot;
this is actually not necessary to prepare for the study .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the c@@ abling you go to bed at its normal time .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e on the finger . &quot;
&quot; moreover , a camera draws at the ceiling of the sleeping place . &quot;
how can people cope with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adju@@ sting screws where you can sit for a better sleep .
&quot; weather counts : regular sleeping and standing @-@ times , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep too long in bed , do not watch television to sleep , alcohol , and at night not look at the clock - then you start to calculate immediately , and that is quite and not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

airport : bonds of baggage
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; on Thursday , the police officers met the arrest of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years . &quot;
the Tat@@ se@@ duc@@ ts had committed itself as ban@@ de several hand@@ ker@@ - and pan@@ nier steel .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 pm , civilian officials realized in the area of the airport Dus@@ seldorf a bank again , which was known to poli@@ c@@ emen from past theft . &quot;
the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid July and were involved in a collaborative and particularly professional .
&quot; the experts of the Cri@@ mean Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can have traveled the th@@ iev@@ es , which were comm@@ itting to the crimes of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; they had a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lenses bub@@ bles , in between even the rest of the cob@@ bled patches : the Riga road in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in seems at first glance not so , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one walks along the road from east to west , one gets past play@@ grounds , a fresh@@ est kinder@@ garten and a be@@ et . &quot;
on the façade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; sc@@ anned .
&quot; opposite from a Li@@ d@@ l who shall soon be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy &quot; district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in calls , however , in recent weeks , however , preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the main reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , now the residents have been hiring , but on the ground floor there are still spaces occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; particularly at the beginning of the year , Hen@@ kel had repeatedly called for a hard approach to the police against the project , the region as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms were ev@@ acu@@ ated on the ground floor , the car@@ d@@ smith , with 300 police officials , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks ago , pat@@ rolling parts of the road and kept visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
currency of the newly established building workers on behalf of the non @-@ known home@@ owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative tribunal decided that the clearance was illegal , and a day later forced police and builders under the rejo@@ icing of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents go walking with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about pro@@ m sp@@ ig@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there are elementary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; left force is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * who produces three children here mainly from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of the house projects they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and cent@@ ri@@ fication .
&quot; it does not sound like a pine , who is mostly losing police protection from v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left . &quot;
&quot; the dit@@ ch , which the Berlin interior and the police arise between domestic and their neighbors , does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a low average income today , compared to the rest of the city , and has a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; home@@ grown @-@ occupied projects and the resulting housing projects are long lived to Kiev : 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly all the Main@@ zer road very close to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer has been cleared under a great street in a down@@ right street , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga , partly still occupied by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly the magnet for tourists and suff@@ oc@@ liner from all over the world : they now share their inhabitants from the GDR &apos;s times and former houses . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has risen almost 60 per cent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the newly built buildings in the Rig@@ s are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in drawn sli@@ ces , or freshly made fac@@ ades , which were cast with color . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year as often together with the words &quot; &quot; lef@@ aut@@ on@@ ome violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason for not all neighbours see this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : criminal off@@ ences such as physic@@ ists are directed almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the biggest part of the criminal off@@ ences make matters , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a lease next to the controversial 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; regarding violence , it is cruel : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have certainly not been . &quot;
the famous burning cars also give it to the Riga already no longer .
&quot; for the studied architec@@ tin , its street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives together on the street and gets more each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has moved into the Riga road - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was so important that the inhabitants received their streets : from the police , politics and the media , all of which suddenly claimed the interpretation of the city in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants , as new@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away : by spot@@ lessly new buildings in former buildings , which pushed the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ um apartments , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not so good , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I do not wait . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never listen to ?
&quot; there is frustration at all sides , even with the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for acc@@ ol@@ lec@@ tions , who loves themselves about color bombs , Ker@@ stin has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene were to Kiev . &quot;
&quot; who comes from , should be aware of this - just like someone who moves to a pub like a pub that can complain bad about noise . &quot;
all persons who have imagined are asked to be called not with their correct name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , she is a social worker on site . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the refugee agency for Ur@@ bach .
the social educational institute supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , working group refugee , administration , authorities and who else else goes along . &quot;
&quot; reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the egg @-@ reli@@ ed wool @-@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cked and rather focused on a wide variety of tasks , meaning that the administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; searched for was a Board of Directors with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in social work , just a long @-@ reli@@ eved W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; however , administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; it is above all about organization , work with local people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old have been with it for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position for the period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le hon@@ e- and full @-@ time actors support . &quot;
&quot; there are large and minor problems , organisational , human and distribution issues . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the washing road
&quot; a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for the inter@@ connection lines that have been acknowledged . &quot;
the commun@@ es are responsible for the connection .
you must locate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises .
&quot; the costs for the building , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Land@@ scap@@ ego@@ at and job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been designed for some time as very difficult .
in fact the administration is not found private apartments .
&quot; do not work so far , be dependent on private apartments , so deu@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be loc@@ ating , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing road .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed lead , it is practi@@ sing places , training places , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that need to be f@@ and@@ ment or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ work , do well @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very neat , like Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes that work will lead to a positive external effect .
&quot; that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it does not only mean work . &quot;
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say deu@@ ces and client . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of concern .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with natives and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so we also jump to administration and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time to bridge , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling , he could no help in Ur@@ bach nobody , do not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never be integrated . &quot;
the distinct majority was motivated .
&quot; however , problem occurs , however , says customer honestly , &quot; people , in which nothing goes . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer therefore is always to motivate others to motivate them . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two after the recent occurr@@ ences of fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what man@@ holes can call naive . &quot; a Res@@ dre@@ am@@ ko can and would not shut it out . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ zed are the hel@@ per but already .
these incidents were also subject to the refugees .
they could have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into dis@@ call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with that , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would happily stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary work must be held in place and in the region to activities .
they always have in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy is h@@ ein@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them on @-@ site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like &quot; , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bach are already busy at the time , to make up the present people reasonable . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , since there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : In@@ bre@@ cher with helicop@@ ters sought
the police @-@ helicopter flew different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two UFO men are rolled into an apartment in an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the lin@@ den@@ way .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the un@@ hol@@ ids into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1,@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ hed , bore both Blue@@ jeans and black Kap@@ u@@ zen@@ pul@@ lis . &quot;
you p@@ oul@@ ted towards the city center .
&quot; to the cap@@ tion , the police put several stri@@ ps and a police @-@ helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
&quot; eventually , the unkno@@ wns were in fact close to the apartment or during their flight . &quot;
