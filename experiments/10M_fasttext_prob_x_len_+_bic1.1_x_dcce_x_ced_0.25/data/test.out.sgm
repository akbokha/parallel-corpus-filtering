<seg id="11">"he allowed himself to lead his family over the plant of ALRV on a horse, he didn't even try to use a photo for himself."</seg>
<seg id="12">The first time in Aachen and thus also with CHIO.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clin's and Trumps Policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - this is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential elections are however in case of tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">Differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, more philosophical difference. "</seg>
<seg id="5">The state about the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubt smaller in doubt and warns that how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">Clinton wants to assert the economy to death and adjust to death he says.</seg>
<seg id="8">"on the other hand, he himself would be quite different, claims Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively withdraw the regulations, and he makes for a wide-ranging tax reform with lower tax sets strongly - for private individuals and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain duties to fulfil, he has disadvantaged odds and needs to make money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes for the rich would increase, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"to be invested in the need, Trump and Clinton say close."</seg>
<seg id="14">Democratic Candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly rejected by the stateless Teaparty-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Trump, there are still party internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">Significant are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal fired power stations and drive the coal mining in the US again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil promotion should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to expand the renewable energy with its investment programme and asks:" a country will create the superpower of clean energy and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in the infrastructure - even at international trade agreements both competitors are not too far away from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"PP, the transpazific trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the US would not want to isolate the US from international trade but simply protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid even better then calls for about Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to renter, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the large discussion of the coming months should probably be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand Trump is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him before, that the budget deficit would be just bigger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich, wants to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is one of women who fled alone, almost certainly in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">If they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby who is at the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid their little son in my arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curious with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother goes straight to the tabletop.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notes that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">It smiles short and kissing the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene appears normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a sponsor for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the theme of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are afraid.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in Munich in one of the few decentralised accommodations for omnivaded women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and Munich's Women's Aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">"men, there is no - also not as a visitor."</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: any woman who arrives here has made experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as a hopelessness to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, there are many reasons for the run:" many steal themselves secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, compulsion, honorary morbid, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act is not uncommon," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end is, once they anchor in Germany, irre, tells us."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in this case, women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worse."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this led to some 90 percent of women who live in the housing in Munich's north, traumatized it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary." ""</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so accustomed to say that they don't say anything.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experienced, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often do not cure themselves, more accommodations are needed only for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven District governments are responsible for the housing of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question, whether they knew of a similar project like in Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken there is such a thing in the housing of the governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, women are not housed alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesperson of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Mittelbaden, there are some common shelters or separate houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study which was published for the Committee, it says," It is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lacking privacy, or are being housed in both men and women, it may be - continual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"the washing rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel in need of this protection, it is possible to read the urge to go to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around, we have a long queues," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsides"?</seg>
<seg id="2">"it was a gesture, which ended a crisis."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, in order to give their hands and to preach an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterparts in the golden hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I cannot repel the expression that Ankara wants to achieve this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's grasped slipple, and he radiated hardly any heat, even for his cautious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, however, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even further improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have heard, as if never something happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">For me his enthusiasm seemed to indicate the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the President of Russia had nothing forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first to say what he mentioned in his administration: the depreciation of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was wutentbranched.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to have fallen into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The trial was even bigger than it was committed by a alleged friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media conducted a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks would blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most of the most serious officers were the accusations from leaders that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trading in Syria would have been controlled by the so-called" "Islamic state". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received Erdogan from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan needs first and foremost all the friends he can get after the last month at a failed coup d "état almost from his reign.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions hit Turkey tough - especially the ban on charter flights that usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They are counting on a late seasonal attack at the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television sets cheaper than fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agri-imported goods are allowed to be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vezsti portrayed it as follows:" "tourists staying there, tomatoes there long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is furious to the West, because it's a reaction to the tried-to-see power as a weak answer."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent Groll about the snowy of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the oppike is to pull off the cool spirit and reduce the relation to Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"" "the Russian leader in Ankara won a bonus in Ankara that he requested support for the elected government institutions after the attempted coup."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-noticed for Moscow, which itself has a profound fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea makes it possible to present Russia and Turkey, as a analyst once described me," "alliance of external side" ": two countries that are chased and badly affected by the West and now ignite themselves."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after nearly three hours of initial discussions both presidents at the press conference, they said that they had not even striped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey dealered it on a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found to Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open enmity of hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect discord, as NATO member of Turkey the Russian martial jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State had at least talk to each other."</seg>

<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with Ivanov asked that Ivanov has asked for his post and had advised Vaino as its successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convincing the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov has long been one of the closest conspirators of Vladimir Putin and works like it for the Soviet secret service to the KGB.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief Executive, he was one of the most powerful men of the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, broadcast on TV broadcasted, both men claimed that the chief's chief claim their own desire."</seg>

<seg id="19">"thus, here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?"</seg>

<seg id="21">"however, the official statement - that a man who once claimed as a potential president, would once forward the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his comments to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turned out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin got into power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could become president of Russia as a third term of Putin had violated the Constitution.</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post has been taken by another, near ally Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin has become prime minister before he was appointed president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="7">A regulation is lacking so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who want to build on urban areas must show 20 percent of all the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be included in the inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but the major dispute settlement in the town hall is, however, as Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors in order to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to rely on such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 percent of the apartments are building as social housing."</seg>

<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the specialists.</seg>
<seg id="20">"yet the program is not complete, because the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how is the loss of further around 1300-priced apartments, whose promotion will be expired in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">Only by 2020 alone will be 500 apartments.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, as planned policy spokesperson in Nicole Palm, should now be bought out-running ties from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it needs to be thought to bring apartments back into the price of price."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the Western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">To one fell swoop to solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the Western city, for the end of the year, dates back to the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could get there back in the price of affordable housing."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: that do not want the owners, the housing companies do not."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after all, the number of social housing in the Western city increases again drastically by the purpose of so-called" intermingling. ""</seg>

<seg id="2">It's fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"that teenagers and child are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time working on screens; in the last decade of many complained."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active.</seg>

<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>

<seg id="8">"as many phenomena of pop culture declined from the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overlap the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder, and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, the players come out with their smartphones to the outside and look for Pokémons to follow-up using a GPS once they have been found" "photographed" "(over a screenshot on the phone) or" "captured". ""</seg>

<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it just sees the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health, people want to bring about" 30 minutes "to get" "from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day", "because many public messages are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>

<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces its chances to become ill to cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outside that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus, three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even join the hunt even new friendships.</seg>
<seg id="24">As always there is also murky playing spober that always have to complain about something.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is meant to be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps were able to trace our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and make use of time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, because of Pokemons's success there will be more games that will unite the apps and virtual reality with the activism in the real world and be able to help many people in the hunt, active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="14">She broke out in tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at this moment found an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success shows them in the same league as unique athletes, such as Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals get nothing of the summer campaign to vote - and the vacationers from North Rhine-Westphalia should not choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2005, the urban election will not be held right at the end of the summer holidays, the heavencampine Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after so far, it does not go: summer holidays, heat and land-swamps - this is sweeping."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the electoral campaigners, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most holidaymakers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not natives, so they are not allowed to choose the country's day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"these come practical problems: during the holidays are helpers to hang the posters, air balloon, flyers and end up in the end voices are just laborious back."</seg>
<seg id="9">"by the 4th of September 2016, the electoral and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to be gone over by the people of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it is also about something: Prime Minister Erwin celering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, since 1998 the highest party, is now clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalitionable difference.</seg>
<seg id="14">"celering, 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from its big platen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through land, distributed Roses and chatting a little with the people, as it did already be his legendary-known predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>

<seg id="17">"your refugee policy, you" We create the "have accelerated the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably be the pleasure for him now."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top grade data, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the wrong time at the right place of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited her chancellor Angela Merkel to large-minded society; Merkel parliament aggravate-circle is in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group was not, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and Western Pomerania."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other Länder," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in the NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but there is too bad no one to hear from other corners of Germany, once Angela Merkel."</seg>

<seg id="28">"because a lot is at stake, celering has now called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats recently put forward with 22 percent behind partner CDU (25) and just just before the Afales (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"during the election of 2011, the SPD had still very clear with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were partly considerable complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bacherstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafrachstrasse and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many Schleichkatze sought and rather their Navi trusted than the signage."</seg>

<seg id="15">"therefore the speed limit has not been met, the community has increasingly called the brass vehicle from Mössing."</seg>

<seg id="25">"and in some points - in the unequal treatment of thought, for example, the question arises: what does this actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men love middle ages love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before reaching a comment, in order to sow him under the pseudonym non-Alleveling men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the soundproofing of records does not want to see on a boom in millennials who want to welcome the unity of physical objects, but to Midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased one record are all forecast after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes through hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older collectors reserve their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend alone time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you agree with the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera, while in the middle of a busy street in Soho run, before I steal, keep my hands and say something certain of that: so, let us take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos is slowly on its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there still are a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops, trying to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men aged aged) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, probably around the 20) follow, is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have around 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed by him), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford, when they had appeared and once again to buy objects that he sold when he was young and bankrupt."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are from the late sixties, early 70ies which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I was probably something too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy plates, are more introverted and like to spend alone time, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink very much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my push.</seg>
<seg id="22">"CONZ, 25 who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who have been influenced by the media, people who have heard about the comeback and can be seen to get back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I managed, people normally get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to get back their records", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like phonica to realize that record stores offers a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the non-contact payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some plate-fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to rectangle about the stability of familiar sound cases, of objects that wakeup with the happy Yugoslav innings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it may be a filling of a void or the possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it's like that with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" flutes a staff from a record stack. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people, who bought last month a record, they have not heard yet."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% possess a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned while I swaying a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged) has noticed a" trophy "of the revals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came only recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radiohead record, so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">This is not a large percentage but it will definitely happen.</seg>
<seg id="41">More Productless, less musiklash. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who can only get slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"over that the sound plates has almost a whole floor, has a pale crowd when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizers and sexturbo pop, instead of experimental jazz - it is good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees sonly lonely, but wet-mental traumas is hard to set if you stand next to someone 30 seconds long."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for some minutes in business and considers the varieteness of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to make a showcase than a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collector of plates is not a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from one computer or in another way but the beauty of records is... it drives off with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban outfit."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the sembling the jeans Hotspot to musts, I observed a group of young teenager, grouped up for a moment to buy polaroid cameras before a father and daughter think to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody sees it at - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to grip them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these objects could mean more money for the sector, and some buyers could send in the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it's no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, the one that is most for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research results apply that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record business and in online foren."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the betrotter through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaf through plates, while they steer the rigid glance of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator that overlooks the shoulders of middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Mind, Health: singing doing senior"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has URSEL Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, in the magisterium and today she sings the Fach music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a Seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"they sing me - emotional and physically," "describes them."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a sample she feels balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">She is doing something good for her health and spirit.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for singing is right from several perspectives an amazing hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German seniors."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing along the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">By regular contraction you can build and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"since frequently, social and family structures arise at age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made URSEL Kipp in her choir: to speak and organize, to rely on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in a positive sense means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"whoever asks his lungs regularly, does not work as fast in everyday life as soon as the Puste."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, Singen often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the federal labor community of senior organizations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the joint Singen had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observed that singing or hearing of songs when elderly people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">By Liedlyte and especially melodies arise themselves and crushed people in a long history.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head is also required for a particular achievement, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">To concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people who live alone, exercise not only to focus on himself."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows by the singing in chorus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I be long for something, I'll be better and more vigilant about me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate - even if he says, have little talent, betrays Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you never sings alone - with 50 sinful men who hear, if a sound is next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">In search of the suitable offer seniors have different possibilities; says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="30">"sings from the familiar-circle in a old recenchyma, one can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Anyone who wants to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the Church as a church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who has no access to the Internet, may ask the family, friends or neighbours to help with the intervention."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who desire to sing, should be connected to a choir, betrays Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="10">"the news and the outrage were widespread in Wednesday, with reports from The verge and motherboard, a day after Snapchat weaped that it would have turned the feature."</seg>

<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be complemented by detailed knowledge during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of CentCom reports are underway, by the General Inspector of the Defense Department."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings with some of the conclusions of Republican Task Force.</seg>

<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first platformer will go to a little longer from the way that the other group will lead.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game might start on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising host by their success story, four years after they landed over the past London Games in the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey sleeping in hands (her two older sisters played the sport on the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the National player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympiad in 2008 because they could not qualify for the cadres.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the year 2012 came in which for her and her team everything went wrong.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the subsequent year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, Trainer of the National Team, and with it began to turn things for better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not work in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have the rest of the rest to snatch them.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday night Bam opened the scorching in the first half of the game with a backlash out of the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and kept the playing field from 1-0 to the third quarter, until Bam took their hands into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"he conducted a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved into the middle and invited the ball to the gate to give the American female a 2-0 leadership."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">As well as Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"among the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, there are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly changing and inescapable, a rapid season of competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It's as if the Olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stab that is from the bracelet to the swimmer to the trimmer.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can not switch off the TV to read a newspaper or listen to your neighbours in the queue in the shop, without Simone Biles, Katie Leon or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman's warm with dimples, could quite have been among these known names that could be sent to Prime Time, by sponsors and well-feel TV commercials, if he would be a swimmer, turner or even feeder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not illuminate any event immediately.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports that are not universally acknowledged: airbrush, chery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast swimming and may rule it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should humble arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000, when it had debut in Sydney, it was noticed the last 16 years so much that many people I asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasporttype."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the U.S. sent athletes to the competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had one athlete until 2012, who made it to final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians who share the women's wives.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outer layer, partly because it sounds for the unexplored ear passender for a clownsschool than that sounds for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a dedicated enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartooneness of his never to end cloudy of the pralls - but also the Grazie of the sneaker and diving, the two sports that essentially unites."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as the springboard."</seg>
<seg id="22">Emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline so shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling moves (rotating, pike and saltos) before they land at the feet. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympiad, you will be evaluated by means of execution, difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"doubling athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic Vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists hoping to continue in their quest for gold, faster, upward and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes up and back, upwards and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"it is not only hunting for the accordion, but in the television transmission, but also another height of the world: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-oriented pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I find yourself when looking at these games as something tiring.</seg>
<seg id="30">Of this the trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward-forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, apparently weightless as an astronaut, continues upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; which the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC is expelled the Endras as part of a afternoon-bloc of 2 days from 2.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the awareness of consciousness can only be achieved by the anxiety and the object tification of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal recently predicted - then Mr Dooley is expecting his breath, new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators are calling for political changes in Ethiopia as to violent resistance to the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that seventy-protesting while clashes with the police have been killed.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to break together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid foally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded in ever more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the response of the government was unmerciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses said that policemen were shot in unarmed protesters and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"moving videos across the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, showing how to hit young people with staves, while these were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The boss of the UN Authority for Human Rights is now calling for an initial investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country and in the future it will become even more difficult," "Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group."</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa and its stability is cherished by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at the respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">His infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led the oppression of the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, with dissidents effectively transferred to the silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent to exile or in prison or driven to the expanses of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But this could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and do not have any other options except to protest, it breaks off," said Seyoum Teshome, an instructor in central Ethiopies. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the bottom-up to the stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a continuing election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the final seat of the Opposition, and now control 100 percent of the parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions rise along the border to Eritrea; a battle for this zag, controversial line called for June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogades that were more or less forced in recent years to benefit the turbulence.</seg>
<seg id="29">"several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years of provocation, under the surface now explode."</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with social media, as cheap smartphones have become more frequently and improved the Internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government starts access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially during protests, many people still can communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians said they were so too protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come into mainly Christian highlands, the politics and the economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and living in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing straight.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray who dominated by about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in military, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death on a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly engaged in use early signs of discontent and use special officers to deal with opponents and make them unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime is lacking in this basic skill," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected from relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of North Ethiopian, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the South."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the Tigray controlled safety services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia had such a rebellion, in 2005, after thousands against elections promoned, according to statements by analyst seemingly fuelled by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following sweeps were killed many protesters, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts, Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure, as well as the new commuter train, as well as for its measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormality of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protested in Gondar, an amharical city, of Tigray-operated shops and the hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts are saying that the protests supported the US and other Western allies in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronym to the neighboring Somalia, even though she recently opened, that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"as the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally collapsing in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr Abdi," "is a very thin ridge."</seg>

<seg id="17">But I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough so that they can be interpreted in various ways.</seg>

<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensifying a focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign, Mr. TrumpScherze has brought his loyal co-forces into the unpleasant situation to stand to him regardless of how provocant his statements may also be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of Trumps prominent intercessors, gave great effort to defend the candidates in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," said Mr. Giuliani, so he was asked for the accuracy of Mr. Trumps statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had established the Islamic state. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Barack ISIS was an almost unknown, small organisation, he called them hind, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vortex is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Grönlandhaie usually come only in winter to surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">It was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"painted swims of the Greenland-shark along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average exactly 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, accelerates the five meters long animal on satte 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a rob."</seg>
<seg id="9">This one of long-known lifestyle does seem to be a silver bullet for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the professional journal" Science "in any case from a Greenland-shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist already noted long, that Greenland-hastoneage are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only misguided the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to watch, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea before the skinned coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear on the surface usually only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"according to the lifestyle of the Greenland-haie researchers, researchers know accordingly little."</seg>
<seg id="17">Your time pentempt Make it when they saved six animals before Svalbard around six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, this sharks make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a rob, another had slain the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly they hunt sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek carcasses, which are from higher water layers to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 before Greenland or Spitsbergen as a passenger from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetres was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed the linsinks of sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is already born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsenker.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth was therefore, after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons attempt to drag greater quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in which with 220 centimeters length of the smallest animal, the liners contained a low surplus to carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all the larger Greenland-haie had become normal carbon-14 in their liners, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock for a 493 centimeters long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark will be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark-females only then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"due to one of the animals with 392 centimeters at ease along the cusp to sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, Greenland-haie with the multiplication obviously leave at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Also this is likely to be world-chord for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusalves live above all in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose bacon at the neck a 120 years old Harpoon's tip was caught before Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism is often running on a scale of the animals living there."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature a bit later - and then slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to warm up in the cold water, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"for the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal buffers heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much bigger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is thus able to live more dangerous and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible," explains the theory of evolution. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"in contrast, a very big animal should invest his resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Venus was probably once indented according to the projections of a new NASA Climate model.</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere were once raised up-like conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow turn of the Venus could be explained through its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and nonetheless slowly revolved."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet is likely to have more dry areas than the earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and to be protected from a faster result."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited also from a sun which was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation exponentially the slow turn of Venus its daily side of the Sun is almost two months long," explained GISS scientists Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer of clouds, which affects the surface of much of the sun heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degree cooler than that of the earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that is similar to evolution that was previously thought of planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was probably supposed to be inhabitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --zumuch heat and ultraviolet light was exposed."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans hold dark and its water vapor was blown away from the ultra-violet light.</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of compressing malware currently rely on specific companies - and they are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a current survey conducted by Malware-resistance specialists Malwarebytes below 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of those surveyed companies were killed at least once, some times a number of victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">Almost 20 percent of companies in Germany were already the target of a ransomware blackmailing.</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims were willingly prepared by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialise their extorment software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to preset ransom is significantly higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying fast evolution of damage software," says Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most MalwarePrograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered the repressors software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"first of all, private users were the target, but the change to company attacks occurred quickly in the last months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works after a simple pattern: once active on the computer of a victim, it looks for unlong changed files such as Word-, Excel- or database files, as well as to archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypted the ransomware and deletes the originals in a sustainable manner.</seg>
<seg id="14">Then the software presents the demands of the blackmail.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end-key code to the files, the victims need money - mostly in the form of cryptobacon Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where in private use the personal photo database is at stake, it comes with companies for sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is implied."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls off if a ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German firms affected sales losses by ransomware, 13 per cent even had to completely interrupt the business activities, in case of a case humans were in danger."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, many more hospitals were victims of attacks, whose patients may be threatened by the loss of health insurance."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we say the victims always: pays not, you only promotes the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies, pay, get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers it is difficult, in view of stagnation in the operation the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure examined the utility space and contact with the blackmailers and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifices by chat, as you can pay by Bitcoin, straighten freely accessible support sites or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and are rescuers after payments of few hundred Euros, companies need to pay heavily on hard and five-digit sums in order to redeem their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively riskless profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hackers are always professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus provider Soprano:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, however, is that it is three or four people."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software building to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one stands forever, at night one is awake in hours, in the morning there is no more to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is with such problems in good company: according to the Robert Koch-Institute, about a quarter of adult sleeping disorders, and over ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently completely recovered."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleeping disorders, and there are many different causes underlying them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Wear, Member of the German Society for Sleeving and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one does not understand, is however the insomnia, so an inhalation and sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just to sleep sounding many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German household association with practice in Dutch Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep-disturbances?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleeping disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"it can be organic, mental or low-related factors, but also drugs."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rarely is the sleeping-disorder expression of a different disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early waking up is mostly in depression often," says Weget. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors thank each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who for example has a slipped disk, can be bad, wake all two to three hours and begins to greet you on day-to-day problems and problems, there is a example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one doctor to the doctor with sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month at least three nights per week, and the day is impaired, should go to the doctor, betray Weget."</seg>
<seg id="19">"drawback can look quite different: it is unbeaten, tired, unexhausted, difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or bodily ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the sleeping disorder, it is important to find their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as a treatment options, among other things, behavioral changes occur, a cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classical sleeping-coated tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, there is hardly involved in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary dormitories of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore one should contact the care physician first for sleeping problems,"</seg>
<seg id="24">The study can be resolved if the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">Who should go to sleep laboratory and what happens?</seg>
<seg id="26">"for instance, to study in the sleep laboratory there is an example with snoring with respiratory sufferings, in case of disease-fatigue or if one is not found the cause of a sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="27">This is actually not necessary to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling you go to bed at its normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a antennae on the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"moreover, a camera draws at the ceiling of the sleeping place."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people cope with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws where you can sit for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weather counts: regular sleeping and standing-times, not too long in bed, don't sleep too long in bed, do not watch television to sleep, alcohol, and at night not look at the clock - then you start to calculate immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="7">"regine client of the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that deuschle is now there, the egg-relied wool-sau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"so, some - less mocked and rather focused on a wide variety of tasks, meaning that the administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for was a Board of Directors with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in social work, just a long-relieved Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"it is above all about organization, work with local people on site and also behind the scenes and network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old have been with it for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position for the period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," "says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle hone- and full-time actors support."</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and minor problems, organisational, human and distribution issues."</seg>
<seg id="16">New containers are soon available in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for the interconnection lines that have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">The communes are responsible for the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must locate the refugees in their own or rented residential premises.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the building, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Landscapegoat and jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been designed for some time as very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="24">In fact the administration is not found private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"do not work so far, be dependent on private apartments, so deuces."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be locating, as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed lead, it is practising places, training places, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants that need to be fandment or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homework, do well-profit work - and that motivates and very neat, like Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that work will lead to a positive external effect.</seg>
<seg id="34">"that is" no employment therapy. "" "</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, it does not only mean work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day need a fixed structure, say deuces and client."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of concern.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sports, contacts with natives and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump to administration and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time to bridge, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling, he could no help in Urbach nobody, do not work, and be unprofitable, who will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The distinct majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, problem occurs, however, says customer honestly," people, in which nothing goes. "the work of Deuschle and customer therefore is always to motivate others to motivate them."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two after the recent occurrences of fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," "what manholes can call naive." a Resdreamko can and would not shut it out. "</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitized are the helper but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They could have the fear that the attacks bring them completely into discall.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with that," "says Regine customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would happily stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary work must be held in place and in the region to activities.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon a new push for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy is heinous."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them on-site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like", "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine's customer also makes clear that the Urbach are already busy at the time, to make up the present people reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, since there is no simple answers."</seg>
