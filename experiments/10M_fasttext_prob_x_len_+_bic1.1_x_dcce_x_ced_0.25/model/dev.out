Obama receiving Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has not been very friendly .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Teheran &apos;s destabil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about a conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the ongoing settlement of Israel and against a lack of support in the peace process .
&quot; by the deal of the Obama &apos;s deal to deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , for the invitation of the Re@@ public@@ ans held a controversial speech before the US Congress , Netanyahu suffered a imp@@ aired against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not talked about with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the upcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in a emergency call Professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon greeted with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and would have to come to his home . &quot;
&quot; it was important to emphas@@ ise that his &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; but still live and probably upset , and he said the family contacts the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officers found the cor@@ pse of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ er and a hand@@ written note that was found on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I cared , I cared , Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was signed by him after details of the authorities in the letter , and he was greeted . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that he represented in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi ; he has already taken 300 miles to the school grounds , where he made the police shot a popular history professor , eth@@ ane Schmidt , at the door to his office and killed . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ ben@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff members have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he made the f@@ ateful emergency point after that time .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb was taking the life , when the police captured him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators to both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him , helped to draw a picture of one talented but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they looked forward to their education .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ t died , he said no history of violence or criminal record . &quot;
Schmidt himself mentioned his book in a written book in which he mentioned his &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life .
&quot; both established in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members are 17 members , and many students visited classes of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ours .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , he &apos;s sitting , he also seemed a bit excited and nervous as if something wrong with him was wrong . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb of him told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
Lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for a health check out health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
this year he made only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in employment policy of the university means that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard for him , would be no guarantee of an automatic way to the employment as Assistant Assistant . &quot;
&quot; William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between he and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
they are questions that he cannot answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police took a lead later than again to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber guns in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of its par@@ ental home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , told Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb was walking to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; he started his work at the University , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12@@ ,000 residents and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he graduated in the spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the many years of friends made it as intelligent , charis@@ matic and fun . &quot;
&quot; Carla H@@ air@@ ston said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when she met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were at high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar game for several years . &quot;
at that time he was the woman &apos;s flock .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted that when he was , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson Vor@@ stadt of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ er were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , I told my wife &quot; , &quot; but there was no certificate of any marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick @-@ house that is adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said , they were for@@ ged 15 years ago , but friends were left and a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; it was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en over his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he &apos;s interested in music and played blues . &quot;
Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ a when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail met both for a summer in three years ago .
later they played together one or the other G@@ ig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse used for different companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ keeper , and sometimes maintenance coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night ended the night 5 September , after he finished his guitar and harmon@@ ic@@ ity before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign of something that something was wrong .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the end and let them meet each other .
&quot; yes . I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead @-@ born professor , led the first semester seminar and specialized on American natives and Col@@ onial history , &quot; Don W@@ an Mitchell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student Committee .

the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we are trying to move our students back to the return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors EM@@ IL@@ us Far@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans led to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police did now say that &apos;s made the emergency , after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb was killed in his emergency treatment as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the Roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for a forthcoming documentary &apos; Back in Time . &quot;

UN boss says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General B@@ an K@@ i @-@ moon says that his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of nearly five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will make violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN boss will again call upon all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;

he regre@@ ts that the divisions within the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable .
&quot; on the other hand , B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria , which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear agreement with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; however , no matter how some Re@@ public@@ ans attempt to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the upper ranks in surveys down , it has ( still ) does not work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to ask itself seriously what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate Mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claimed that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ ys lead to the rising Herman C@@ ain , none of them had only gained a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he could have fought in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ side groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow , to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate @-@ Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
m@@ umps popularity characteristics have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l a positive one . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
some three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
these figures hold themselves in the early States .
&quot; a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac setup in Iowa has found last week , that 60 percent of the Republi@@ can have some good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey conducted by CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week , 67 percent of the Republi@@ can ans , they were either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if an ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; Ben Car@@ son only creates the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; vs. 40 per cent , which tell the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next one in the enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the Favor@@ ite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Re@@ public@@ ans sees its umps tem@@ per not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of the re@@ public@@ ans of Irish voters believe that the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is to be found in the country of the nation , the state of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the Republi@@ can re@@ consider that he has the personality for Commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not into the White House of Philipp@@ i , ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put their nest @-@ horses keep Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real .
&quot; if they are asked who the GO@@ P nom@@ ination would be asked , say after a survey conducted by CN@@ N / Or@@ c from last week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
that &apos;s a change from time when four out of ten will put their money on Je@@ b Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters do not have the clear@@ est Crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle four out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans , that Rick Per@@ ry would attract the nom@@ ination to only 28 % for the final Candi@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
nevertheless a large number of GO@@ P @-@ voters p@@ umped campaign was seen as plau@@ si@@ bly .
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump pi@@ cks almost every one . &quot;
some experts point out that the sh@@ atter@@ ing field is likely to contribute to a pi@@ vot@@ al leadership while the anti @-@ aging support is spread to more than a dozen other candidate .
&quot; but a survey of the Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that , in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ an @-@ head @-@ race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will be serious . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , especially Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , especially J@@ b Bush 19 points , and finally before the edge of Paul , John Ka@@ meet and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ on @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who strikes it ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump fans says that they have formed themselves of their mind .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday demonstrated that only a little over half the voters want to support the Tr@@ ump , they say their voices are strongly awarded . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that and no one can truly say to never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is star@@ st competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their mind are twice as often for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say , they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump on immigration . &quot;
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election @-@ election was called two months of immigrants from Mexico , &quot; rap@@ ists &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ bas@@ tic prin@@ t@@ atively from Tr@@ ump &apos;s crucial Hisp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can Party and permanently damaged the development of new progressive efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump in case of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration in the lim@@ eli@@ ght , it becomes Donald Tr@@ ump to do too . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbed to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son is now about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , notably through their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new assembly survey of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ si@@ ders than one with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Iowa two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa Re@@ public@@ ans are frustrated by the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent dis@@ satisfied &apos; and 21 per cent &apos; ru@@ dd@@ led . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential building in Germany
here on the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , cost of one square meter of a th@@ at@@ ched @-@ house in the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the offer of objects naturally is limited , &quot; says it in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study reveals that special layers will most cost a square meter at most .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a dor@@ m bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top benefit , one of the price is given as a pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ l has published a list of most exclusive German residence sites - with square me@@ ter@@ ous praise in vibr@@ ating heights .

Champions League : Bayern @-@ Traum@@ stra@@ y thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
doubts go@@ al@@ keeper in Pir@@ e : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller on the FC Bayern the way to a con@@ den@@ sing 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then ran . &quot;
a sovereign in the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have taken a dream start to FC Bayern in the Wit@@ de@@ pot of Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; &quot; mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their night play in the Champions League at the Greek record attendance Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers twin pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth race success in Serie is meant to be the first step in the final phase of the final of 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the Hen@@ kel@@ o head to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
Müller was awarded on his 28 results in the Champions League for the Bayern @-@ leadership of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto which made a footh@@ old of the grand@@ master of the world &apos;s champion .
&quot; we will not be underestimated , &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame was promised before the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ aki &apos;s stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot fans , and the Munich were talking . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated idea of it without shine .
&quot; Piraeus had won his recent six home games in the Royal class , among them against well @-@ known cl@@ ubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , raised in seven European ac@@ up @-@ du@@ els with Greek people , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went to be courageous , but in their un@@ compromising efforts , but often too little of works . &quot;
the attacks were often introduced by game shift on the left @-@ part Douglas Costa initiated by the former Braunschwei@@ g Omar Eli@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck on the right side when its flan@@ k struck out of the right half @-@ field in the upper left of the rear .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , when the Olympi@@ ac@@ os da@@ ye Brown proposed the head@@ ball of Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by multi@@ tap the Tor@@ wart Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5th ) .
although the Bayern her lived dominant game was taken up , Pi@@ re@@ aus was able to stick to the itch . &quot;
on Tor@@ ke@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er was but out of the way .
&quot; for example , when he made a shot of ide@@ ye over the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New@@ ardi@@ ola , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola left a four @-@ bed chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bol@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the cad@@ res , sat first at first . &quot;
&quot; the hero @-@ hero was given the green light only after the closing mass , &quot; &quot; Sports &quot; &quot; said Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky , &quot; &quot; who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ignant . &quot;
&quot; at the first time , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him , when he was king King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the escaped gro@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) , and took 13 minutes later everything clear , with El@@ f@@ m@@ n Müller appointed a dr@@ one . &quot;
in front of the game it was lost in the stadium of Kra@@ w@@ alle .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly shou@@ ting Bavaria fans in their spect@@ ator @-@ block , the supporters of Ho@@ sts Pir@@ e had prov@@ oked by words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went with stro@@ kes against the Mün@@ chner supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose your teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , does not only sh@@ it the lungs , but also the teeth - that puts a number of Potsdam &apos;s long @-@ term study . &quot;
the good news : in ren@@ unciation the risk decreases fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is composed of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ F@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to non @-@ smoking , smoking at risk of losing their teeth prematurely to get the 2,@@ 5@@ - up to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 participants .
&quot; primary causes for tooth decay be tooth decay and inflammation of the g@@ um , stresses the DI@@ RE@@ E . &quot;
for this par@@ o@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor that stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and loss loss therefore goes back to common gin@@ gi@@ um disease at smokers .
&quot; clarified , to what extent smoking is also the risk of dental c@@ aries increased . &quot;
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk however within a short period of time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat to the level of N@@ iz@@ ers sin@@ ke , declared Cre@@ ate@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one had to convince humans to become non @-@ smokers , he stated Mr. H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; cigarette smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and vessels and also leads to our knowledge to a good dental health up to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population are affected by p@@ air@@ lessness in the age of 65 to 74 years . &quot;
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking the risk of early tooth breakdown .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inning the findings .

EU Commission on TTIP report to TTIP
&quot; to achieve shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed extensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
the controversial private arbitration institutions for disputes between companies and states should therefore be replaced by a transpar@@ ent@@ eric system that corresponds considerably more traditional dishes in its functioning .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that the citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared the responsible EU Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström had no idea . &quot;
the Ch@@ din has accused of introducing the proposal as a European negoti@@ able position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is supposed to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
&quot; &quot; &quot; plans to re@@ forming the current arbitration proceedings can be held specifically for the EU and the USA to jointly choose independent judges for a new European Court . &quot;
&quot; they are to be derived from equal parts from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;
it is for the first time that a second instance .
it would permit it to raise against judgment .
&quot; until now the process of processing among each other at the arbitr@@ ator , an objection to the judg@@ ments did not exist . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past few months it has become clear that citizens are not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in terms of fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work for its own information on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; in this context , there can also be clarified , for instance , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states . &quot;
the main reasons for the investor @-@ state arbitration sets aside ( IS@@ DS ) are considered one of the main reasons for the big resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbitration courts are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel violence , on the company law@@ suits , national laws , or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
in the first statements Anti @-@ TTIP @-@ organisations like Camp@@ act under@@ signed the proposals from the European Commission as inadequate .
critic@@ ised the deal has not been critic@@ ised for the free trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) for the already negotiated trade agreements with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) .
the German economic state Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) signed the plans in contrast as a great progress .
&quot; the Commission considered essential points to reform Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel in spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbitr@@ al tri@@ bun@@ als were from the table .
the French government also welcomed plans of Malm@@ ström .
&quot; the European company &quot; B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE &quot; , &quot; previously warned against the pi@@ pelines of the economy through too many new rules . &quot;
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be disadvantaged in it .
when the talks on the free trade agreement TTIP ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) can be completed on Wednesday .
the negotiations have been ongoing since the middle of 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investors protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
a framework for the agreement was originally expected at the end of this year .
this date counts as no longer lasting .
saus@@ age Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Köl@@ ner Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the timi@@ d cor@@ ks@@ y f@@ ading the picturesque U.S. state of Michigan has recorded with fil@@ lets . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 persons , is almost captured by St@@ ev@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; he talks on the basis of several places that he will always draw on the map , what his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and tender are arranged . &quot;
&quot; where they were created , and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens proved to be a wonderful cre@@ tan . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 announced and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Michigan : the Great Lake State &quot; appear clever comp@@ ut@@ ated songs , which narro@@ wer very close to American folk folk of the late sixteenth @-@ six@@ ties but can always drive towards home opul@@ ent . &quot;

&quot; although here nearly 2000 guests were engaged in their chairs , the blo@@ oming St@@ ev@@ ens returns to the intimacy and the folk . &quot;
&quot; without placing a word to the public , the group plays an excellent musician through the wide enriched album . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ates at the Succ@@ ession of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Deb@@ ates is expected in line with the premi@@ ership of the Prime Minister with a tension . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to give his debut in the premi@@ ership of the Prime Minister and with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask for the first of his six pre @-@ defined questions shortly after noon and being examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from near .
he called for &quot; fewer theatre and more facts &quot; during this weekly event .
he also said that he can skip some meetings to give her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , because after his appointment it comes to the member of the shadow interior and his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour chairman , on Tuesday during the flood of the National An@@ them , voted for the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the center of several theme @-@ pages in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had gotten &quot; in a respectable silence &quot; and he had the &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the aerial fl@@ ab@@ ed around England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns shadow rapporteur , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news program , he turned the Labour @-@ president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns excellence , and they were called upon differences in business , defence and foreign affairs , while less than a h@@ th of the parliamentary party was originally supported by the leaders . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also put in &quot; &quot; st@@ acking &quot; &quot; to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements on the position of the European Union and the limiting to winn@@ ings . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C Conference on making Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a whole .
&quot; hours later , Mr Smith , the shadow of Labour and R@@ ent ministers said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to lower the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour Chair , David Cameron , who has since sold T@@ ory boss , over the last decade as the dispute @-@ Box in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour Leader made a different policy approach , says he &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr. Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the fra@@ grant of the Prime Minister has made to confront , and that he will refrain both &quot; &quot; perc@@ ussions &quot; and the fighting with resistance and instead , to concentrate on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadows of companies represented in him if he does not participate , for example when Mr. Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea to conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he said John Ber@@ cow , the spokes@@ man of the house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; &quot; that often linked to the Prime Minister . but a couple of years later he de@@ pl@@ ated that he has failed in it . &quot;
&quot; since she was first sent on TV in 1990 , the question was seen by Prime Minister as the principal bar@@ ometer of the leader of a leader and position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics have argued that they become a caricature and gave more @-@ deepening reforms . &quot;

pounds of accelerated wage growth in the UK
&quot; the Po@@ unds climbed up @-@ nicely after data , which indicates a rise in wages of the United Kingdom . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was raised by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage was the fastest since 2009 and brought an estim@@ ation to the time of an interest increase .
the pound grew by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1.@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was glu@@ ed up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € .
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the ri@@ vals AB In@@ Be@@ v received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as bud@@ dies , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were looking forward to encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods from Ri@@ chem@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reg@@ res@@ sed growth .
&quot; shares from Glen@@ core climbed by 5 % , after the mining t@@ ese said that he took 2.5 billion $ by a share of debt as part of its strategy of debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , and with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment to the company R@@ ating on &quot; . &quot; &quot;
J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % after the sports@@ car company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million .
the leader of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages threaten the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK @-@ workers &apos; might mean more purchasing power in the pockets of the potential customers &apos; .
&quot; but it was unlikely that this merchant force will balance the higher labour costs at his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet expansion plans of J@@ D sports , he added and this could mean there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A @-@ poster brings the Lebanese of the potato d@@ ön@@ er idea
potatoes or flo@@ or@@ ers ?
it is both - and even in the potato d@@ der which has developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger Imb@@ i Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y .
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; Kar@@ to@@ alo , &quot; with er &quot; on a poster with the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y Kar@@ to@@ ffel and Me@@ at put together on a sp@@ ie@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him to the idea of a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the ins@@ cription &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of Rock@@ ers &quot; , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , there is a barbecue in its store that is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has now signed the Lebanese living in Munich in the pat@@ ron@@ age in Munich .
there it has recently been protected as use pattern according to the Authority .
&quot; how much meat and as much potatoes of the sp@@ it contains , Al@@ ha@@ y wants to reveal it . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes together even better , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with his clients , the culinary international understanding also is good . &quot;
met@@ res@@ .com starts on the campaign &apos;s campaign to fight against al@@ di@@ - degeneration
met@@ ros seeks to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branches in front of an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler met@@ res@@ tra@@ der has started an ab@@ out@@ edge campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di @-@ invasion .
&quot; at Al@@ di , the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia are prepared at the beginning of next year , to reinforce Met@@ abol@@ ism and Ig@@ A super@@ marktes their relations with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A through mainstream marketing and marketing on social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough that distributed in Ig@@ A stores and shop @-@ owner , who sell the cheapest tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ abol@@ ishes further details of its defence strategy on 29th September , when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investors . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia are nearly 30 percent of met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ charging @-@ business , and higher profits as a met@@ cas@@ hes Ig@@ A @-@ network in the east @-@ states . &quot;
&quot; purchases in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ or@@ ically provincial and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers come across a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared to about 14 percent in Western Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley that Al@@ di 12 months after the opening of its first markets , around five percent of the food market will sn@@ ore in these two states and will take away all available players , but primarily independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , Tom K@@ ier@@ ath by Morgan Stan@@ ley explained that Ig@@ A @-@ retailers may lose $ 360 million sales per year and cash cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this prognosis was based on the assumption that Al@@ di has opened 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , in the next year and will generate sales of $ 500 million and € 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and in the quantities at met@@ cas@@ a &apos;s high fix@@ tic cost @-@ based could cost cash around 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ abol@@ Market shares in the East states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent pol@@ led survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that Ig@@ A @-@ buyers are the most faithful ones . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumed that met@@ cas@@ hs turnover in the food and grocery store by 3.@@ 8 per cent in 2017 and 2.@@ 1 per cent in 2017 and 2.2 percent in 2015 will reduce the market share by 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week told the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business in Melbourne , that met@@ ros will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ ros declined to respond publicly to the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ abol@@ ism with Mr Dou@@ glass last week is in contact .
&quot; IG@@ As Market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and grocery stores that has been awarded by 43 percent since 2012 , which is about 43 percent , which is reflected in the operating debt reduction in simultaneous pressure on turnover and margins . &quot;
the wholes@@ al@@ ers however res@@ isted more than 150 million dollars to provide sales prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and Ig@@ A @-@ retailers in improving their stores by faster growing fresh foods to supply and deliver a better selection of private @-@ label foods .
met@@ cas@@ hs main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the pricing and shop @-@ recovery programmes are added to El@@ an and hopes that the wholes@@ aler in 2017 will return to an income growth for the first time in four years .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ en@@ akis is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ x Kok@@ te@@ akis deserves more praise than criticism for its behaviour .
Than@@ x Kok@@ te@@ akis was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves more praise than criticism for his own behaviour .
&quot; Co@@ kin@@ akis , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got pushed into the spotlight by the in@@ famous hearing of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ RIN@@ KA in the Montreal Masters in lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ akis and his opponent Ry@@ an Harrison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , where Harrison would have called &quot; &quot; W@@ AW@@ RIN@@ KA would have hit K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; recently , as he was seen a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ ant was das@@ hed out a potential US @-@ Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ da was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place in the single behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing about which I caught me pretty , is the fact that after my view Than@@ asi became a little in the dispute . &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken one stro@@ ck , when he lost a bat in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken down from Fr@@ ust with herself , and I am than@@ asi good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he earned a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated very little too . &quot;
&quot; he is a very irrit@@ able 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never worked a problem with the other players , he is working hard , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to consider K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os on important decisions , which starts on Friday and it describes the &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for everyone , but it ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a solid solid component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is completely concentrated on the competition and not all the controversy around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick felt very quickly made the ascent to what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he gets involved in the eyes of the public , and he deserves to support him . some time outside the spotlight , in which he can only think about it , and it &apos;s best for the crew and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares independence , closes the border , holding refugees back &quot;
&quot; Hungary declares the emergency and ri@@ dden the border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all states to try to get illegal in the country . everything with the aim , stopping the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed by the border , when hundreds of migrants were re@@ acted to a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acting public officials with revolt . &quot;
people who were fled to violence were set out for a unknown period of time in a ro@@ am on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents and settled down there .
but frustr@@ ations asc@@ ended .
&quot; as a police @-@ helicopter above them sh@@ aded , the migrants &quot; open the border ! &quot; and sm@@ elled insul@@ ts against the Hungarian poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
some records from protest food and water back .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister explained that there is &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be sent out of Hungary while more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral policy .
&quot; in the coming days of talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Turkish Serbian border came to a day after the 28 @-@ nations block in Brussels failed to make no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were in over @-@ shr@@ unk Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or until the end of the year - an agreement was agreed that the EU states would include further 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday to discuss a special summit of the European Union to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a soon @-@ wing campaign from Brussels or from its neighbours . &quot;
&quot; the alleged emergency situation in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to told him that his country would also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire , along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , having stopped a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
C@@ BS news correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison breeds in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck of war from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East towards a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ Pass . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has however passed , however , that most incoming economic migrants are people who are looking for better life and not war @-@ refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws which occurred at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us who abolished the government alongside the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also place higher arrest warrant for condemned men . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said Government speaker from tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament has to approve the operation of the military , nor is it expected for the next week , but re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have looked at the border with hard armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advisor for Or@@ ban , said that authorities got 45 people at trying to cross the border , 15 others were already deeper into the country . &quot;
they come across as they corrupt the fence ; they are now in custody and will be accused of criminal off@@ ences according to the new laws .
authorities are putting the fence quickly .
&quot; Hungarian officials concluded on Tuesday morning also two of the seven border crossing with Serbia , after a migr@@ atory train with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos conver@@ ged the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to work with the data of people and a crowd of people pressed to settle there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to come in , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would deny food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton with Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to keep a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race at the national level but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins the face of the ground .
&quot; Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the previous elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ ander is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced , whether he nom@@ inee for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the vote for the vote . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined to what candidates they will support . &quot;
but Clin@@ tons are in their election more enduring than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News @-@ survey , Clinton has lost in a series of demographic groups , while S@@ anders has achieved some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a large margin in women and moder@@ ates , but these pre @-@ proj@@ ections have reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders will be back only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s advantage in democratic constitu@@ ents under 50 years has become more volati@@ le , and they are now on the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit lead with the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the elections were held nationwide , that they would be by Clinton to support him if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
a neighbourhood would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they nom@@ inee the nom@@ inee .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ tons current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it especially from her .
the opinions are stronger with those who are not at the present Clinton - just about a quarter would help them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 per cent of the democratic voters of the elections say , Clinton to support Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters say this about their candidate . Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ tons are asked in an open question why they want that they have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the opinion that it &apos;s time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
his connection with Bill Clinton is also mentioned in his connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
approval to dealing with the problems and the voting rights are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president raises potential for the presidential office in the orph@@ an@@ ium , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections will see him in the race - although a third believes that he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters in the presidential elections are asked , who would have a second choice for the party is Bi@@ den . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons followers , more than half that Bi@@ den would have their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if bi@@ den not to run for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton will also be ex@@ tri@@ ght against S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five per cent of the democratic voters see Clinton as candidate , with the best opportunities to win the election ; however , this figure has declined from 78 per cent to the last month . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage he considers it &quot; &quot; sel@@ ector , &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate call democratic voters issues concerning the voting . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for this vot@@ ings of the elections is rather unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates achieve good results with some important characteristics with the voters of the presidential elections of their party .
&quot; we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and equipped with strong leadership style . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ ds are best kept at the three candidates at honesty , while Clin@@ tons &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not believe it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the elections are in general also Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ ological ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about one quarter of the democratic voters do not think of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions of Hill@@ ary Clin@@ tons are continuing to be made as an outdoor Minister , most of the Democratic voters in the presidential elections are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story altogether in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on their general opinion by Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it even deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 , who say that their views of Clinton had become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this continues to be a problem for them under eligible voters : only 32 % see them as honest and trustworthy , eight per cent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the constitu@@ ents do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time 55 per cent of the people entitled &quot; &quot; take no longer ste@@ amer &quot; &quot; as not honest and not trustworthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump will nevertheless receive good notes in leadership .
&quot; out of the six tested candidates Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best in honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but like Car@@ son many do not believe in him . &quot;
&quot; the fault rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic constitu@@ ents in the pre @-@ election is 6 percent points . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son is approaching a survey close behind Donald Tr@@ ump
Ben Car@@ son is present at the latest survey conducted by C@@ BS News / New York Times behind Donald Tr@@ ump
the two candidates have now published half of the elec@@ torate for voters in the new survey and others are losing dramatically .
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support stal@@ k in large numbers . the support grows by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which has been conducted before Fox news debate last month in order to 27 % in survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son drops in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demographic groups really arrive and Tr@@ ump will sur@@ pass by Republi@@ can voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ itself , is struck with Wis@@ dom into the Governor Scott Walker , who remains at the deepest , and from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; the former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the fault of the bu@@ ff at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son desc@@ ends in the inquiries - he lands with 19 % support in the Re@@ public@@ ans , behind the Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of one last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump thought some si@@ p@@ hi@@ ves for the former neuro@@ surgeon and even after Car@@ son exc@@ used to question trac@@ ts faith in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump on the last Saturday during a public appearance in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is at the moment warm up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if excellent levels are measured only in the distance , for bathing lau@@ ber , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough to do the warm water . &quot;
a dip in North &amp; Baltic Sea is likely to be a pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; no longer goes to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , shares the Deutsche Wetter@@ dienst ( DW@@ D ) with . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Mediterranean Sea still offers the Mediterranean : in the east it even comes up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic sea , it is placed in the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood en@@ cum@@ ber@@ ed with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a cru@@ pul@@ ous ritual for a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder will be filed against 5 persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI pushed &quot; &quot; Michael &quot; &quot; during one introduc@@ tory ritual in September 2013 and delayed his transport to hospital , which contributed to his death , shared the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been charged with connected eyes with a 30 Po@@ und back@@ pack of sand , and repeatedly attacked , while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about head@@ ache , then it fell unconscious . &quot;
the members of the P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI Brotherhood does not demand the emergency number 911 that was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police .
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to goo@@ gle his symptoms , and Andy Men@@ g to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , in order to seek advice , said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members got to hide and hide the welfare of the Brotherhood - basically about the good of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ti@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ve , and he died in the next morning at his wounds . &quot;
&quot; after an auto@@ cr@@ unch @-@ report , Den@@ g has been repeatedly added with pot@@ ter strength injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the governor of the Brotherhood - at least one student dies in the ship since 1970 . , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be called to account , and this step of authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended a accus@@ ation due to murder of the third density of the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with deportation and formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - official or un@@ officially , this is sanc@@ tioned , we will also hold this to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national Brotherhood re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a raise will come , and the house will fall into the sha@@ king , ren@@ ding for bonds will rise , and the economy will be in a recession . &quot;
we know that .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it all take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy is only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came up within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when raising the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the U.S. Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to raise interest rates , but rather on the time period that is required for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could determine that the whole excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to a f@@ iller increase . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably interpreted by some as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief Econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no re@@ perc@@ ussions . &quot;
here is a future based on historical trends such as some areas of the economy might react :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the reduction of tax evasion things for a while volati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seem to be a tendency that assets s@@ cour@@ sed 12 to 24 months after the initial increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German bank analysts in a newer study on what happens after inser@@ tion of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in the past 35 years , the market is generally black@@ out - about 14 percent - on the way to the inser@@ ting increase , then back to the normal state after 500 days , then back to the normal yield in the past six cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , Bob D@@ oll , Chef facility @-@ Str@@ ate@@ ge at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the equi@@ ties later occur in the cycle @-@ cycle and returns to yield .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but they often promote plac@@ ements .
in the present case the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions that had not existed before and could accelerate a recession .
&quot; extremely remarkable is that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest score , with a f@@ ender of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 r@@ ents since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP in excess of 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 rose by 3.@@ 6 percent , only a few expected that this will last and expect the third quarter of the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; quotes at any such fragile economic backdrop could be risky and throw the question &quot; &quot; whether it is different this time &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken up the whole year on a inser@@ ting points , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; during many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe the FO@@ MC could increase an increase in this meeting , the fut@@ ures trading gives only a 25 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the cycle cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP instead of pre @-@ rec@@ essions , very quickly after the beginning of recovery in the shadows , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and these have been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed income was also volati@@ le , since the market takes a raise , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than when , if that change its strategic course . &quot;
&quot; when bonds the ren@@ ames appear to change , as soon as the first increase in the cycle is made . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the cycle @-@ cycle , the her@@ al@@ ps immediately fall , the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the rise in the interest rates will lead to bringing back possible , between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atter of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ lateral bonds often bring better income in such a climate , even though &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s interesting , that the markets have already adapted itself to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , the income gap has increased and the volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed intensified their strategy . &quot;
&quot; across the globe , businesses that benefit the larger share of its operations in the United States will benefit from interest rates and local products are more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debts will be worse , as an increasing of the dollar is making their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; stocks tend to react very positively three months after an initial appearance , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analy@@ st in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have out@@ stand@@ ed companies with a strong balance sheet after each of the Z@@ advertise increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital prices as well as low volati@@ lity in its shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by average 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt will be a major problem .
&quot; enterprises with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , &quot; says Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure stock , consumers will also benefit from rising dollars . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits from higher yields , even if experts in different opinion are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Spe@@ aker Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the transm@@ itter because of its &quot; &quot; con@@ tainment &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ is@@ hable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at BBC Music Awards and said that they im@@ it@@ ated only The Br@@ its .
EP @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins picked up the show of The Voice and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leader in parliament@@ arian and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter to prove that he does not do something that does not do the private channels . &quot;
&quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham was also the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the publicly @-@ legal Radi@@ ost@@ al &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; and increasingly is no longer distingu@@ is@@ hable from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 appears , I don &apos;t like to use the word &apos; silly &apos; , but it seems to transform itself to Classic FM &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you &apos;re trying to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , where you actually only im@@ it@@ ating what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ General Director pointed out the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 reaches far ahead of its commercial ties , when it comes to live music and education . &quot;
what I learn about Radio 3 I will not do any other way through classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music @-@ making that really is un@@ matched .
&quot; and giving the commitment of Radio 3 , new music and giving new works in order , I do consider it really important . &quot; &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey , that was harder to get involved to engage the audience when it did in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing focused on the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport under fire , taking the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins The Voice on - the musical talent show of the BBC , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of 22 million £ . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often being discussed , because it is not original and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
&quot; Lord Hall ins@@ isted that the BBC 1 @-@ show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judge - &quot; &quot; in particular BBC &quot; &quot; was produced . &quot;
&quot; he added : he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; hit out of our house @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when it was the next time a group of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he ref@@ itted to exclude the order from any series of The Voice in the future or give money to the char@@ ator for other bar@@ ker formats . &quot;
Internet sales climbed in August on the slow and the Black Friday can be responsible for this
in the first three months of 2015 seven percent increase in the online sales .
in the last month the lowest result has been presented since the beginning of the record in 2000
online sales strengthened three years ago by using cell@@ phones to buy
experts believe that the Black Friday in November has slo@@ wed down the money .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has curved , and many of the main shopping streets in Britain have turned into gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
&quot; yet experts say that there are now signs that st@@ agn@@ ate online revenues , after new numbers shown only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that launch online sales after new numbers show just seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the years and go back to 2000 , this has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG @-@ sales of the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he stated that the online sales began three years ago , as a buyer , having their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online , and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now the one comm@@ utes itself , and we may possibly experience that growth is reduced . &quot;
&quot; the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the successive revenue . &quot;
experts believe that buyers have res@@ ign their purchases on this occasion which takes place on the last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers to use their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some retailer sites cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers are fighting against bar@@ gains , buyers that could hold any purchases . &quot;
&quot; a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium was a result of more than 1 £ 1,000 on the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium . &quot;
&quot; with some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of these purchases are now carried out on web shops . &quot;
at the same time more than one quarter of the people wear clothes and shoes online instead of moving in the interior cities .
Muslims who buried in Mecca when the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the bodies of 29 dead are carried by Muslims by the first funer@@ als in Mecca by the streets .
Saudi @-@ Arabia places the collapse in part of the huge Sau@@ d Bin Laden @-@ group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition 3@@ 94 people were injured , after the crane cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered , when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury who were killed , when a crane to Mecca Grand mo@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; gri@@ pping @-@ filled , mostly stain@@ ed in white , the track in order to declare their respect , when the first of the dead appeared their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ z cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral proc@@ ession went down to the holy place , where only days before a construction was put through the roof of the mosque , and then on the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses were released for the funeral , as the Saudi king over the building company of the family Bin Laden because of the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 &apos;s last , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 servants that were killed , as a crane through the Great Central mo@@ wer of Mek@@ ong , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane sat down . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was in the Great Mos@@ que with his parents before the start of the annual hit .
&quot; Saudi officials have already pointed firmly that the H@@ add@@ afi went to Mecca , with thousands who continue to come to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin @-@ Laden group would not have left the arm of the Cran@@ e , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the secre@@ tion , which was published by the state Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group would be responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking service of the news agency reported this detail , said however , that the management of the company must be abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man threw gr@@ abs , leading the overthrow of the sick , who threw in a courtyard of the big mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims took place before the h@@ add@@ sch who later takes place in this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin @-@ Laden group issued no statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree critici@@ zed also the group because of not current security measures and because they have not co @-@ operated with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes around Mecca and Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee is part of the massive construction project that is headed by the Bin Laden group .

&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q Shops , because eight out of ten purchasing decisions in the store are made by women . &quot;
in the moment the men prevail .
&quot; she said it was necessary to place the growing demographic trends that have more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we need to move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers from women are about 80 percent of the decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of just five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also been instruc@@ ted to reflect her top team to reflect a equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied precisely 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial departments . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important issue .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her showed a decline in half @-@ year profit and the moving after the group &apos;s cost of dra@@ ining the stores .
&quot; due to the trends , King@@ fis@@ her , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q are open , 200 new branches . &quot;
Func@@ tion@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the national Court Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday there have been two function@@ aries of the Austrian Volleyball Vic@@ em@@ e@@ isters A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and dis@@ for@@ estation .
the accused are not guilty .
one of them had also been charged with abuse of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the present process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the alleged accommodation pro@@ secutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had cryst@@ alli@@ zed in the examination that the accused were allowed to disp@@ ose of the accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , about which they were able to disp@@ ose in their functions , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage caused by some 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the anti @-@ Func@@ tion@@ aries are also charged with financial subsidies .
&quot; the fact divided the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ at , Ri@@ dge in Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; as a result of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence represents that the association had no time taken an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports@@ men had only doubled up @-@ to @-@ wall damage , and invested a lot of time and money from 1982 to 2011 - Pas@@ va carried out about 600@@ ,000 k@@ illing ( approx . 34@@ ,000 Euros ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; back then we were standing in front of the situation : do we conduct the club on or block it ? &quot; , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ ie Grand @-@ chair@@ manship of the financial market . &quot;
he decided to take this task with his colleague and co @-@ def@@ endants .
with any risks .
&quot; we have put money to put our life insurance as a safety at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in submission . &quot;
&quot; the association was agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the payout of the allowance should be determined retro@@ actively by 1991 by giving the financial success of the payout . &quot;
&quot; therefore one part of the allowance should be paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus had been in the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the sum @-@ rate and non @-@ details falls on , explained the ex @-@ handed the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and C@@ ac@@ tion@@ aries managed the two def@@ endants , &quot; said the second accused . &quot;
why the payments should not be revealed in detail by the association put the judge in question .
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for the financial support , so important was the debts of the debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in 2011 , against the an official investigation for abuse of ministry began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the association account . &quot;
&quot; these have been back , explained the accused . &quot;
&quot; this upgrade account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and according to its statement , the association was not known . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; &quot; wanted the judge &quot;
then the praying long didn &apos;t know an answer .
&quot; finally he said , he believed that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything of this money , the pro@@ secutor had taken in the room . &quot;
&quot; the collaborators had been informed , the function@@ aries were righteous . &quot;
this refer@@ ral was formulated as a &quot; claim of claims . &quot;
why are In@@ dem@@ nity ? they wanted to know Ri@@ er@@ in and At@@ tor@@ ney .
&quot; the first def@@ endant was explained , he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never created a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what can I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; with whom you are all off the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a representative ? , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said , he never referred to a c@@ ents salary , he only claims o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; on diet , he added the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual effort has been much higher , he added . &quot;
precise records for the early years could not show the def@@ endants .
&quot; these were according to a business examination in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer kept , explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter also had the second accused .
&quot; all the signs are in cash , in addition , he led to the bank of the international law to lead to lead to lead in place , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing was continued on September 23 with the survey of witnesses .

&quot; in this way , it is expected to save costs of $ 2.7 billion ( 2.@@ 4 billion euros ) , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a nominal value of about $ 2.7 billion , which will drop from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;

conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would be largely out of rejection : 54 per cent contradic@@ ts themselves , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
&quot; that other countries fly air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , 24 percent are to intervene in the conflict . &quot;

R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent upheav@@ al in ser@@ b@@ ian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took part in the Ser@@ b @-@ Ser@@ b border with R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ kel and wat@@ erg@@ ers against several hundreds of refugees .
Eur@@ one@@ ws &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Boz@@ si@@ k has experienced the exchange of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke the border .
behind it had formed a police line and behind the poli@@ c@@ emen a water front had been prepared .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw on rocks , st@@ aves and plastic bottles by the officials . &quot;
the officers first continued un@@ inter@@ rupt@@ edly pepper spray .
after that the police took Tr@@ än@@ d .
much tre@@ ach@@ ia was buried towards the refugees in the direction of Refu@@ ge@@ es .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; observed the world when the US staff is coming together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday to meet the important decision whether for the first time , for nearly a decade , interest rates are imposed or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Re@@ uters , found out that a little more than half , which would still last week , think that the F@@ ed will do somewhat longer and keep interest rates on the current state of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event since it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rate at N@@ UL@@ L .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank could enter the zero domain and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ sti@@ tial , CEO of St. Peter Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good power level , tri@@ llion dollars is added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less force@@ ful view of global proportions . &quot;
&quot; it has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 20 : 00 CET on Thursday .
death scor@@ er at the Delta State University left ap@@ ologies
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed himself , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted to &quot; &quot; he could make it un@@ doing , &quot; &quot; said government on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he , professor of geography and social education at the Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning called &quot;
&quot; and he said , he was shot and someone killed . &quot;
he told the staff of the emergency central that police officers must send c@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but that &quot; no one will distur@@ b , &quot; but probably be upset . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller , after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police performed the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ er , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could und@@ o it . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note he took 300 miles to Delta State University , where he took E@@ ane Schmidt , a professor for history , k@@ ills before he eventually took his own life on Monday , when poli@@ c@@ emen took him . &quot;
&quot; William La@@ For@@ ge said , he knew nothing of a conflict between he and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs concept . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday which he said that Pr@@ enti@@ er didn &apos;t have a relationship with Schmidt , said authorities on Tuesday , there &quot; &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; &quot; for a tr@@ ec@@ ks@@ relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ er was elected by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said that she had been married about seven years ago when a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two have been for@@ ged 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he and Pr@@ enti@@ t have a daughter who is 19 , and they have been destroyed in the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss their daughter were &quot; absolute best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ er worked online from home , according to statement by L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les that was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a tight friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog called Light@@ ning , met for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to always help other people , &quot; says K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , at a certain point in the Monday he called to say to them , &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; as a poli@@ c@@ emen found him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , he drove his car to the side , fled by walking , ran into the forest and k@@ ills himself with a shot . &quot;
he obtained a doctoral title in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University to give a degree of vig@@ or to the university &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is building the Group
Lufthansa is planning a big concert restructuring .
&quot; one half billion euros a year wants to save the Lufthansa business alone , with a better organization . &quot;
&quot; 150 of the world &apos;s approximately 1,000 executives will cost the workplace throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot plant union , there is also the new treaty . &quot;
the Lufthansa is building its corporate structure and values the Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution fee of roughly 500 million euros a year from cost @-@ sol@@ em@@ gies , distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , in the Lufthansa there is no more board to the passenger in the future . &quot;
the Bil@@ o@@ lig@@ hier@@ in@@ y Euro@@ wings should be developed as independent as possible .
in the board team at the Chef Car@@ sten Spo@@ hr in the future Karl Ulrich Sh@@ aud will be responsible for the Euro wings in the future .
&quot; with the new record , Spo@@ hr scores the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group will continue to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet , in the future . &quot;
&quot; to date , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airline group , under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group , placed three quarters of the 2013 annual turnover of € 30 billion . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can not play on monthly due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , a double fixing of his right B@@ one . &quot;
&quot; as this led to the left external pun@@ ches to tears , and close to it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope to play the hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w in the PS@@ V area was broken . &quot;
he was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double Rhin@@ op@@ lasty and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will then move tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then re @-@ operate in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very difficult and then everything is going on . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I am not a doctor , but if you have a double correction , it will take six months and he will not play in group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the suspension of an elite .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al affir@@ med that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , when I say that a me@@ ter@@ meter and a red card may be required . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws Account : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words can not describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I &apos;ll come back more strongly . &quot;
right : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at the PS@@ V
&quot; the England @-@ Defen@@ ders has an additional incentive in France with the European Championship in France , to recover as far as the next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury then all are very sad about it .
it &apos;s never the intention of our players to hurt a opponent .
Mor@@ eno has suffered a mis@@ sal when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent and if you then hear that it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was on the road in a different direction , so it looked like he &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; touched him , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking with S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard this can be . &quot;
I feel very poor with me . I &apos;m sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also brought into hospital - after a oul@@ try by Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not last long before you get it very agile . &quot;
&quot; unless that , you may be David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite orph@@ an &apos;s book was asked , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , published in 1971 on the occasion of Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company &apos;s Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems always a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposed to describe the story of the book , instead a summar@@ izing the movie version of 2012 which added new characters and details added to the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; amidst the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a good , hopes to see a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , &quot; &quot; reads &quot; &quot; his desire to see a real tree , his real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss ho@@ stage and died in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this isn &apos;t yet da@@ zz@@ ling enough : the text presented by Cameron presented here partly as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film that &apos;s presented on the website of Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he adm@@ its to being a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the monetary gre@@ edy , blo@@ oming , kn@@ ur@@ ped creatures , &quot; &quot; which is in the name of the trees &quot; &quot; devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR assignment has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who has not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times succes@@ sively for a child . &quot;
&quot; a down@@ ing @-@ street speaker said , the text probably came from Mr Cameron &apos;s constitu@@ ent office . &quot;
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was provided by Mr Cameron , but gave no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion of England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult . &quot;
&quot; to race Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you chose the Ka@@ der , whom England has chosen for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 Test series not on my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward appearance .
&quot; A@@ vel@@ air C@@ ooks page is possibly less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the batt@@ ing system , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not carry any s@@ cars from 2012 , only a you@@ thful and positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball developed Mo@@ een Ali as Spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an un@@ familiar size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
according to this message : Adam Ly@@ th sli@@ pped from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to let Adam Ly@@ th is of course for me as its chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but harsh reality is that crime players are aligned with results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question signs at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination - and I said this to players their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
if he hopefully hits more purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire comes a further chance .
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not deliver such good performances , and this does not surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test perc@@ ei@@ man receives to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th has received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ sons , before him - , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine was nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the opportunity to play home and post @-@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can rise up , was that England was at first Jonathan in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost occasion is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a stroke that I appreciate highly . &quot;
&quot; he is a X @-@ factor cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he reached 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; it must be at least the same opportunities as before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mor@@ een next to Cook , which would yield an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ cks , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there and this link@@ age has already shown that he is a vi@@ cious of cri@@ cket players .
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not get his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for her , and there is no difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played its first 38 tests in the first Drop before he began in 2001 as Open@@ er .
he was immediately managed and looked back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari arrives in the Ka@@ der as Back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited use with him , he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
people may see his statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a Pun@@ t but there is no large number of back@@ ers who rise their hands and the coaches have chosen for youth .
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainers . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ ing , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a master . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys of the game , who will bring an abundance of experience , since he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
&quot; Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood comes for the white ball stage of the tour , and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup . &quot;
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as Coach , and like Mah@@ ela he gives insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air , even if the messages are in accordance with the previously predicted . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , will not be inserted at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break to Australia and I do not have a problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and team members do not determine the timing . &quot;
and you must think that as with players their jobs are depend on the results .
such decisions are made no easy heart .

&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ equi@@ vocal strategy to keep Britain in the EU every day , even without the vote of the &quot; Jer@@ emy &quot; &quot; is Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n , the leader of Labour or TU@@ C , who suffered violent due to Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at today told that some member states , so deeply shocked in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always from the own debt , Britain itself created agenda with split off concessions and annoying contractual changes that they mostly do not want . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , a TU@@ C decided on her annual meeting that it may not be able to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers have climbing up summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a picture of himself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say they will win allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wish to look into the r@@ un@@ iting Britain in the inside of the EU celebration - &quot; Don &apos;t alone say to France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets you see that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter if we remain or go . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel is one ally spoken , but she has been in power for 10 years , but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks bad for her , as it is for the exagger@@ ated long exc@@ elling such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France François Hollande can look forward to his re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a pale power .
Poland possibly soon have a nation@@ alistic rights government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will be cur@@ sed up a leg to aid the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s ex@@ iting from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies are to be . &quot;
&quot; therefore , perhaps some such ministers may even be inten@@ tionally not helpful comment , completely in the SN@@ P @-@ style , during the press release in 2017 , to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boyfriend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain has not won anything of its ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and what EU scep@@ tics proposed the oligarchy of the press , but did not support our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 supported . &quot;
&quot; they can remember being weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro Opport@@ un@@ ists who made a name for himself as an &quot; EU bar@@ ley ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; in all his de@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; the med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing circuits , telephone s@@ h@@ ack@@ ings and pseudo @-@ merchants , have also included the majority of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair as much thought about her , but stood firm that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage you &apos;ll find better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ i@@ ri@@ cally opposed to Blair as he had opposed Mr Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Blair had rejected the principle of the not passed by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened to him a door door . &quot;
the press has never mis@@ led him .
&quot; but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly lace on my back on Monday - I told him that he no longer need more time for me to waste in danger - seems to be in danger , N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ k@@ ott would repeat 80 @-@ s years , an error then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC bro@@ ker he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s official position on Europe - I put it friendly - in development .
&quot; &quot; &quot; he says that we should stay in a reform@@ ist EU . &quot;
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ark@@ ic tendency and the willing Ge@@ fil@@ ths of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Brit@@ ons can probably say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; A petrol , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week , &quot; &quot; when the boy sc@@ outs strug@@ gled in him , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ men &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as shadow cler@@ ical was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ er years , when his old father stro@@ ve for it to be loyal to his Labour cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight , to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Ben@@ ns expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell told , still what J@@ C told its collaborators and members of all reports on their Kl@@ ur@@ ur@@ ung on Monday night . &quot;
whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants - remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains in the age of TV 24 hours important and above all in the Stru@@ thof of Social Media , a brood @-@ site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is correct to give Cameron not a free ticket for Europe who per@@ mitting him to maintain Lab@@ ours &apos;s support in the wake @-@ around campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly think so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities in the EU membership , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents for which the an@@ sm is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son , fel@@ low@@ ly convinced that J@@ C will not launch a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin be wast@@ ing political capital - they have mis@@ sp@@ ill voters - to make com@@ promises to the British when it can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction from the T@@ ory government to power that I was called on Monday from something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze report by Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes should be less harmful than smoking emerged from a meeting of 12 persons , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) who critic@@ ised The Lanc@@ et by making them critic@@ ised by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes .
p@@ he published the &quot; key@@ note report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the ability of data , and transferred to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal For@@ et last month seized the &quot; exceptionally win@@ dy foundation &quot; on the p@@ he finished his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked if the claims can be built on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor for Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to create a model for multiple criteria decision @-@ decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of various nicotine hal@@ ogen@@ ated products in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to the public @-@ public health in a sustainability report .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes producers , but not the financing that he should have received after reports before the tobacco company Philip Morris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the body are not delivered , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include one sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco testing .
at the meeting also the min@@ it@@ ry of p@@ he took part .
&quot; the research in the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; &quot; it was evidence that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most of the products , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; there were no evidence that there were no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes could serve as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that on the alleg@@ ations of BM@@ J was already re@@ acted . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are essentially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ time smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
all evidence suggest@@ ing that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes compared to that are minor but that we continue to study the long term effects .
&quot; he has made clear duty to inform the public about what evidence is eviden@@ ced and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative risks when compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die yearly at a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health system two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear preference of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ Fin@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should cease to send programs such as East@@ entities and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit @-@ shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ casting fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC , that they are considered public @-@ legal programmes which are probably seen by a smaller audience , ranked in hard disputed time window against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and from sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; once the BBC chief executive , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he has tried six years in his time at Channel 4 without success in contact with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have had problems with the idea that BBC offers order or sends , which would also be clearly shown by no subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; said Johnson the Ober@@ haus @-@ communications Committee under his investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broad@@ cast@@ ers , which I consider medium or long term not for a good idea , one should at least give up your production to programmes , the other do not make or order . &quot;
&quot; they send The Voice in a first class window , because they want to achieve the widest possible support for their future . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it &apos;s natural nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ ression tax was financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ Fin@@ ders is another , admittedly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would give your right arm to it . &quot;
I am trying to see how this must be public @-@ law TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a entrepreneurs for series , led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for hunting for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to maintain long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows on the BBC show that which was the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart lecture in 2003 , suggested that the BBC shows , such as East@@ entities . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public legal programs &quot; said to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where one can &apos;t measure the public , but they fulfil their tasks , and they can argue if they have created their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion Euros , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a window in which nobody ever wanted to see them .
&quot; for the broad@@ casting , Johnson said the board : &quot; I call you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course you think all , we think that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year , but for people who is for the 150 £ a lot of money , wonder if that is true because they consume not much from the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief President David El@@ stein , who also said before the Tuesday Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to evaluate their r@@ th@@ ian mission to form and maintain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that there are 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take a look at the public @-@ legal channels in Australia and Canada , for example , to inform and chat . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television is shown to make everything available online . &quot;
&quot; son@@ o@@ Dream &quot; can control brain cells through sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ hold will change the direction in the moment , in which it will be be@@ amed with sound impul@@ sive . &quot;
scientists have bred the wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems which can be controlled by o@@ aks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny ne@@ at@@ ability change the direction in the moment in which they have heard with sound impul@@ sion , which have too high frequencies for human hearing , in order to be heard . &quot;
the impulses work through switching on Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ ound waves .
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ int@@ ents , where ultras@@ ound may be used to activ@@ ating a range of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the proceedings of one day could replace the depths of the brain in the stimulation of Par@@ kinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; Finn@@ s are usually not responding to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves , which then enter into the thro@@ ws . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound @-@ waves operate on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membran@@ es used by some of the seas@@ oning cells .
&quot; sound waves make an opening of these ion channels , and activate the cells to which they are associated with such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ ato@@ den , genetically as@@ ani genetically modified the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ones TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when he leaves ultras@@ ound to the changed creatures , the sound waves are reinforced by the micro@@ bes and transferred to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the modified mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ graphs , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to create neur@@ ons with impulse of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ tells you may have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent from an optical fiber to the desired place in the brain can be un@@ brid@@ led , can be un@@ low frequency @-@ ultras@@ ound tissue and can so be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the inherited human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic corporate inheritance , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colors and animation it remains more powerful . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in school residence
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as self @-@ for@@ ged 19 @-@ year @-@ old into a student dor@@ m , but I still remember the sm@@ iled sm@@ iles who I have been anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ lasting discomfort of others . &quot;
&quot; most of what I have learned , can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules . &quot;
the de@@ duction of students resi@@ des from slightly nerve wr@@ acking up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to sh@@ ew , to tell people wh@@ ence you come , where and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ on , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are &quot; honestly , Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just an issue of yeast ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to find out people that would like you as opposed to those you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your eyelashes were so@@ aked in fire and that fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people do .
&quot; the rooms of people often turn into beverages , film festivals and municipal meetings , but they are also the places where people wear and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
referred to : do not remember to start at the university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a rough handling at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residences form a space @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be friendly and social and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
that can be hell for someone who is trying to relax .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will keep going away that our friendship continues , but you have to go away so that I have used the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a class@@ mates is exhausted from convi@@ vi@@ ality - and send him an SMS instead of knock .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
a guy in my student &apos;s homes had the idea that a non @-@ closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship by b@@ aking .
&quot; as you start the university at the height of the back @-@ man@@ ia , the clo@@ cking at the doors of people is imag@@ ining it with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd as the welcome from 1950 @-@ er years &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I asked you something to bake . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to entertain yourself and will eventually turn your face with a delicious surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent B@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed cl@@ umps of flour , sugar and gre@@ ase lead to people asleep to sleep , if you drop anchor . &quot;
ste@@ al food is a common crime in student homes .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
vali@@ date it with the owner &apos;s owner .
&quot; the chances are good , they say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; when somebody is ste@@ aling up your stuff , this is annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a sink to your milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise of the people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you are in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ ted to man who are sitting in the glass building . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , whether it turns out to them something , drum &amp; bass something qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to this with still smar@@ ter music .
&quot; when she finally heard about 5 p.m. , she sent her neighbors to sleep 2 hours before she closed her own music , closed her door and went on to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would move random@@ ly to the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; the other way around , it would not be very embarrassing if you consider a room@@ mate for your future marriage , to turn into them again and see it every day and maybe experience how they over@@ run all common friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own paths - but if a name is room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to talk a little reason to your under@@ dog . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his key in his un@@ closed room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bullying are more than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good trick is funny , but it only takes moments until he is bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
give a plug a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but don &apos;t miss someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door , and put your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but push its possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , all@@ ein@@ opping , t@@ ear@@ ners , for@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
&quot; the real estate service Markus Gil@@ dner builds up in the Middle @-@ ro@@ que , corner @-@ house @-@ houses for people who don &apos;t have much money . &quot;
&quot; for instance , about refugees - but also as a signal , &quot; &quot; not only refugees need to be living room , but also the alone @-@ extrac@@ ting mother and the t@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I am showing how to get even today cheap and well @-@ built today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will thr@@ ong the housing market .
the entrepreneurs Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds on a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner : many refugees will thr@@ ong the housing market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass @-@ mass accommodation in containers or sne@@ e@@ ders has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we also need a living space in the coming decades . &quot;
a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs a least seat .
it makes the integration .
this is different when one sub@@ blocks the people in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses built just in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
the houses can be modified easily according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is built on 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without property . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six month has taken the construction .
this is appropriate .
do the construction requirements have their plans complicated ?
Gil@@ dner : from legally I dra@@ gged my project correctly .
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ min@@ ent Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ aber special structure and the space @-@ space . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still under construction , which creates three apartments in a row @-@ house , needs at least three locations . &quot;
only in the cities is missing the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the people react to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were those who have thrown over me , lux@@ uries for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but do not even exac@@ erb@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true is : we have had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but were built by luxury apartments , which cannot afford a little more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary human being . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the alone @-@ extrac@@ ting mother or the ear@@ ners . &quot;
I am showing how to build a good and safe place today .
therefore it is all about .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the launch @-@ app , click &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; software update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the telephone gives you the option to download and then install install . &quot;
&quot; some are pushed to problems after installation , since they obtain an error message that exp@@ ires the &quot; software update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ navigate the problem , users are advised to either wait until the rush is going back or trying to update over iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself takes you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may also mean del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it easier to do this through the ti@@ ghtening of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do so if you use a special tool using apps , and then install them anew as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s worth to make sure your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is close to a char@@ charger , so that the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the cargo is too low , Apple will not allow the update to be continued , as the phone could possibly down@@ turn out half way and could result in a break@@ up of the updates . &quot;

Qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ office is looking for direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Alten@@ Centre Anton@@ isti@@ ft have joined forces in the Mant@@ le of the Social Foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
&quot; in addition to consultations , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the social foundation goes down from the mountain to the city centre .
more specifically to the Count St@@ auff@@ enberg site .
there was recently opened a new qu@@ ad office .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , from now seniors and advice seeking information on issues such as care insurance or to services of health and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have been established with our out@@ patient care service , that often nursing depend@@ ents are left alone . &quot;
there are endless possibilities to answer .
&quot; also , too many services of the cas@@ hes are not used , because the complexity of insur@@ ances are hardly understood , &quot; said the new house@@ holder in Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , who is responsible as a business unit for geri@@ atic care and also for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ deus . &quot; &quot;
&quot; besides the meetings , the new qu@@ arti@@ ll@@ office offers also prevention , health care and wellness . &quot;
this was taken by the Sal@@ u@@ dis by boat .
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as tor@@ e@@ prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers of the retirement centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis is for prevention , precaution and Reh@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the retirement centre for care and care , &quot; described He@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , chair@@ men of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new qu@@ ad office in the city centre are both business leaders especially demographic change .

men inspec@@ tors on 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses seeks the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den in direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called for them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT gas station .
on the premises of the gas station there are also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and hit the face of this man with his fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a nas@@ al da@@ wning and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends came about ha@@ vo@@ iced and con@@ forming to the r@@ ack@@ et , he first took away from his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the last young man was brought home now .
the off@@ ender followed the group with a vehicle up to the apartment and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times gone .
&quot; when you saw the vehicle no more , the injured went outside the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person .
&quot; under the help of a p@@ unch , you test on the face and the victim &apos;s thi@@ ghs . &quot;
the wounded had to be transferred to a hospital for medical care .
until now there is only one v@@ ague project description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 metres in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been around 1.@@ 65 metres tall and was cloth@@ ed with jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of ri@@ vals and invested € 3@@ 10000 Euro
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ir@@ gh@@ ausen .
&quot; moreover , Sam@@ ba &apos;s co @-@ par@@ ishes Bernd Bor@@ mann , econom@@ ist Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : there will be Dr Frank Müller on the 1st of October the practice of Fel@@ ris@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; during the UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ig@@ ausen in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on his side in the coming months , with half a passage . &quot;
&quot; after a re@@ construction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he will invest 3@@ 10000 Euro in the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l met , who currently held their technical education in the Lili@@ a hospital and come into practice after the year . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the id@@ les would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ir@@ gh@@ ausen and lau@@ ghing . &quot;
&quot; when it was set , I simply inv@@ oked it . &quot;
&quot; the couple of Müller , Müller dropped the idea , in future in A@@ sen@@ dorf , to practice its own practice . &quot;
&quot; the proximity and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he will soon be able to be his own boss . &quot;
and so one was unified , the trav@@ eller bought the house with practice . &quot;
living will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there the twice family @-@ father Frank Müller also grew up , his medical degree in Hannover , followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; currently he is active as a chief physician in Sul@@ ingen , he was also appointed to the Chief Private Hospital in the district of Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen Vil@@ sen . &quot;
from 19 September the practice for the new boss will be prepared .
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ir@@ ausen as a primary care specialist , his spouse has specialised in gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to settle as home users . &quot;
&quot; end@@ os@@ copy therefore comes out , &quot; &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will look like modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations and long @-@ term and durability @-@ EK@@ GS and need a consultancy room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is also completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a total of 50@@ 000 Euro is produced by the Mü@@ llers in part of a funding programme ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) , as well as from the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continuing , &quot; says Sam@@ er @-@ coordinated Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , each quarter come into practice in the practice of Fel@@ ting Forces , in the North American A@@ xis , about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ir@@ gh@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , she would have gone . &quot;
who visits &apos;s Expert Consul@@ tation by the way continues to look especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power of the rock .
&quot; with their par@@ ting farewell in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all the doctors worked there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ir@@ gh@@ ausen varied . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y it felt after the long time already .
&quot; but we live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly see many people , &quot; the Inter@@ nis@@ ine says . &quot;
your husband will add l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; hitherto I have always pushed against gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; besides , the pair has two grandchildren and travels gladly . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls also went on to our south @-@ border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain united in parallel .
&quot; still be clear that anyone who wants to put a asylum application , this can also be &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
the main focus is on the care and safety of people .
&quot; it is clear , however , that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , not even over the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia has refused
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia &apos;s ongoing refugees leave for Austria and Germany and may also create cor@@ ridors for refugees .
this then saw the Interior in Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; &quot; Slovenia is rather to intensify the border on the border - in particular to Hungary - intensify . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already very controlled by the border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ ians wants to set out its limits to refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function &quot; &quot; stressed Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; like the Croatian government , the first refugees have already tried in the night hours to Tuesday , in Eastern Croatian , on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d to avoid the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack it in the near future fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik mo@@ an constantly meeting police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is mostly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including many women and children . &quot;
also life@@ guard and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country will be reck@@ oned with around 4,000 refugees , Minister of Interior , Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pres@@ evo placed at the Maced@@ onian border , which have now led to migrants to the Hungarian border , in the direction of Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but the government in Belgrade , however , that it is the people to propose certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we do nor want to do this , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports at any rate , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border town of Si@@ d , during the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the in@@ mates were the whole night on the way around 500 kilometres away from the Maced@@ onian border in Serbia .
&quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police said that we are going to go here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , it could actually be a shift to EU @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Macedonia @-@ Hungary to a slightly farther north @-@ eastern course of observers . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive ways to border check &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees , corresponding plans for potential exc@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; he did not , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive ways to limit control . &quot; &quot;
conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been one of the EU partners since 2007 , and since then we have consistently committed a solid testimony to the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Hungarian border , some 300 refugees continue to be stuck on the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Bel@@ grave media , she would have spent the past night at the crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border transi@@ tions of Hor@@ gos and B@@ i Bre@@ g continue to remain completely blocked . &quot;
if the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic sought to so@@ ot@@ he himself at a local stage in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would be no time for very high refugees .
&quot; one could not say whether they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia , or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugees have already started to distribute to the refugees of maps , in which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in some parts of the bor@@ der@@ land , there are even 20 years after the end of the Croatian war that still sp@@ inn@@ ate min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police had announced that a team of de@@ mining was sent in the border region .

the en@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es made aware of this action on her 20 @-@ year anniversary and clearly sees itself with mixed reactions .
&quot; it is about life , so with this action we went in the middle of the city and under the people , &quot; says Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the leader of the en@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ai@@ ding stands for the pas@@ sers just as well for questions and discussions as the volunteers .
&quot; while some Pas@@ sover acc@@ esses a t@@ ant spontaneously to the chal@@ k and to continue the phrase &quot; &quot; my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; read &quot; &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; stop &quot; &quot; the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; do not suffer too long , &quot; &quot; say &quot; &quot; I &apos;m still not &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again on the ver@@ ge , there are little discussion about the action in itself , about life , the use with the dying . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only when I make sure that for me at the end of this world , I am acting responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the director of the di@@ ac@@ onian work of Mannheim , working together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ hic carrier of the en@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action is good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wants to communicate openly on the tablets , but whether it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death was aff@@ licted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , although particularly helped the Hosp@@ es movement in recent years to open a lot to people . &quot;

the death of the O@@ bit@@ u@@ aries is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; faced by personal income with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ es were sought by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was part of the foundation in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ i belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the sufferers and relatives of private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and in hosp@@ ice @-@ Vincent . &quot;
all are they carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ i can work well with her job and the experiences and experiences made .
&quot; I see life from another war@@ es , keep it for precious , and appreciate the moment &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient en@@ cum@@ en@@ ism is free of charge and denomin@@ ational .
financial support for the health insurance and donations of relatives and associations allows the training as well as advanced training and supervision of the eu@@ than@@ asia .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed with financial prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappointing outcome for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ gi@@ ant lowered his winner of an entire year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his bo@@ d@@ bed service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to hire about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share decreased over 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit from 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May next , 20 c@@ ents less than in the previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts got expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view despite the price increases , which is an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective 4 January and despite a higher rainf@@ all for worldwide transfer of heavy and large packages , which will be accumulated from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said , however , that it expects the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company brings &quot; solid yields if people are weaker than expected economic conditions , above all in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than those of the Rival U@@ PS , which is planning to susp@@ end 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional labour force , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex had earned a total of $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the result per share stood at $ 2,@@ 42 per share , just behind the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research interviewed analysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks interviewed analysts expecting € 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has shown a decline in international primary energy shipping within the last few years that will st@@ agn@@ ate sales in his unit express shipping .
but the boom in online shopping has raised the results with F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the final quarter , sales increased by 29 percent in the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat for higher packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit has declined higher revenue due to higher rates , whereas the result is declined because of higher labour costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares amoun@@ ted around 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent of the year and 17 per cent at a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at its most expected meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 foot @-@ ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to up@@ lift it for the first time since almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a g@@ man@@ t on them at the end of the dedicated , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat sa@@ ws is a m@@ ural by the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed Chair Jan@@ et L. Y@@ elles and its colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ izing U.S. employment and prices here stable .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have recognised that there is a terrible third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
&quot; this third mandate could be the X @-@ factor in a decision that is too tight to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday , whether the US economy is ready to be reconc@@ iled by an unprecedented stimul@@ ant for the close @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ences in the global financial markets could be frightened to increase these volati@@ lity in the interest rates of federal government - and be it only around one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing they watch , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists at the Mak@@ ler@@ company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not raise the interest rate , the increased insecurity on the global market is justification , further to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which is uncertain due to the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists who have recently interviewed by Bloomberg have been predic@@ ated a tax increase this week .
&quot; the financial markets are expecting a waiting of the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance at an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increased the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow , by promising that further increase is far away . &quot;
on Tuesday the Dow Jones Industrial aver@@ aged around 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 .
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy continues the sentence in this week , John Lon@@ sky , chief of Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would lift the propositions at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do so , they need to go very far in their explanation to calm the financial markets , so that they should not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a tax increase would so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets , because they will take uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percent@@ ages in this month , the first little step in a slow ti@@ ghtening of the monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in spring and early summer , that in this year , despite the complaints from Liber@@ als , I would expect more economic progress to increase its proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , the improvement of the labour market was substantial . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank to 5.4 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level that the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly declined under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason the temporary effect of much lower oil prices said . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can manage higher interest rates and requires them because of tension on the labour market , &quot; Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief Econom@@ ist and Pantheon Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world looked together at the end of the last month after China claimed its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial average was worth more than 16 % under its peak , as investors afraid that a slo@@ wing down the Chinese economy would turn the global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market is reco@@ vering slightly this month , whereby the Dow is now around 10 % below the period of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al impact the complex calculation , when it would increase rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events occurred on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy in the last few weeks , they would put on re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ lining , Senior Research Fel@@ low on the U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former staff of the US staff . &quot;
he is predicted that she will wait at least one month to better control the impact .
&quot; there are a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the U.S. economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; says O@@ str@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be involved in their decision making making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed monetary authority of the world has become . &quot;
the influence of the central bank in recent years was huge .
&quot; the mere comment of the former director Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 shows that the F@@ ed could &quot; &quot; narrow &quot; &quot; expansion &quot; &quot; solved con@@ fu@@ sions around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ isted can be expected of the F@@ ed representatives , they can not only monitor the developments in other central banks but also consult with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of global economy . &quot;
&quot; decision making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary car@@ ab@@ ell , director of the global strategy for asset management of the company En@@ cour@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , which appear to be associated with their economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; tr@@ acker , voting single member of the Federal Open Market Committee , advocates for a inser@@ ting increase , cited in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions &quot; despite limited recognition effects on growth in the U.S. &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed @-@ representatives released these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put on the first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the period in the period in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the committee for the interest of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the most recent turbul@@ ences do not come to the proximity of this level , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to enter into the situation in which they are afraid of a raise , because the markets themselves , &quot; &quot; said Posen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; Federal Reserve Act still does not contain the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until this has been changed , I do not believe it should hurry ahead . &quot;
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinatown .
&quot; yes , Chinatown
the market / warehouse was established in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often known as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai retail market that is also sold to the general public .
&quot; yes , he is located in Chinatown and not in the Thai Town . &quot;

the store is huge and it takes over an hour to stroll through the veins .
&quot; if the whole shopping you are hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the cooking area ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the K@@ assen and has various reviews options .
what it is here : do you need something - anything - Thai language ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
&quot; more and more refugees arrive in Germany , this day . &quot;
&quot; prepare a warm welcome , not without the engagement of innumerable volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are quite a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
among them are Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 sequences , they are still being taught . &quot;
&quot; every Thursday , she does it in asylum @-@ seekers at the D@@ ill@@ inger Street . &quot;
&quot; there it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the whole of other teaching is one of the right schools . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pedi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes food for healthy breastfeeding
the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tried to clear the women in shocking how important good food during the lac@@ tation period is . she does this with the presentation of images of babies which are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers come to raising their daily cal@@ orie intake about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation to the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a current study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet for women in fact affects the genes of their babies and protects it from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
unfortunately a healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system .
a few exceptions for the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the nearby Bern@@ ried approved the building yield of the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar system .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around of the sport grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent EU council meeting , the developed construction application was lowered without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the panel was still under a request for a &quot; &quot; respectable &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; from the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; apart from the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was intended to obtain permission for a special form with respect to the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a &quot; &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ intermediate first and roof top &quot; &quot; should be established . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the planned use of the roof space for solar power : &quot; &quot; we get together a wonderful big sw@@ ab@@ ah , &quot; stated Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; liberation &quot; &quot; again , in turn , we went around the roofs , which is required for energy reasons - other than in the building plan , must lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall will be significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan had not allowed any &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bernstein of the council generally for@@ wards with liber@@ ations more restric@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the athle@@ tic building at the sports centre is a collaborative project of the community and S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
around 2.3 million euros have been calculated .
subsidies are expected from the school and grass@@ roots talent .
the next process of procedure for the 18 x 36 metres long hall now has to be submitted for the exam .
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg should be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be appointed as CEO of Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of the staff members moved from P@@ ei@@ ran berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this presents the surprising plans of hospital GmbH in the district of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cils Andrea Bi@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board , however , made a decision for the Supervisory Board and the conven@@ ing on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the vast majority sol@@ les with fishermen and the continued inside station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the spaces are available .
&quot; the employees who cannot work with Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , such as Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff are informed about their plans .
&quot; triggered the change from Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been at the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now moving to a private office in close proximity of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to follow the succession , came to Jo@@ chner @-@ White , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who volunte@@ ered to take the direction from 1 October and to switch with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this was a &quot; appreciation &quot; and an exchange of the offer in the area of &quot; internal medicine , &quot; such as yod@@ elling . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station of gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; over the next two years Fischer will take over for the next two years , with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree both of the houses , next year , the former hospital of the child , which has over 35 beds , has been closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the County had planned this for 2018 if the currently running rest@@ aur@@ ation is completed by the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; in the future , Land@@ s@@ tin Jo@@ chner @-@ White , who also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , entered into account that the house , which is owned by the federal republic , will in future be used as an accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the end I close . &quot; as with the real estate , Jo@@ chner @-@ White could not say , there are several reflections . &quot;
currently there are a short @-@ time press of Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ ph@@ etry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an occasion does not come again , &quot; says Fischer about the Qu@@ asi @-@ Mo@@ ve to the Le@@ ch , who had been received by employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where fishermen have worked as Princip@@ al doctor for more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was repeatedly threatened by closing , departments were closed , for example surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the Hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are required tonight ( 20.@@ 15 PM ) in the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight .

hun@@ ites with two injured in Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ des@@ men have been seriously har@@ med during their corn @-@ afternoon by shots .
&quot; during the Aber@@ rant on a ma@@ is@@ feld near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police broke . &quot;
after a casting suffered a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
&quot; however , how exactly it could come to the accident , was initially unclear . &quot;
the criminal poli@@ cem@@ an obtained .
lost 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pf@@ alz victims of non @-@ violent
a susp@@ ens@@ ory has led the police to the sur@@ est of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ ro@@ gue , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was killed , the young people killed and their cor@@ pse thrown into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
one since Saturday I missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a non@@ violent crime to the victim .
&quot; the young lady &apos;s gul@@ f was found at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern in the evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , like public pro@@ secutor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a tat@@ too , a recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ olds also applies to the indication , according to him , and carried the investig@@ ator to the place of discovery of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was ever missed on Sunday morning after she hadn &apos;t settled on the eve for a visit of autumn in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen as agreed home .
when searching for the young woman the investig@@ ator first came to offering personal belon@@ gings .
in the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the bl@@ ur@@ led eventually a scene arose against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
of the mut@@ ed offen@@ ders then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the cor@@ pse was found .
&quot; the applause gave the authorities to the police , who were killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the cor@@ pse in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be fought the o@@ ath on Wednesday , investig@@ ators put the carrying bow to his burden . &quot;
&quot; of course , the further investigation shall be brought to the further investigation . &quot;
refugees needed accommodations : study warning against apartment
the location on the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution of the German housing market had long since begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and people seeking from outside the EU , more and more people are emerging onto a market that is already over@@ bur@@ dened in many cities . &quot;
they compete with one @-@ sided barriers to the final paid apartments .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , would need to produce 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; to this end a study comes in the mandate of the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by comparison , we have had a total of 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units in Germany . &quot;
&quot; that there are 14@@ ,000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer obliged to stay in the first three months of their stay , for asylum seekers in the first half of their stay . &quot;
many then come across the apartment market and join in the long queu@@ es before the rent .
&quot; according to the Statisti@@ cal Federal Institute , however , less than half of all asylum seekers have tended to rent . &quot;
the negative trend in the housing market is not only for the rising refugee numbers .
the study also makes significant failures in the housing construction of recent years .
Germany &apos;s going to be a housing deficit in front of it which gets bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , in the metropolitan areas already have been around 77@@ ,000 units , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals were therefore living in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults stayed because of the flu@@ ff on the apartment market un@@ inten@@ tionally longer in the &quot; Hotel M@@ om . &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per capita in the past few years has fallen back for the first time . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; proposes a new start . &quot;
the aim is to boost new incentives to social housing .
this could be avoided on the land amount tax and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments may be abandoned .
&quot; in addition , the alliance is an attractive form @-@ off @-@ order solution . &quot;
the Förder@@ Programme for Refu@@ ge@@ es of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well attended by cities and villages .
&quot; a good week after the start , the Monday night with 18@@ 4 million Euro had already been called up around 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are aimed at corridor
&quot; after Hungary there is practically no going through , then more and more refugees pick the road through Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passing through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighboring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I talked with the Sloven@@ ian interior ministers and when it is necessary we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already one of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not yet a Schengen area .
&quot; after the de@@ preci@@ ation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees left to Croatia to get there from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian inter@@ sen@@ ile RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had cut off its border for refugees on Monday .
&quot; new laws , which occurred on the same day , take excessive asylum procedures in Hungary as practically superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to leave the refugees .
Croatian prime minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; you can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who live and want to achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police had picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the EU &apos;s neighbouring country . &quot;
&quot; most of the articles were reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they reached both by bus and Ta@@ xen in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival she was temp@@ ted to walk through the green border to Croatia .
&quot; while on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border , refugees arrive at the border . &quot;
&quot; that is , the limit stri@@ pe leads to other dangers . there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
de@@ mining companies can now quickly create a secure passage .
after the closing of the border no more refugees arrive after the closing of the border .
on Tuesday the police officers were attacked by 3@@ 66 .
shortly before the gate on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws are to overcome and damaging the border as criminal off@@ ences .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were introduced in the Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
&quot; the ruling body rests , up to five years , and the deportation from the country . &quot;
&quot; according to the Im@@ migrants authority , one went on Tuesday to the newly appointed &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sh@@ ons &quot; &quot; on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important transition R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning there were still 40 refugees left there .
&quot; practically , no one has a view to granted asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the di@@ so@@ wned asylum seekers should be ported from the top .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; transit zone &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to break down .
they gathered the trash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the past weeks at the road@@ side .
barrier Gri@@ ds have been reduced and one of the charts in the bor@@ der@@ land was changed .
&quot; to the purpose of this construction , nobody wanted to express . &quot;
&quot; Austria , after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , only a few refugees arrive . &quot;
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were left to government , but still in the country . &quot;
about 1400 people are waiting for travel to Germany in Salzburg .
the train transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of German authorities .
&quot; in free@@ wheel , there were a regular smaller groups of refugees on foot . &quot;
mayor running a &quot; str@@ anded &quot; on the border
&quot; we were busy after the for@@ ge on Sunday with the place , when suddenly ten people were standing at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ as Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists staying by train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; on Sunday but because Germany accepted the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday but for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , the city , who immediately offered his help and compiled the str@@ anded together with two further hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before , we have only once again verk@@ ö@@ sti@@ gt , with J@@ ause and Be@@ ver@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was self @-@ evident for us , &quot; said City Hall in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take care of , a generous donation - 100 Euro for fire bri@@ ga@@ des . &quot;
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; &quot; said coun@@ c@@ utter . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train toward Pass@@ au , the railway station was gone to Germany after the short notice that the rail transport to Germany was abandoned . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border over@@ stepping is generally high in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ firmly association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , on @-@ day before a two @-@ brid@@ ge@@ board sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án gets more tens of thousands of thousands of us now , is a logical result of virtual policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping build structures in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately near the establishment of structures , our Chancellor continued high officially and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government in the aspir@@ ation of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering from this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the border regions with chaotic states .
&quot; the refugee will have to find that the &quot; &quot; troubled land &quot; &quot; they invited us and welcomed nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will become a great challenge , given the sustained refugee streams and the approaching winter , with us decent conditions for searching for protective seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ rad in search of 3@@ 5.000 and winter@@ proof quarters , &quot;
&quot; finally , Con@@ rad has full hands to do with the refugee base . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government used the earlier powerful Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen Ban@@ ker to raise funds for thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos in the &quot; &quot; Tra@@ is@@ kirchen @-@ Centre &quot; &quot; has already had to handle Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we have no homeless any more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday , was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ crisis situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; all in all , Konrad , with a demand for 8@@ 5,000 quarters in the same year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number in the next few weeks , 3@@ 5.000 accommodations will have to be found - 20,000 ought to provide the countries , 15,000 the covenant . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is no bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the governor , he has already conducted talks . &quot;
they could have promised him for the next refugees as well .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supporting Con@@ rad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born and shall be trans@@ figured as the Church will help .
&quot; great expectations puts the asylum @-@ ordinator as well into the OR@@ F action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps &quot; &quot; as we do . &quot;
on the platform individuals can easily offer accommodations .
it is also hoping for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards of accommodation as &apos; very high .
&quot; in times of times , it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ fic@@ ers must respect a certain height of the hand@@ held war@@ fs or size of the upper dimensions . &quot;
for a temporary time need &quot; need &quot; to apply .
&quot; that he was successful in the opposition to the Interior Ministry , &quot; &quot; presents Konrad with his experience . &quot;
I am an older gentleman who is not without any further face to the face of the fal@@ se@@ hood .
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any costs , as they explained themselves . &quot;
your number of employees want to increase them on three to four .
the own search results has not been successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz in an office .
but obviously there are problems with the approval .
Linz calls for better distribution
&quot; there is no opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena , and Design Centre for placing refugees plans the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , this is not necessary , as people could currently manage to fit these measures , &quot; said Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emergen@@ cies , however , additional locations must be checked for their bar@@ gains . &quot;
criticism of the city &apos;s chief will be critic@@ ised the division of refugees within the state .
other districts also must contribute to their contributions .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
in a longer phone with the Bav@@ arian prime minister N@@ oc@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) the county governor Josef P@@ stir@@ s ( VP ) on Monday the further action on the refugee question has been corro@@ ded .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer gave me assur@@ ances that German boundaries are not sealed off . &quot;
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany continues to be possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
there will be no special fac@@ tions to Germany with refugees in Germany .
but the seekers would however have been brought to Germany with regular trains .
&quot; once again , the other EU member states asked for more increased solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that Austria again leads to the border again from Austria , is a logical consequence &quot; of the action of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
the &quot; restructuring of the &quot; new ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the listed IT @-@ group S &amp; T were drawn , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is intended to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in start @-@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later on which to act .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wishes to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which the fall of Holland promises : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros have been invested by S &amp; T into the plant , 3,@@ 3 million Euros from the Tech@@ Center , one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Confederation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is p@@ onder@@ ing from Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
30 percent of the 2@@ 700 square metres of resi@@ dual space in the building are rented out for more than 40 percent give inquiries .
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ ist opened a second shop in the ar@@ cades
in the new shop Fur@@ la @-@ hand@@ bags are at the center .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta wanted to put a dog wide . &quot;
this venture had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old In@@ hab@@ ist of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ber shop @-@ arcade game . finally , it has now received revenue in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la Shop compared to the shop , in which they sold under another bags , cases , shoes and garments of different manufacturers are now all about Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are from 75 euros . &quot;
&quot; big bags and accessories for up to 500 euros . &quot;
since yesterday the new shop has been in operation .
previously several weeks had been changed .
&quot; but I have long over@@ laid , if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says wide . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a site where only their pur@@ se were to be sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the Only in Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has an Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has moved wide from her mother to the cradle .
&quot; for me , most , when something develops and I can show new trends at reasonable prices . &quot;
why so some woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in tin may be dis@@ car@@ ded but the professional woman cannot answer with last security .
maybe it is because a beautiful pocket is due to each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are named An@@ ders .
this characteristic also connects man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for purification .
&quot; whether it is expressed in a foreign @-@ hostile , journalist , or kno@@ bs in the international crisis policy , the candidate for the U.S. presidential office could be strongly engaged in the electoral campaign . &quot;
and cuts well off .
&quot; it is also registered at the P@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate body comes from . &quot;
&quot; the New Yorker with the F@@ Com@@ promise is many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf , in the wine road . &quot;
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related over -@@ seventy corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election @-@ battle mode . &quot;
the city of Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villagers think about his goal to become more powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they are somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters , it is not so deeply impressed , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous spro@@ uts , in which next to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , which is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) also to word - so with the statement that it would surely also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; though there may be respect for the performance of the family , but also den@@ cial opinion that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; sadly , the nickname , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the circle have , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; &quot; - too high German : the plann@@ er , they say . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ gi@@ ver .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the subsequent grandfather had emigr@@ ated and opened in the USA a pub for gol@@ as min@@ er .
cornerstone of the real estate company were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents was not free of logic : her desire , to return to the homeland , was time to return to the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palat@@ inate belonged to that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because once he was once removed from permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches History and Folklore , Roland Paul , was declared a film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is contrast to the occasionally striking statements of the descendants .
&quot; he has repeatedly talked about the Mexican immigrants in the U.S. and demanded the building of a border dam , in order to sav@@ or illegal immigrants . &quot;
&quot; just as the polar , that is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant Rel@@ ump ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so thousand . &quot; &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; this I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of something like this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit just ended for the church organ that was generally well an@@ gled .
&quot; this can I not imagine myself of Donald &apos;s , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it makes it better , if he did not make the choice , for &quot; he has such a radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws in the USA at the time of his grandfather , would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are interesting topics like him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ a Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , which was interviewed for the Tr@@ ump long , have seen 12 000 bir@@ d@@ ers , also in the USA wor@@ kes the interest . &quot;
the Bav@@ arian municipality Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering &quot; village .
&quot; from the hands of vice @-@ presidents at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ citizen @-@ village received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain@@ e@@ ering &quot; villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the dor@@ m Alpine Club is responsible for the award of the award .
a &quot; mountain@@ e@@ er village &quot; is allowed to have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface should be designated as a protective area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite the attempts of Nine to take the loss of the leadership position at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson &apos;s drive to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report on the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but it has no major shifts in reviews for today . &quot;
the breakfast show of Nine was broadcast by the federal capital as Mal@@ col@@ m gymn@@ as@@ ment the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ Days , was in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international television sets , to which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; the disadvantage of the condition seemed to play no part for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise had an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators at the five main towns , compared to about 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , a slight increase in the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last months the gap has been closed to Sun@@ rise .
&quot; in August today , an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 compared to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the gap between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now , Sun@@ rise in September is at average 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change relate this morning people more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great novel@@ ty for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former seriousness of John to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama on a recently wat@@ ered father , which decides to settle down with its two children off the coast of New Zealand , reaching a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million . &quot;
critics had asked themselves whether Thom@@ son took a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new Quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe resolved on average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 until 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday night , the first half hour from The Ch@@ ase Australia had 5@@ 20,000 spectators and had 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ sea @-@ average at an average of 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that hot @-@ se@@ at will finally compete at 17 : 30 .

the last three agree that Mr. Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
revealing truth un@@ veiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly expos@@ ing who The Bachelor is gaining . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood continues in The Bachelor &apos;s degree , was clo@@ aked in major secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if they are the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we were with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows in the day before coming out of three two , you possibly have given accidentally a reference to who will be the vic@@ tor . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the final on Thursday was sealed
&quot; all three women have been om@@ itted in a ly@@ rical way , why wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humor , ambition and positive outlook as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should come the Woods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; , &quot; her answers to the kill@@ ers could become the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Lin@@ os@@ ki called both quick - except itself - M@@ ack@@ ay , as the best partner for wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from day one .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and met Sam@@ s energies , I noticed that they were quite compatible and I thought it was quite compatible in the whole course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on Earth with two feet on Earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
you feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house visit last week she realized that wood is &quot; &quot; the one &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it was obvious that this is not just a game - I am now att@@ un@@ reserv@@ edly on him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when they were asked , whom wood should choose , if not they , there they were pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent requests to his impressive training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice .
&quot; some coaches had ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank as he lost an angel so lost , as it lost the Aussie Millions Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ ti@@ t on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t , and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show its true face in the locker room after the game .
instead of making his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team encouraged by the mill he encouraged them .
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne also by his press conference , also by his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by Mar@@ teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ pped his ver@@ ap@@ ed catch , and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne is patented in a Pun@@ t , who was restored in the first playing field from the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian poems had hoped for his N@@ FL debut album . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left after the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start into his N@@ FL career
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , one only takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne reported the car@@ ver with his Ori@@ gin Deb@@ stu@@ d in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Sunday en@@ closure of the free voters is conven@@ ed by Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian commune .
&quot; actually , we were completely different aspects . &quot;
but the record attendance of the refugees now also dominates the free voters .
&quot; of course , the subject will seek asylum from clo@@ ister , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of UNO protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as she gave them during the Nazi war in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; that is how it goes on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free Par@@ liam@@ ents &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to delay the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts that are responsible for asylum ; &quot; &quot; we need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W CEO critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder will not be consistent : &quot; we bre@@ eder nationwide standards of federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts off , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more able @-@ able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the provincial government should not fall under the table in the big wall@@ papers . &quot;

but this is not far enough to Ai@@ wan@@ ger .
&quot; the topic of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
&quot; we demand freedom of choice for all g@@ ymnasi@@ ums , which they want . &quot;

4 people killed after poli@@ c@@ emen shoot on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in southern Nepal , after the police fired up in a crowd of crowds due to the proposed new constitution , a be@@ amer on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , around 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading district officers , said that over 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , some of you dump@@ ed stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said : the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and then shot into the air before she resum@@ ed on rubber @-@ stories .
&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the g@@ fabri@@ cated rubber @-@ stories , known from which they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently a so high death rate produced . &quot;
&quot; the examination was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal , southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ras@@ i are saying that new provinces , which would be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution to reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ ar@@ u who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people including 11 police officers , have been in violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; in August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , divided the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; working on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators took the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the legis@@ lature is designed for this week on certain cl@@ auses relating to the Constitutional Court in Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction in the city planned
the land at the Em@@ der youth centre Alte Post is to be established again .
the city is currently preparing all for the marketing of the 4000 m2 area .
&quot; it is planned to be a mixture of trade , commerce and living , but there is still no concrete offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - the city Em@@ den wants to market a round 4000 m @-@ square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; waiting for corresponding offers , say it on the part of the city . &quot;
&quot; which investor @-@ question come , is not yet clear . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were closed either . &quot;
&quot; the town Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the ring road / corner Great Street , bought a few months ago and can easily det@@ ach the building that is located . &quot;

the investor was publicly presented for the project for the first time .
many stimul@@ ants are worried - they fear the selling of their leisure
&quot; Mon@@ el@@ ang was behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ed and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new cottage settlement are near the small beach near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ der company &quot; System @-@ Bau &quot; , &quot; presented publicly on Monday on Monday in the Municipal Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council for the first time . &quot;
originally this point was up to the non @-@ public part of the agenda .
&quot; under the pressure of the critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends passed from the System @-@ Bau @-@ Management in the offensive : &quot; we still don &apos;t have a response to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ours now .
the project has been around ten to twelve million euros and has been discussed in discussion for months .
&quot; fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners , who were arriving at the meeting , saw the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this becomes a giant cl@@ ot@@ z that overlooks all the other gi@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; moreover , he feared like several other proj@@ ec@@ ti@@ cians that the traffic would greatly increase by the intended size of the facility : &quot; as there are no bus inv@@ itations to be so that &quot; &quot; said Martin Schulz &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly on the good a hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , is however still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; first of all , we must have a coher@@ ent concept , &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was even lacking , the development plans were even more variable . &quot;

Google launches a double @-@ double campaign to earn 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling donation campaign , which aims to bring about 11 million $ for humanitarian organizations involving the thousands of refugees who rus@@ hed to the European Nations since they escape from war torn and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach to the announcement of donations on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey includes many dark rail and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and anxiety , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrants crisis grew in Europe , many people like my family are looking desper@@ ately to help . &quot;
&quot; donations are given to four charitable organisations that provide assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million des@@ ks / or low on 11 million $ .

coverage of Y@@ as@@ me@@ en Ab@@ ut@@ al@@ eb ; edited by Christian Pl@@ um@@ b
for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics it can be useful loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for a new study at least five years .
it &apos;s still too early to tell whether easily overweight people will live with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those that do not receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial review of the new study in J@@ ama . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take food .
&quot; over the years obesity have proven to be efficient in treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies were carried out in humans , the disease @-@ obes@@ e with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is regarded as normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that anyone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered as obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
the researchers used the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected since 2007 in a study and compare two kinds of obesity and stomach re@@ pro@@ vision@@ ing - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight .
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this operation , decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; however , the BM@@ I stayed with those who did not receive non @-@ surgical treatment treatments approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; amongst those who undergo a surgical procedure , solve at 36 % of the diabetes disease totally and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes is only dissolved in one percent and in part in only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were carried out in controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also denoun@@ ced the patient blood level of hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar @-@ values in the course of time . &quot;
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent rather write the researchers .
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c decreased by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - as reflected in the improved Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not decrease the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also yiel@@ ded average results with the two kinds of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , the b@@ ypass surgery achieved in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and h@@ ns more than a complete overcoming of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study reveals no survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are references from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was subjected to obes@@ e people who subjected to an obesity operation , which was about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in the surgery patients , Black@@ stone , it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I under 35 which are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without an increased risk of death or a kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors ought to start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we are waiting too long until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated this genetic changes that have identified their body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is more noticeable in fiction : a young woman , to school hours un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets after years the flock of her youth again , and this one loves himself in her . &quot;
&quot; so also in the recently published novel &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond love story , the novel may be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because it plays in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main occupational writer was raised in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and is pleased that she could place her home town a literary monument .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot take up all refugees , the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders called on to end the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of the permanent refugee crisis in his speech at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech at the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford .
he requested that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be posed against the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of the Western European countries was indeed admir@@ able during the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts engaged in coping with the crisis , he stressed that there is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long @-@ term solutions like a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the September 11th terrorist attack and turned out that the violent response of the US attracted a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I met my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I said to him , the way to solving this problem lies in non @-@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put violence and that has brought forth un@@ expected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer by children in the past 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison check@@ centers in the United States report on nearly 400 % discount in the number of children under 12 years , which swal@@ low any alcoholic dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants such as Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenue of manual infectious agents in children under 12 years , the po@@ ison Games report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more frequently to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children can inten@@ tionally drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or cause a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap adventure .
adolescents have alleged to have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mouth water to obtain a tougher beverage .
younger children can be instruc@@ ted by attractive scents of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child doesn &apos;t think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are che@@ ated .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange trees , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants include somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially in infants can already make a few sp@@ las@@ ers for alcohol poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alco@@ ve , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , the medical director of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , named station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not let p@@ luck whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and when children come from it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , which had recently taken four sp@@ lash of abu@@ zer to straw@@ berry fra@@ grant from the school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; their blood concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is lawful on an adult by law , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a not@@ ary doctor , who treated them in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah was pos@@ ing her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency .
doctors practi@@ sed them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit the head the ju@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; that was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; told Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ d &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alco@@ hol@@ ism there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with death cases .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario women died after the dro@@ pping of hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ cl@@ ad ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employee of health authorities suggest that the product meth@@ anol contained a deadly solution , rather eth@@ yl@@ al@@ alcohol , which has been referred to as an active substance . &quot;
&quot; in January she planned three students of the fourth grade in the State New York , their &quot; &quot; mo@@ ose &quot; &quot; teacher , using anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; he announces a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ ams them from their space .
&quot; the police regarded the failed plan as &quot; &quot; lawyers &quot; &quot; and dis@@ mis@@ ed measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

&quot; a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove on the cross @-@ span@@ gled in the direction of the industrial area , and it too late was that at the roundabout two preceding cars had stopped . &quot;
in a row he p@@ inn@@ ed with his truck in the rear of an audi@@ tor and ho@@ we@@ ther this vehicle at a preceding Ford Fi@@ esta .
&quot; in cases of dis@@ cas@@ ing vehicles , Sach@@ damages from about 10 000 Euro was dealt with by the police . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think that players look forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football Match : de Bo@@ er
&quot; former ranking of the Netherlands , and former national player of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that the Dutch football fans must have interest in Celtic , since there is no title rival@@ ry with the ranking . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland you show no highlights of the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the ranking is not there .
people here talk not just about the return of authority .
you speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and this is what they are interested in .
&quot; there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I &apos;m going to turn around things like Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic needs to fight , but the Norwegian Chef s@@ wor@@ or to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which are now standing right at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had already bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel this exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need the support of Celtic because that makes the players better .
to come together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cautious in January @-@ transfers

the ex @-@ Chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window .
players who come in summer will have those pre @-@ season time to integrate themselves what you have seen with our own group in this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding un@@ necessary players to what you really need .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged as it is going to rise in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without labour for the UK as a whole rose up to 1.9 million in the same period . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was over that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent as eviden@@ ced by the figures for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) .
&quot; in the meantime , employment was in Scotland at 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.7 percent over the quarter of the quarter - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented the recent figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it &apos;s almost exactly a year that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labor market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why should I become a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later today , except with a late legal intervention , I will watch how a man is put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator @-@ gallery in the chamber of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , if Richard Glos@@ sip gets controlled by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the United States , and since more applicants are available as places , there is a seem@@ less lottery instead of deciding who is chosen . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media courts from 12 to five .
who will be chosen will observe it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
&quot; besides Richard glos@@ si@@ ps I &apos;m going to sit in a few hours , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with teleph@@ ones and a two and a half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison agencies say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen , in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving me on Twitter to post@@ p@@ one my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , as he wants and you will get access . &quot;
I am able to relate to her .
&quot; she adm@@ its that she &quot; it could have done better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard D@@ sip had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he didn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he will , that an international re@@ porter is present to write there . &quot;
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that public relations will help the movement against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the event , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts which I have made . &quot;
I will not want to go here again .
I can not say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sip is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary of the act .
but I believe that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a fat@@ ality .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and I will see him from that perspective .
I can not claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters for which you can contact them .
&quot; what you get from me is what it means , a man to see an unnecessary death . &quot;

Peter Moo@@ dy understands that ste@@ wards tried to pick him up and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy &apos;s claimed that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria are trying to install a sp@@ y in his ne@@ cks in the past year and finally threatened the race .
&quot; he pointed to the ste@@ wards and the integrity of Racing Victoria and claimed that they held a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai , because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , he always tried to do that which is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it comes to the positive Kob@@ alt @-@ T@@ up@@ den test with Li@@ dar@@ i , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had held itself 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ations , and did not want it to see it as too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating long before , but sometimes you are so frustrated that everything comes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it is widespread .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with it what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well tonight .
&quot; I would like to walk about the main about , and I want my people think I try my best to try . &quot;
&quot; when they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I have to consider what I do with my license .
&quot; before had Moo@@ dy had held the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , so that the integrity of integrity had tried to withdraw his co@@ w@@ d . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian atten@@ dant sitting in a room with a man - I will call him if I was asked - and offered him a job in my stables to provide information about what I do inside my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they clearly believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to believe me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today . &quot;
should I think that it is personally ?
did the R@@ V@@ L behave ? and maybe people are responsible for them outside of the trainers what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps the people are out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they must take my license and violate me , and I have no doubt that what I say to think she is now thinking about it . &quot;
&quot; now I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the frustration levels of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt investigation in Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching led to he said that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known for his preparation of the un@@ failed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , was &quot; ridiculous &quot; , &quot; after a pack of mud or sound was applied to the horse deb@@ ated , which was opposed to the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is opposed to the rules of racing .
&quot; it has to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ ed mud on the leg .
it could have been this evening .
it could have been the whole day as it was so .
but it also did so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month Dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here it is too far gone , &quot; &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver @-@ cur@@ sed were arrested
in the weekend the police took a man after a clash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent rider in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was supplied with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with heavy injury after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley .
&quot; the police said , the driver continued to stop without stopping , in order to help the injured driver . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia presented the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to provide for driver and sub@@ ordinate assistance and also be charged for other traffic .

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy goes back against ri@@ vals for alleg@@ ations to ring
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has called a critique of the Tac@@ tics of his Player as &quot; Agenda &quot; set &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the arbit@@ ers have allowed &quot; Ring@@ fight &quot; with his team during the high Storm winner in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett did not make a funny remark to the Storm team , after his team called the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game an &quot; &quot; example &quot; &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland was not &quot; too good &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , the t@@ ack@@ i defended his crew and said that they are focused on the tac@@ kles only on their &quot; contact . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , he added that the criticism of two leading trainers on his team agree with confidence , as it was compl@@ ain@@ ful that they were worried about the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it always emerges - I did not hear that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring and talking about when she beaten us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ y@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that in the whole year we have not changed anything from our defensive system or techniques , but over the past six weeks we have provided our contact with tac@@ kles at a real focus , and this has provided us with the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to losing , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s really strange how this is emerging again and again at this time of year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; is attacked and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett was winning St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; &quot; te@@ dious &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he was compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; he said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critic@@ ised as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said that he will take care of a sli@@ ce about it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the ball game , which you want to play if you have this kind of players . &quot;
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants that everybody playing his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I have strengthened our trust because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about us to play against us . &quot;
&quot; six weeks ago , they probably did not think of us when it was about the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm had achieved a higher result than the game bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bron@@ cos has probably been a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are there breaks and no points are some cl@@ amping ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; when they mention , it means that we will arrive at it in a phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend as they have won the right to either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begins next morning .
ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 $ deposit for drug abuse
&quot; a man who could possibly be a life @-@ long penalty threatened because of his experiment , into the possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine that were scr@@ apped by Queensland , was released against a b@@ ail of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Bundes@@ poli@@ cem@@ ei 100 kg of the drug was found on the yacht Sol@@ ay , who arrived from South America through Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and recorded in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed whenever he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina during the morning and later in Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially viable punishment for trying to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; judge on the Supreme Court , Peter stro@@ agan , was worried about the escape of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
in the case of the law he was the police on his position .
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the ei@@ ghty declarations of these two people , it is clear that the circulation of $ 200,000 Dollar was a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge f@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from being , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against security , under the conditions that he res@@ ign his Australian and his Ser@@ b pass , surrendered on the police daily and stops at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used telephone of girls to enti@@ ce ped@@ ophi@@ le for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of an 11 year old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the girl of the girl as this slept , log into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through she found the confusing messages and alar@@ ming immediately her mother .
&quot; the police g@@ rie@@ ve themselves and saw the five pictures , analyzed then computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web @-@ research , &quot; the terms used for searching for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g said then , for the officers that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le on the net , &quot; and he said , &quot; a poli@@ cem@@ an to scar@@ ed them . &quot;
&quot; the Ombud@@ sper@@ son E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court &quot; , &quot; he said it would be a addiction to intimi@@ date people . &quot;
&quot; he gave to that the seeking on the computer were performed by him , however , it was done because he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to scar@@ f ped@@ ophi@@ lia . &quot;
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked to send more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head , if he drank , and said he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; &quot; as the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was on tre@@ mb@@ ling and crying . &quot;
she then saw the in@@ decent pictures on the phone and made the accused with them .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said , that the accused did use computer and Play@@ station to speak with girls who saw a lot of younger than he . &quot;

Schle@@ user differ from small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are picked up at the Franco @-@ Austrian border check @-@ up .

the mass makes it &apos; s : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is especially important to record the compact car in the company which is currently well sold . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in demand : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new appro@@ vals was falling under this segment in August alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected on the IA@@ A ( public stage 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , there are many new compact models that come from all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars . &quot;
one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra hat@@ chery in autumn .
&quot; the A@@ stra model is an extremely important model , &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so the volume model was also well sold , the new A@@ stra model should also not become much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel starts a step below the largest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs € 16 9@@ 90 .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 HP , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol @-@ cylin@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; unlike most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , Opel A@@ stra is initially only as fifth . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the wagon , which will also be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be driving up next to the A@@ stra at the IA@@ A ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e in the race .
at the fair is the Mé@@ gan@@ e only as a fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporting GT version .
&quot; at trade he comes in the beginning of next year , then also as a wagon . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance intends to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti is adapting to its curved lines completely into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 PS .
&quot; on offer , however , is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 HP . &quot;
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ em in which in Frankfurt its world premiere .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter aquarium and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is to produce : 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ em in Europe is scheduled for spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact model DS 4 , which is to be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
outside the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front section : here the he@@ ater grill has re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology .
&quot; in the interior space , the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by touch screen and is used for the first time Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; on the IA@@ A , the IA@@ A was added in the compact class , a number of super@@ visor and new variants such as the consolidated Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an explosion @-@ prisoner of the pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary pen@@ it@@ enti@@ er , who was staying for months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; due to the violation of their human dignity , in@@ mates are fundamentally eligible for financial compensation if they are accommodated in small cells . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this decision has made the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday . &quot;
those affected can even hope for money if only a few days were imprisoned in narrow spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was an explosion of in@@ mate with its Constitutional Court in Karlsruhe , Germany . it was lod@@ ged in a single cell hall from June to November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meters . the toilet was not completely separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now at the open and moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his inauguration on account of the un@@ worthy detention conditions against the Land of Berlin .
&quot; however , the Constitutional arbit@@ ers raised the judgment of the chamber of Berlin and transferred it back to the renewed examination . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s man hurt .
chamber court now decides about the amount of compensation .
&quot; even if for legal reasons from the questionable time period only a few days port days were significantly reduced to compensation , whether there was a compensation , it meant . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to fear . &quot;
the chamber is now to clarify the amount of artic@@ ulation .
the Constitutional arbit@@ ers have often been reinforced in the past the rights of prisoners of prisoners .
&quot; thus , it did not matter in April a prisoner of in@@ dem@@ nity , because he was incar@@ cer@@ ated naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; man &apos;s un@@ worthy is according to a decision of 2011 , according to the multi@@ ples of one cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; moreover , moreover , on Wednesday also the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ mate , in a parallel incident in November 2009 had an un@@ decent accommodation . &quot;
&quot; the then se@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff has been placed twice a day between 15 and 21 hours a day , in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin prisons were also due to lack of lack of personnel in the headlines . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore again shut again 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rise , even to blows , it should have already been tense because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information of the judiciary , 21 places in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of offspring of young people , 19 should drop off in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seekers are coming to Germany after forecasts of the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs this year , according to the statement by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated with the unusual challenge posed : &quot; I will say again and again : we can do it and we create it .
what appears in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; it is used for different forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of ministries ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments annually - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all in affordable le@@ aps : each year , 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing falls out of the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments there will also be refugees . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , federal ministries in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) will therefore double its funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would need to arise every year , and the federal government should have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; agreed , scientists and federal ministries agreed that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; the estimates by the institute for labour market and occupational research is to be assumed that in the long term , 55 percent of the refugee population in Germany can be equivalent . &quot;
&quot; however , in Germany , the refugees in Germany would not be asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , Project man@@ ag@@ ger for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is crucial if they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for appreci@@ ating in the reception company , but also for the esteem of the influ@@ x of migrants , &quot; said mig@@ u@@ rolog@@ ist Diet@@ rich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ aci@@ hardt , it has given a political turn : from working ban for refugees to recognize jobs . &quot;
&quot; while it used to be an employment ban for asylum seekers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , just as the resi@@ dency , the asylum seekers at a residence . &quot;
&quot; in the society itself - also because of the lack of skilled labour , it has mostly taken the view that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a great hur@@ dle for access to the labour market are a lack of English .
&quot; until now , there is still no broad range of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs most often conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore based on th@@ co @-@ hardt the royal way to work integration .
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only few mal@@ igned parents give their children to the kit@@ as , estimated to ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the pro@@ ver@@ root parents , it is only once important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ ali@@ enable , spokes@@ person for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family , however , to convince the advantages of the K@@ ita , distri@@ butes the administrative list in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators get strongly rise by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase training capacities - e.g. by having more specialist schools . &quot;
in the countries students are prepared without German knowledge of welcome classes for teaching .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also of teachers , who only have a qualification in English as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate St@@ amps of the Berlin School management . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that some 20 percent of the total population in Germany wish to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land asylum seekers or Ged@@ es@@ ake the study - the only exception to so far was Berlin , In@@ sen@@ ator Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up its attitude . &quot;
studies of study could be facilitated by access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a length of residence or d@@ unge@@ on do not receive services according to the asylum @-@ performance Act , if they start a study . &quot;
&quot; they normally receive no BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they fall under the circle of the bel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees needed to have spent four years in Germany in order to be eligible for BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1st January 2016 onwards , this ten@@ ure shor@@ tens up to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but the financing of finance must also be closed , demand Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will in future play a more important role , because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually overcome the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state @-@ Ch@@ urches @-@ Law to form a new state @-@ of @-@ religions . &quot;
&quot; important also was the establishment of an Islamic welfare association , who takes care of the new arrivals . &quot;
the rights also belong to the rights .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam need to be clear and ready to work with the state in many fields and need to engage in certain areas of control . &quot;
this includes the willingness to act against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maced@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday the concern , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany too . &quot;
&quot; who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany , &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will continue to be a topic of the whole society in the future .
&quot; in this way , the majority society must change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
&quot; Germany has - as a result of European decisions , since a scarce decade of anti @-@ discrimination legislation and a general equ@@ alization law . &quot;
&quot; however , it learned very slowly , as the NS@@ U faction demonstrates , in the police and authorities to systematically ignore the racial element . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organizations and stakeholders cannot demand for long @-@ term international agreements , such as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist Convention on Germany , must be a reality in the coming years and should take advantage of their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; generally speaking , Germany has been able to medi@@ cally support the so @-@ anticipated refugees , says doctor @-@ president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; what concerns Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create the one , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , this would need extra money to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery , all arrivals must be handed over to the registration of health . &quot;
yiel@@ ded services could later be re@@ funded to the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly questionable , so many people face exposure to the restricted level of performance that will see asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are focusing on creating the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; already until now , the Berlin healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has been proven to be more worried about its diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , even in medical offices would have to be accepted interpre@@ ting interpre@@ ting costs . &quot;
but it would have helped many refugees with more general medical challenges in the emergency .
and with another diagnostic glance .
&quot; under the refugee quot@@ as , there are clearly more fear@@ ful disabilities , and in the youth there is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment . &quot;
&quot; with the partial other disease images , German doctors have been coming from their training but think Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so hard to recognize , &quot; and as regards the anno@@ y@@ ance , whether the refugees may be even reli@@ eving in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians had a sophisticated education system , some of them are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , they would have to disc@@ ard their qualification and take again ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees trying to die in Germany is psych@@ ologically ill following the estimates of a post @-@ infection treatment regim@@ en ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most are suffering from a post@@ injury disorder or depression .
&quot; most vulnerable , Refu@@ ge@@ e , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by TU München shows that every five Syrian refugee refugee has been traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is suffering due to a post@@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ compul@@ sive disorder , suffers from among others at the so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with respiratory disorders , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart@@ beat and death . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping and concentrations , strong str@@ ung and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chron@@ ically , be an early treatment necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically sick refugees receive a psych@@ otherap@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill @-@ seekers can provide an application for psych@@ otherapy , however the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the com@@ com@@ s , cases of Sax@@ on or doctors , who are not trained for psych@@ ic conditions , decide whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites for dreams
with the new performance &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the goal is to pull every age group in the spell of fascinating lam@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst load into the ring on the brick , was@@ en to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ ck@@ hr@@ er and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this slogan is the current man@@ ring staged .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the family . &quot;
the gift to am@@ a@@ ze the family is in the blood .
&quot; it is important for us to take away the people from their time to day and take them to a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 year @-@ old junior men . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ ground cocktail with world @-@ city flair , &quot; thus says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometers long tour can now experience this flair .
the program of the cir@@ cus is convinced of talented artists from around the world .
&quot; excellent at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v clo@@ wn Family attracts the audience with wit and charm in their spell . &quot;
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies it wants to take the Cub@@ an duo .
ease and mot@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
their hum@@ orous art on the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s her@@ zen in the storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger@@ tips and joint @-@ iness . &quot;
balanced with the bike on a sphere .
for He Yuan no problem .
slim people are fascinated and scar@@ ed at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of rob@@ atics like little others and fascinated by their flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
abnorm@@ alities in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often subject to various animal protection organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks also in its position : &quot; &quot; it is not good for our animals , it is not good either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every string unit .
&quot; the four @-@ legged arti@@ sts , as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel like it does not want to go into the arena too .
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals care .
&quot; especially on her z@@ eb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived together eight years in a c@@ ages and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
the z@@ eb@@ roid is not yet ready for the arena but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst .
so for each visitor something is likely to be part of this .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; &quot; whether five or 1 200 viewers , we always give our best and are happy with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst loads from 17 to 20 September daily at 17 : 00 and 20 o &apos;clock .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the Tiersch@@ au form is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Sim@@ ba@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , dropped down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the fall quickly spread across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition that they had received anonymous wron@@ g@@ ations and had warned them to accompany the address of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ase .
&quot; last month , they had res@@ igned and interrupted by him during his speech to the State of the State in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent n@@ ese said that seven Op@@ positions politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones which they warned against earlier Mr. Mu@@ gabe .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he said journalists to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; she warns the MP &apos;s Members that the immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave the parliament , its parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
leader said that the Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i party was &quot; concerned about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30.000 jobs in restructuring and savings efforts at the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will later share in two listed companies this year , and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
the anticipated job breakdown leads to a load of over $ 2.7 billion from the fourth quarter . said HP in an explanation .
&quot; this restructuring programme will allow a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , which is to lead the unity after the separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is less and more focused than it is HP today , and we have a wide and abundant portfolio of stores that supports companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than € 50 billion annual revenue of revenue and is being concentrated on delivering integrated technology solutions to companies , such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company created in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , in order to manufacture electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring to cope with the return of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ manufacturer , and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the newest in this area that is based on the belief that closely focused companies perform better performance . &quot;
FC Her@@ arsen@@ al captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates in front of the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the finishing Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; turn towards Wil@@ sh@@ ere , that it is only September and that its rehabilitation is according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England and given its participation in the next summer an European Championship is certainly uncertain .
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le , and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury would not threaten the career , &quot; said L@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not good . &quot;
it is not a major concern .
this was only an accident .
&quot; it was not in connection with his ank@@ le , or with the wounds that he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger &apos;s recognized , there is the associated risk of other injuries , always when a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd had 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ e als 157 Lig@@ ator , in the last five seasons . &quot;
&quot; the wider picture for arsen@@ al is that in six of eight playing times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League Clubs , who have recorded the most vulner@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the injury rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you come back from an injury , you have an accidental frame , a time in which you will have to strengthen your body and gain combat force , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope to stabili@@ ze his body , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al begins his Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb before the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ track on the next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger will exhibit a rotation within the team .
&quot; Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ on Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Re@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and to the players who need it to give a little break , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al are clear favor@@ ites , through Group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the play fields with the largest intimi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 Games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , where the Richter scale were 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was the 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that Arsenal has attracted the doctrine from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven by far @-@ away hope , with his management the association will lead to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to keep realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the com@@ edy show that gave us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up now , now more dist@@ res@@ sed than ever before , as self @-@ murder in young men at a 15 @-@ year high @-@ edge . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 it was the most important death toll in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it is more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ u@@ ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched existence ) 2015 is regarded as the year of the man , with the goal to ask the culture to ask the men to seek help when they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the battle to master this challenge .
&quot; a current study of over 2,000 high school students with de@@ pressed symptoms established that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery was double . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course we have to have friends so that a friendship may work .
&quot; in the age of social media guided , with their focus upon style of substance , in@@ medi@@ ability of the response is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lifestyles have doubled the need to appear highly , li@@ felong and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists are ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire , recently declared , money can really not buy . &quot;
the Beautiful at Friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was put .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but defined by its personality , shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when drums in cozy pub and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all that came out of the knowledge that men can take care of it , even if they often with@@ hold themselves , fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; like an employee of the telephone mental mind told me : ... &quot; &quot; my urge role for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , has really shown me how the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often do not feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase , &quot; &quot; Come and cope , &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that occurred to me , if I try to offer long @-@ term Be@@ ating Mechan@@ isms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; in this way , my object @-@ oriented out@@ sider status about the telephone will also help people in eye @-@ looking desper@@ ation to help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest when you can visit the celebration of the day completely new stre@@ amed background , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , when you see somebody alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say you hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could do .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
&quot; Maria Maria goes to help PS@@ G , Malmö . &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates by Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ar@@ son Cav@@ ani after his arrival on Malmö .
&quot; di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Greg@@ son Cav@@ ani held course as Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ on Tuesday launched .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League Deb@@ ian as PS@@ G @-@ player who brought the French master on his way , but afterwards she adapted quite a number of occasions before she finally scored a head earlier than Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Chess t@@ j@@ or Donetsk in the group A needs Paris a strong start against the Swedish masters , as it is not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ ling laps , but an improvement on the road to the quarters of final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , there was no club meeting of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an G@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s adjusted chances in front of the gate . he was later in play against his hometown team and against the club , with whom he started his illustr@@ ative career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to gain at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win , our opponents have problems and look relaxed , even if there are certain things that we need in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , he returned a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on his own place against Bordeaux in the first League , but he was caught by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian session was designated as the man who can take the PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he went to Manchester United in the last month , and he pointed out why he finished in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense in the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö found the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to reach this level , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was str@@ anded with a five @-@ man defence and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but out of the shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ isp@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G was sometimes faced with some mis@@ ses and bad degrees , not least for S@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was not less than five attempts at the first half of them and then left after the Cav@@ ani took him in the restart . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed much more skill if he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a passport of S@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , turned to Di Maria into a bo@@ gie which was guided by Wil@@ de in the 5@@ 2nd minute on the pole . &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell shortly after the hour of Cav@@ ani , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ er now scored his sixth season , after it had folded a lef@@ tist side of Max@@ well &apos;s Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; this ended all the thought that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of sav@@ or from no distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi was detected at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer of Malmö , age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class about his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league who did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not sufficient . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Glen@@ core collects 2.5 billion $ by share purchases

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 Transfer to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi run by X@@ avi since summer 2015 for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar
&quot; FC Bayern was obviously a few years ago just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , which was then played back to FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger , four times champion of champion , two times club champion , two times European champion , one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is stunning . &quot;
in summer the now 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar .
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca ver@@ ted X@@ avi , now that he was already standing before the Euro 2008 prior to the departure from Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; they said to me , that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me . &quot;
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we say nothing . &quot;
and the registered also of FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ avi : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ i wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; to remember : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ ef@@ oot became the FC Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not variable
but the change did not come about .
and the differenti@@ ating man for this is now working for the German record : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ avi explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Gu@@ ardi@@ ola to contract and I played a great night . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he could not imagine the crew without me .
&quot; thus , he has master@@ ed me . &quot;
who knows how the Bav@@ arian season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ avi .
&quot; X@@ avi stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League against the whole distance on the lawn , folded the Red from ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s supreme triumph . &quot;
Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in the film
Matt Dam@@ on made the Afgh@@ an American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on diversity and said that I will not require behind the scenes .
&quot; during a Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light under@@ scored that experienced actors Brown , when they stressed the need for alternative sp@@ ectives , with regards to a black protagonist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , do it in the cast of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; &quot; insured Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted shocked when offen@@ ded un@@ belief and called &quot; wa@@ hoo ! wow . okay . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian was gaining .
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer @-@ flat Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - how to treat the figure of harmony , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nut@@ shell , which is struck by her white turn . &quot;

&apos;@@ American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos;s first champion
&quot; professional sports , clim@@ bers and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athle@@ te , who won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took the Grand Prix at $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which just ended its 7th season , has never experienced a competition participant , who finished all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to the Fin@@ als . &quot;
the last task was to rock climbing around 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the time , with what he was the first athle@@ te , who finished the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended this challenge for full three seconds quicker , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought win , still under the shock on winning the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or have life &quot; , &quot; said Isaac E ! over his pile of money . &quot;
as suddenly as I can &apos;t even imagine how it is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood porters in order to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , you get the one with the fastest time , &quot; said we@@ ed . &quot;
how much the money is a wonderful price and life changed ; it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he had a gro@@ ll in doing that .
he is just so happy to have done what he did .
to the crowds of awards he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that it Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac had just as felt when they had exchanged the roles .
America Ninja Warri@@ or has been extended to an atri@@ cal season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers cre@@ eping on Minnesota T@@ wins past
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not fun for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; previously , they were once one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler but played this part in the Tuesday against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the target Field .
&quot; twins slo@@ wed a chance for Ascension within a half of Houston , Ast@@ ros for the second American League game . &quot;
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return of the three letter F word which was so difficult to grasp more about a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes &quot; , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad E@@ m . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inner ings then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and made three bars .
it was only his third successful start into his last nine games .
&quot; I want to finish this year strong , &quot; says Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to throw every game in the bull@@ pen each game , and I want to concentrate fully into the game . &quot;
&quot; the design@@ ate Tiger @-@ Hitler &apos;s by Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three results and was in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since the middle of August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit game in Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits on July 6th .
&quot; he has shocked the dr@@ y@@ wood , &quot; said Ms . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( p@@ umping training ) , looked much better off in Bull@@ pen , and he pushed it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three of us at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had her best chance to get back to the game . &quot;
centre Fiel@@ d@@ in the B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Field of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached an enclosed , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cker to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran Wall , the only man who was confronted with which he was facing , in front of the nom@@ inee ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ head@@ mann Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ en@@ ched a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and the finish run on the 2nd pushed Ver@@ ges to the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double Play .
it was the major league of the last 27 times in this season that Pl@@ ou@@ les proposed a double Play
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth place , the Wall managed an R@@ bi @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed sla@@ p S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save . &quot;
Detroit prof@@ ited to the start of the game from a still non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two in@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been painted prior to the play of the vulner@@ ability list , after having been missing for more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I have wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt at ease when I had left and felt that I would put some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ ky gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z produced Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z and played a single &quot; up the abs@@ middle with the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed to run his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ ners in the scoring position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos was followed with a single on the right , managed to run a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third , who ended the threat . &quot;
the tigers were on the second one achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and one Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not been particularly well beaten , but he caught the correct spot . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , achieved no points in the third inning , before being replaced with A@@ J.@@ A@@ ser by the rel@@ ie@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three of us at six hits and a walk of four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Anim@@ ations San@@ chez from falling outside because of a violation of the throw @-@ school .

&quot; the head of the Mün@@ chner Security conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ l , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think the resol@@ ute thinking about military action options should not be held without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he cast away the European states &quot; collective . &quot;
four years ago one was reli@@ eved to have passed the Kel@@ ch of a military involvement in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends at our front door , &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;

Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary also no one going back . &quot;
also Germany did not send any refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is as agreed , &quot; &quot; explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement , after which Germany could record a specific number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already been in this case between the Director General for Public Security and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees were over the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria . &quot;
your goal is mostly Germany .
chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on common action in the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting on binding distribution of further 120 000 refugees .
&quot; in view of the strong refugee industry in Germany , the federal government wants to support the federal government and the distribution of people more strongly . &quot;
&quot; the covenant will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after an almost four @-@ hour consultation with the Prime Minister in the law office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel stressed , those people who need protection , pray this too . &quot;
but whoever does not have a lead perspective cannot remain in Germany too .
this view was quite impressive in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or emphas@@ ised that the state as a whole now must tackle a &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands killed thousands of refugees meanwhile are stuck on the road route .
Hungary had closed his 175 kilometres long border with Serbia on the night .

Rome has now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz
nearly 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin Lu@@ ther Square .
&quot; in the presence of city President Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday there was a still nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German The@@ ologist of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome just next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was filed by the working community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the town of the Pop@@ es could live only centuries only in secret society . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic manner , it becomes visible that its tradition of the Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) was held as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn@@ around 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city at that time as conf@@ essed sinners .
his negative impressions o@@ sten@@ si@@ fy him according to historians in his later battle against Rome .

hammer grant artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
&quot; Jesus having the ( gold @-@ pl@@ ated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main pieces , which is painted in Ot@@ mar Alt for his bi@@ ble . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and revised Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which is now published with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning the picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt , who has formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means identical with &quot; funny &quot; images .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years , Ot@@ mar Alt is working on his Bible project , for which he made a subjective @-@ artistic selection of the many topics of &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; arising are cycles , which devote themselves to themes such as Chap@@ els , pl@@ agues , commandments or father@@ land . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he was un@@ fascinated by several partners : this is true for the Lu@@ ther publishing house with its the@@ ological outlook as well as for the Kettler @-@ publisher with its focus on art books . &quot;
and it is mainly the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post which had grap@@ pled on the basis of painting with the respective Bible study .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible selected by Ot@@ mar , and thus translated into current relationships . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirror of al@@ ts painting .
&quot; we are nestled between the original Bible College of Martin Lu@@ ther , each one set of the artist , who here formulated his very personal thoughts about the situation . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows double a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
it is a high degree of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode born and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant rulers of the Order . &quot;
&quot; that the education already happened again with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to do that , maybe to get myself with the Lord Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to re@@ plen@@ ish art in quick@@ ening time again : &quot; the perception of ima@@ gery is now shaped by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is in@@ as@@ ur@@ ised .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt &apos;d want the viewer to get involved in the pictures , &quot; &quot; get involved , discover , discover and feel the power they have : &quot; the image is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ post commen@@ cement on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung , &quot; had always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like , as he understands with his images . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care to capture the Bible entirely , but the most important topics for him . &quot;
&quot; this was no collaboration on eye @-@ height , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text describes only . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from the Lu@@ ther Verlag , this work is an invitation to spread &quot; his life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love and the responsibility .
a portion of the origin@@ als - and fla@@ x@@ wall @-@ wall pictures - is presented for the first time in an exhibition which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation on November 15 .
construction work for BM@@ X train
&quot; plans taken , place found , companies have been commissioned to model the Earth &apos;s boun@@ cers for a round course : one year later it was almost everything ready - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X train was finally finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration for Ver@@ dr@@ uss , especially among the residents who don &apos;t want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus hills de@@ ported , new place sought - now with formal planning and request for building permit . &quot;
the authorization will go down in October could be the first community of Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the child and youth affairs committee .
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there would then be started without &quot; &quot; further memorial &quot; &quot; with works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees to 2019 , and the German Bundesliga are committed to a clear sign during the weekend . &quot;
&quot; the football response to the emerging situation in Germany , ensuring politics his help in addressing the upcoming problems . &quot;
&quot; I consider this for the biggest challenge of our country since the reunion .
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter to me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; that is how everyone is interested to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B Chef Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
at the Annual Meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively .
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the office office and there the Minister of Foreign Minister , Mrs Ber@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; as the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out must be the policy .
the German Football League has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years .
&quot; about the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Braun Foundation we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the outskirts of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some states are also supporting this program .
on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ ge sets out a clear sign when they will carry on the left Tri@@ kot@@ ar Car@@ mel instead of the usual sponsorship @-@ logos ( Her@@ mes ) to the imprint &quot; We will help - # Cle@@ es@@ welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help , where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ sman Ru@@ di Fi@@ ler the &quot; &quot; picture &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and describes the project as a &quot; natur@@ al@@ ness . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes every one , nobody is allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football officials , no , we have to use our spotlight , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ un@@ hei@@ ms CEO Peter Ret@@ tig speak of a &quot; prominent symbol of the league . &quot;
&quot; at the EM @-@ Quali@@ fication play against Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach held the support of refugees as a large communal power plant in football .
&quot; that all 36 roy@@ alties in their places have started their own projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .

reports : SAP @-@ Calcul@@ ation loses an eye in case of an accident
&quot; the leader of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t has been lost , according to several reports reported by a down@@ fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident at the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he had fallen after midnight on a water@@ glass that he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bloody , was power@@ less , then he went out to@@ wed down the road - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; &quot; Where &quot; &quot; SAP @-@ room@@ mate @-@ founder @-@ founders . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could follow his work .
&quot; early October we meet at the meeting of the Supervisory Board in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; she said . &quot;
the 54 year old manager will be at the meeting and &quot; fully operational . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; on Thursday of Thursday , he will come back to Germany in October and continue to lead to the German software . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full of SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I regularly played in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its Chairman H@@ asso Plat@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually comm@@ uting between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German co @-@ headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen that way . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you like it . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen from the ...

soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ el f@@ eller in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play in Europe League has finally struck . &quot;
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundesliga as well as in the du@@ el with the G@@ FR@@ P Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 19.00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; we cannot rely on him unfortunately , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga , at Le@@ verk@@ usen , he left BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of its pros , Tu@@ ck@@ les will change its head eleven not only on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
therefore Roman turn@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Chief Apostle Roman Kol@@ ki .
&quot; he exercises on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; though past@@ el f@@ eller in the future will be used in all Europe @-@ league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les allowed them to be open . &quot;
&quot; in probability , he will also deny the second game . &quot;
the for@@ ge statement of fellow players re@@ us that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the goal of re@@ trac@@ eable Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; Marco does not lie so wrong .
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Robot@@ er@@ un@@ tos : government wants to lead the pioneering role in Germany
&quot; according to the will of the Federal Government , Germany is expected to be at the forefront of technological change . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt announced on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the Autom@@ echanika IA@@ A of a &quot; new mobile age . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated , net@@ worked driving will increase traffic safety and take care of less con@@ ges@@ tion , &quot; said Do@@ do . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his counterparts from the G@@ 7 States , who also meet with representatives from the industry at the IA@@ A . &quot;
the strategy paper of the Transport Ministry is the importance of mobile broad@@ band building and a br@@ isk sales on digital radio .
testing of new technology is currently undergoing a test line on the 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; in order to allow the driver &quot; no additional liability @-@ risks &quot; , &quot; the Federal Government aims to examine the legal framework , and , where necessary , to adapt to new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus Germany , for example , intend to use an international level that the per@@ missible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicles is raised from 10 to 130 km @-@ kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also wants to work for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only sees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; with automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras , which collect the environment and process data in seconds . &quot;
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving will be technically possible on motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
nevertheless vehicles on public roads were not expected to be expected far after 2020 .
&quot; added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions on site in Germany will appreciate the authors of the study , 20@@ 25 to some EUR 8.@@ 4 billion . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ c@@ ws can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; said the SPD &apos;s public transport system S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in injuries and the safety of the personal data of the driver must be clearly clarified . &quot;
still the Germans self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday at the AA institute on behalf of the For@@ sa Institute in the order of the Test DE@@ K@@ RA is expected to believe that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars occur in the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it , 31 percent do not believe in it . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of the surve@@ yed held in France compared with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ driving vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey conducted by Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to aver@@ t control throughout the ride on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that could result in flowing traffic at least 15 percent , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would not abandon the car to the car under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table @-@ p@@ ong EM .
the Düssel@@ dor@@ fer wants to take place on the title fight from September 25 to October 4 only in single .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys got it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title &quot; , &quot; said Bundes@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this point , B@@ oll was situated at that point on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing date in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected on Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the downside , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; stated Open@@ er @-@ European ister Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ als in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , did not recall the June 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo too was missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; this is what we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; explained the world @-@ wide @-@ fifth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an endor@@ sement
&quot; it is a mixture of very great fashion show , and a qu@@ ail shell : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich . &quot;
&quot; the highlights : window man@@ nequ@@ ins , which thanks to video proj@@ ections app@@ end human . &quot;
&quot; they contribute to the spectacular creations of the French designer , which was made among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion shows - and that he put men in skirts . &quot;
&quot; I can no longer say today that I am the endo@@ cr@@ ant of the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be so easy , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk on the tre@@ ad ) , which will be seen from September 18 at the Kuns@@ thalle at the HY@@ PO Cultural Foundation , it is a luck that the Mo@@ des@@ sm@@ aler has changed his first with@@ stand attitude to a vision on his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , saying , &quot; &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously made train in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it is about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a matter of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits offer a glimpse into that barely even at the man &apos;s work , the fashion history has written without ever having completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograp@@ hed overall art work , for which much expenditure was operated : to fr@@ ise the dolls , for example , was also a sty@@ list . &quot;
14 tonnes of material have spar@@ ed the movers according to information of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
&quot; shortly before the start of the October legend , it was a special treat for a leather out@@ fit with cor@@ set . &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also palate @-@ old t@@ ed@@ dy are visible in the exhibition .
&quot; it stands for the first , z@@ ag@@ om@@ ini@@ ous case @-@ trying of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he was attracted to his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
to play with a d@@ oll &apos;s d@@ oll your parents would not have allowed him to play .
he sent fashion to fashion then .
he served as fashion journals and watched the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier was told in Munich .
but later I bought it naturally .
for his first own fashion show he did not pay for Mod@@ els .
&quot; they got nothing , they were allowed to keep the clothes ... &quot;
jewelry instead of clo@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
formerly it went to the long nit@@ el@@ ers in and around pl@@ aint because of making a few meters .
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and tips were made in large quantities for customers , which they worked for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the alone does not work anymore , says Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the sl@@ oth @-@ store . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , fashion played a bigger role , then was then pushed through the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , which re@@ jects on past styl@@ istic periods , there is a growing race @-@ potential . &quot;
whoever is not served in the textiles industry in Germany is no longer available on the market .
they are already half of all the orders made with us .
Mo@@ zar@@ itze are combined together with nine other companies member of the branch verband Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies .
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of the sales were broken . &quot;
private business stores and also wholesale trade are available almost no longer .
our products reach the customers in this way hardly .
the mass ware may be produced much cheaper in the Asian region and is driven almost exclusively by chains .
&quot; furthermore , the export of exports to Russia and the US . &quot;
enough reasons are for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points with environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer of the nit@@ rogen in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; since this year we have a seal of quality that shows that we are environmentally sound and socially sensible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
diploma Director U@@ te Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Foreign Office of the West@@ Anglo @-@ Sax@@ on University Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and Tips .
&quot; in order to prevent the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is an tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and businesses , which must think mainly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
this is why an existing design often means only slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago animated textile s@@ lab@@ yrinth Kat@@ i Re@@ uter offers the historical snow @-@ top .
&quot; however , the machine l@@ ends in some places small kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ schm@@ ie@@ de@@ tour in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ auss , let themselves be inspired : &quot; previously I could not do anything with traditional pl@@ ers . &quot;
now she uses the snow @-@ top for her jewellery .
in an elaborate technique they shapes the patterns in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject of Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in pl@@ aint and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; in this way , I see my jewelry as a modern ambassador of the pl@@ au@@ ener . &quot;
Disney plans new &apos; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; Film
legends will not stir you but Disney went nonetheless to a new film by his &apos; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &apos; .
&quot; according to &quot; entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a new filter but a kind of continuation , the 20 years after the first film plays with the magical children . &quot;
this concerns the experience of the N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the global economic crisis in England .

XI urge the economy to open wider to the world
&quot; the economy has to open wider to the outside to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group of charged with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; China should work towards ensuring foreign investment and expertise and to improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; &quot; he said in an address at the 16th meeting of the central executive group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; ahead of new start @-@ ups and further reforms will indu@@ ce new impetus and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , &quot; said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the managers have adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list of regulation of market access , relaxation of border control policies , promoting citizens &apos; policies ( SO@@ E ) , to take private capital , and re@@ conditioning of the residents of Mel@@ de@@ system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies identified , which are not questioned for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance , as the market points to the market a greater role in the access of resources , a legally @-@ state business environment and design an open market , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also ease controls on the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how to run their business .
the statement also stated that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and to explore new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; in the context of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened to private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legally interests of foreign finance companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by calibr@@ ating the requirements and the application process . &quot;
the law of lawyers to guarantee their activity and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors was also discussed during a meeting .
&quot; at the meeting also Prime Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important Guide , like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli took part , as reported in a statement published after the meeting was published . &quot;
EU wants to double mer@@ cury value in predat@@ ors
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mer@@ cury in large predat@@ ors and consumers with a significantly higher dose of nervous system .
&quot; consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who presented an appropriate work paper of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side effects fails , &quot; said Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t said the threshold of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , can be raised from one on two milli@@ gram Qu@@ eck@@ ar under the kilograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; big rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are already charged so strongly with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still existing limit values , roughly 50 per cent of the cat@@ ches are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after the dou@@ bling of the threshold values , there would be only 14.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
&quot; in return for this relaxation , the EU wants according to F@@ ood@@ watch the threshold values for other fish of currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram Qu@@ eck@@ ar per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch was regarded as &quot; trick , &quot; because small cem@@ eter@@ ies , such as car@@ p are usually so low exposed , that they already keep the planned maximum value today . &quot;
&quot; the sen@@ ti@@ fication in Kl@@ einf@@ isch was therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant &quot; dis@@ mis@@ sive , &quot; which is alone the economy &quot; , &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is an anti @-@ toxic material which extends over the food chain above all in car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es .
&quot; the Federal Government , therefore , warns that &quot; already low levels can cause particularly in un@@ born impair@@ ments of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the prevailing maximum values , but that a health hazard to the general population does not expect to be expected . &quot;
Mercury is carried out mainly through the coal @-@ combustion into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information by the Federal Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Bundestag Ann@@ alena is more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total population in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanent and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; in March had c@@ eded in March from the paper . &quot;
in the past year Europe @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish have already become the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ System RA@@ S@@ FF .
