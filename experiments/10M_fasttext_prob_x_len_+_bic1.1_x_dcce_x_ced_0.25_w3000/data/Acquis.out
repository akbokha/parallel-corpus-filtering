&quot; a ) To implement effective implementation of the backup measures in accordance with this Convention provides the Community of Organization in accordance with this Convention information on core material , security measures , and on the characteristics of the systems that are required for the implementation of backup measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) The organisation requires only the minimum level of information and data that is compatible with the implementation of their tasks on this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on equipment will be restricted to the minimum level , which is necessary for the use of backup measures in terms of core material that is necessary to secure the backup measures after this Convention . &quot;
&quot; in search of the Community , the organization is ready to evaluate investment data , which respects the community as a particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to over@@ head the organisation , unless they remain accessible to the organization in the premises of the community without further information . &quot;
a ) The organisation accepts the consent of the Community and states to the naming of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) raises the community either against a suggested naming or at any point against a given designation , so proposes the organization of the community and the states one or more alternative scenarios . &quot;
&quot; in due to the repeti@@ tive ref@@ usal of the community , the naming of inspec@@ tors of the organization , the advice is imp@@ aired by the scope of the Organisation - in the following as &quot; the Director @-@ General , &quot; with the aim of meeting suitable measure . &quot;
B ) The Community and the affected countries undertake the necessary steps to make sure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can actually deliver them according to their agreement .
C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are set up so that i ) the possible off@@ ences and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of nuclear activities as low as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other inspec@@ tors of the organization to ensure knowledge and confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each State uses the organization , including its assets , funds and credit , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks of the agreement on the pr@@ ero@@ g@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; securing arrangements after this agreement will end with regard to nuclear material , when the community and the organization determine that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is used for a nuclear activity , which is not usable or practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; the Community refers to the organisation , according to the provision of this convention , the transfer of core material from the states that are subject to the backup measures after this Convention . &quot;
&quot; securing actions after these conventions are termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as envisaged in this Convention for which the responsibility has taken over . &quot;
&quot; the organization guides documents , from which any disclosure and if necessary be the re@@ application of the backup measures on the continued core material . &quot;
&quot; should core material , the backup measures are subject to this Convention , used in non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the backup measures will be termin@@ ated after this agreement with regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the ker@@ material is not used during the duration of the non @-@ application of the backup measures for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants .
&quot; B ) The organisation and the Community meet a regulation that , in this agreement , backup measures will not be applied only as long as the core material used in such activity . &quot;
&quot; in the scheme , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will once again be applied as soon as the nuclear material is again led to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization will be held over the total amount and the composition of this material in the country or the respective countries , and on any distribution of such material from this state or of these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains the consent as quickly as possible ; it extends only to matters such as contemporary and proced@@ ural regulation and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an in@@ sider knowledge of the military activity , nor does it relate to the use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the costs involved in each of them in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; arise from the community , the states or individuals who are subject to their territory , however an extraordinary cost as a result of a special ground@@ ing of the organization , the organization re@@ funded these expenses , provided that they prepared in advance in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sample copies , which are demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states are certain that the liability of liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , can be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions for the purpose of implementing the Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the community or a State against the organization or the organization in relation to the organization or the organization in relation to the association or state of damage - with the exception of damages from a nuclear incident - will be asser@@ ted in accordance with international law in accordance with international law .
&quot; the Council asked for checking the information presented by him from the Director General Director , that the organization has not been able to re@@ tract for nuclear weapons or other nuclear energy bodies , thus he can reimbur@@ se the reports in Article XII ( C ) of the Stat@@ utes and may also take on the other measures provided there . &quot;
&quot; in these steps the Council takes into account in which mass caused by applied backup measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is concerned - any reasonable opportunity to provide the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; in search of the organization , community or State , consultations have held consultations on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;

the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine when implementing the provisions of the part I via backup measures to be defined as required .
&quot; the aim of the backup measures established in this Convention is to timely discovery of nuclear weapons and other nuclear plants for un@@ familiar purposes , as well as de@@ terr@@ ent of such dis@@ junction due to the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; for drawing up the item 28 fixed target it will be used as a backup of fundamental importance , related use of space and observation as an important supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the follow @-@ up by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which for any kind of material zone that is not listed for a specified period of the accuracy of the most accurate material limits for the specified oceans .
&quot; when carrying out their tests , the Organisation for Article 3 does not make full use of the Community &apos;s security system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core material in accordance with this Convention is based on an outline in material areas .
&quot; when applying their backup measures , the community of de methods and measures will make use of the following kinds of use and they , as far as required , see how they are determined and expe@@ dient in supple@@ mental cuts : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the quantities of preserv@@ em , vers@@ ed , lost , lost or in other way from the stock of remote material and the amounts ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement certainty ;
C ) Proc@@ ed@@ ure for identification and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which covers the core material consisted of material materi@@ alisation and the changes of this order , including the one - and outputs of the material zone ; &quot;
G ) precautions that ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures will not extend to material in the mining industry or at the arch@@ ing processing .
&quot; B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ous material that is not yet reached under letter c ) in the States , so shares the organization of organization the quantity and composition of the material , provided that it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material that is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or the processing phase , in which it is produced , or will be introduced to the core material or other , in a later phase of the core burning material in the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The backup measures provided in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under Article 11 conditions , however , the Community is not warran@@ ted , however , that the recovery from core material , the backup measures are not possible or desired , so consult the organisation and the community with each other through the use of appropriate backup measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures provided in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material among the requirements specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the community determine that this core material is practically non @-@ refundable . &quot;
&quot; in search of the Community , the organization releases the following core material from the backup measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ ic@@ able material when it is used in grams or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , in case such nuclear material is retro@@ fitting , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 which is over 80 % .
&quot; in search of the Community the organization releases the organization of nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to security measures , provided by these backup measures , provided the entire , due to this article in the states of liber@@ ated core areas at no time is more than
a ) a total of a kilo@@ gram@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ licity of its weight by filling , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment which is under 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above that of natur@@ ists is calculated by multip@@ licity of its weight with the twenty @-@ five square of en@@ rich@@ ment ;

&quot; the organisation is based on the initial report adopted in Article 62 of the initial report of the entire , the backup measures of this Convention in the States , irrespective of its origin , and results in this inventory due to the subsequent reports and the results of its follow @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , Ireland , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organization ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; at ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ING NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ Ã@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help the UN Conference for International Economic Co @-@ operation , to help the immediate needs of individual countries with low incomes , whose development is disabled by general res@@ sour@@ cent@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States , that the whole of the Member States will be bound to the agreement within six months and as far as possible within two years after the agreement entered into the form of loan , and the organization will do its possible so that this goal is achieved . &quot;
&quot; D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other over the proposed execution and administration of this agreement and the mid@@ bin@@ dings , to ensure broad and balanced geographical distribution within the scope of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC has presented a table which is evident in which way they intended to apply the criteria set in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization manages a special account under the term &quot; &quot; Special Official Account &quot; , &quot; which is conducted by the Member States in accordance with this agreement ; this account is defined by the organization as administrative bank account ( in this property , the organization referred to as &quot; car@@ et@@ ter &quot; ) , and only to the purposes stated in this agreement , and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the client account will be separately and separated from all other accounts and activ@@ ations of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or un@@ pre@@ ten@@ tious guilt of the Member State , which must be paid upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the client &apos;s transaction , and to place the organisation of the organisation in the concerned country . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The payment is made in two forms , namely i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the agreement or to any other between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second amount of the remainder of the contribution to 1 . January 1979 or at a different point , the deadlines set between the EEC and the administr@@ ations , taking into account the deadline required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can provide payments before the above mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedure of the organization , the administr@@ ter takes about dis@@ proportionate pulling on the cash or the school d@@ ots to cover the expenditure for the special transaction and to equi@@ p the client account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the granting of these loans , the administrator can be guided according to the conditions of the EEC on the following factors : &quot;
III ) the scale in which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ;
&quot; VI ) of the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further credit @-@ capacity to Dar@@ leh@@ ens@@ ity , without delay ; and &quot;
VII ) the circum@@ ference in which the problems of the respective countries are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; any special transaction tax serves the financing of a clearly defined and quickly exp@@ ectable development program or precautions ( including a sec@@ toral demonstration ) , which is applicable to the procedures and practices of the organization of financing funds , evaluated , approved and administr@@ ated , whereby the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement shall be considered to be taken into account the aim of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funding from the Special Agency may not be used instead of ord@@ ant funds of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the Bank or organization on the day of the adoption of this agreement by the directors of the Bank or Organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special transaction tax will be subject to the same pay@@ back conditions , which are applicable to the organization granted for the organization , they are refundable at ten free years in each case in 50 years . &quot;
special transaction loans are provided in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to pay this watch are directly related to the organization that maintains it .
&quot; any special transaction tax is determined by a separate Dar@@ fur agreement between the beneficiaries , and the administrator , in which the origin of the means is indicated . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from any special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the recei@@ vers or goods or services manufactured in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization are defined , and which , according to the notification of what the administrator at the time of Dar@@ w@@ ens@@ ation has established , recei@@ vers of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; capital payments from special transaction loans take place on the Special bank account , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state is returned to its receipt as soon as possible by the administrator of the Member State . &quot;
the administrator has taught the EEC until the full award of all special transaction granted the EEC relating to the audit by the directors in preparation and by the directors approved by the directors .
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction , the administrator has taught the EEC quarterly a year on the development of the special transaction and for the previous expenses . &quot;
&quot; the administrator is transferred to the EEC as soon as possible after conclusion of the financial year of the organization , with an opinion on external computers with an opinion on this account . &quot;
&quot; after full withdrawal of the special transaction , the administrator of the EEC is transmitted as soon as possible a detailed account of the project &apos;s special account @-@ funded plans and programmes . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker created and conduc@@ tion suitable records and billing , from which the contributions to the special transaction , derived from the account received and out of the account paid and the withdraw@@ als are visible to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the administr@@ atively to the complete edition of the special ac@@ creditation of time to time an exchange of exchange about the status of the special ac@@ creditation of financing programs or projects and on all other questions that concern the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will be on 31 . December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the Organization may be agreed , not into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the entire capital gains received by the beneficiaries , according to Article II Section 8 of this agreement , the agreement is re@@ paid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the EEC , according to the proced@@ ural provisions of each party . &quot;
the governments of the Member States refer to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of the European Communities with the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
&quot; the Secret@@ ariat leads these noti@@ fications , along with a notification of proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organisation . &quot;
&quot; this agreement will be effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the notification of the aforementioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is derived in two inscri@@ ptions in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , with every word according to the masses . &quot;

in the form of a brie@@ fing between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic via trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ um
&quot; I adore myself to cover the recent negotiations between our delegations during the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community related to the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; in the context of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina following the community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure its appropriate procedures that the actual quantity did not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties of this agreement will consult with each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned calls to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community does not take care of the protective clause , it is obliged to bear for it , that in this agreement the access to Argentina &apos;s accession to the shared market is not touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the penetration of Argentina will exceed the agreed quantities in Argentina , the community reserves the right to exp@@ ire from Argentina to the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
&quot; the community has committed itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on , from this agreement to a twe@@ et of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot;
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the scope of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the reimbur@@ sement for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this context , it is carried out under the number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ation of the added value . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is set under number 2 , with the day of accession of Greece to the Community on 23 000 tons of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
the community opens everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ uni@@ an on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precautions , so that the paragraph of intervention stocks in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of an Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ bs are not under@@ mining . &quot;
&quot; taking account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agree that every actual use of equipment or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will be in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community trading with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are compatible in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular article 10 paragraph 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the design and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina guarantees the compliance with this agreement in particular , in particular that it is issued in the quantities established in the agreement specified in this agreement for number 1 @-@ mentioned products . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to make all necessary arrangements , so that the issu@@ ance of import @-@ licenses for the aforementioned products is made with origin in Argentina from the presentation of an export @-@ license , which was given the relevant position by which of the Argent@@ in@@ ean government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system will be determined that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods can be avoided .
&quot; furthermore , the relevant Argent@@ in@@ ean authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals have been issued in regular intervals to en@@ code the quantities required for the export license ; these details may be determined according to the identification procedure . &quot;
the Committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and will work smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency in the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market in both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions which are of importance to which under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee bears concern that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by this agreement , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out at the collective Tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community . &quot;
the committee discussed all questions involved in implementing this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be un@@ troubled by the rights and commitments of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the amount of the amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 .
&quot; the amount dealt with from the entry into force of this agreement until 1 . January of the following year , the amount will be set in relation to the total annual amount and contributes to the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and according to the compliance of the Treaty on the one hand , and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 . March 1984 ; after this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to announce it in writing by one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be subject to changes from the two parties before 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes , which it will be understandable to be necessary . &quot;

&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and the extermination of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb @-@ meat , according to the world market , has to be assured that the normal sales of new spiritual h@@ amm@@ ers - and lamb @-@ meat on these markets is not affected , I honour the following agreement : &quot;

new Zealand will receive the assurance that the normal paragraph of his H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ uni@@ a is not drawn by the use of the regulation in co @-@ passion@@ ately .
&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement is obliged to ensure New Zealand , by means of appropriate procedures that the actual amount of the amount does not sur@@ pass the fixed amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ standing amounts are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .

&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community will change in consultation with New Zealand , which in clause 2 fixed amounts according to the scope of the New Zealand trade with every new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the reimbur@@ sement for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this , the clause 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ alls of the added value will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is set in clause 2 , with the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 2@@ 45 500 tons of battle @-@ weight . &quot;

&quot; taking account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agree that every actual use of equipment or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will be in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community trading with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities referred to in clause 2 in particular , that there is no export licensing over these amounts . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to make all necessary arrangements , so that the issu@@ ance of import @-@ licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export @-@ licence licence , which is provided by the New Zealand government designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;

&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS that depend on its cultivation the existence and the living standards of millions of families , which in turn depend entirely upon the measures imposed on maintaining and expanding the consumption of olive oil in the producers itself and in the non @-@ producing countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the fact that olive oil and tablets are essential in the areas where the olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the essential characteristic of the olive oil is the in@@ regular expression of the harv@@ ests and the market supply , and that this leads to fluctu@@ ations of production , prices and export resources , as well as very different patho@@ gen ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that this is all particular difficulties caused by the interests of the producers and consumers seriously , and to je@@ op@@ ardi@@ se the general policy of economic growth in countries where the olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
