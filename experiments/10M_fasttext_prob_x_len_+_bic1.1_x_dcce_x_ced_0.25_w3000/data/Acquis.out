in the form of a brie@@ fing between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic via trade with H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ um
&quot; I adore myself to cover the recent negotiations between our delegations during the import of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina into the European Economic Community related to the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat . in the course of these negotiations , the two parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; in the context of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina following the community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure its appropriate procedures that the actual quantity did not exceed the agreed quantity and executed according to the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties of this agreement will consult with each other prior to the introduction of such a change in the number 10 mentioned calls to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community does not take care of the protective clause , it is obliged to bear for it , that in this agreement the access to Argentina &apos;s accession to the shared market is not touched . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the penetration of Argentina will exceed the agreed quantities in Argentina , the community reserves the right to exp@@ ire from Argentina to the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
&quot; the community has committed itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on , from this agreement to a twe@@ et of 10 BC . ad val@@ or@@ em . &quot;
&quot; when entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed amount according to the scope of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the reimbur@@ sement for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this context , it is carried out under the number 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ation of the added value . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is set under number 2 , with the day of accession of Greece to the Community on 23 000 tons of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
the community opens everything to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ uni@@ an on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precautions , so that the paragraph of intervention stocks in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of an Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el - and lam@@ bs are not under@@ mining . &quot;
&quot; taking account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agree that every actual use of equipment or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will be in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community trading with these products . &quot;

the details of the application of this system will be determined that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods can be avoided .
&quot; furthermore , the relevant Argent@@ in@@ ean authority of the competent authority of the community in regular intervals have been issued in regular intervals to en@@ code the quantities required for the export license ; these details may be determined according to the identification procedure . &quot;
the Committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and will work smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency in the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market in both parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including the conditions which are of importance to which under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee bears concern that the proper use of this agreement is not affected by this agreement , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb , and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out at the collective Tari@@ ff numbers according to the Community . &quot;
the committee discussed all questions involved in implementing this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall be un@@ troubled by the rights and commitments of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat &quot;

&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep economy and the extermination of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb @-@ meat , according to the world market , has to be assured that the normal sales of new spiritual h@@ amm@@ ers - and lamb @-@ meat on these markets is not affected , I honour the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02 / 02 A IV ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat , access to the market of the community in the established level will be ensured . &quot;
new Zealand will receive the assurance that the normal paragraph of his H@@ amm@@ el - and L@@ amm@@ uni@@ a is not drawn by the use of the regulation in co @-@ passion@@ ately .
&quot; to ensure a flawless functioning of the agreement is obliged to ensure New Zealand , by means of appropriate procedures that the actual amount of the amount does not sur@@ pass the fixed amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ standing amounts are carried out in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .
&quot; the community assured that New Zealand will not be prevented from doing new technological developments , or to maintain its competitive position on the market of the community . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade be possible , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned , in order to find adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community participates in the protective clause , it is obliged to protect itself from the agreement of New Zealand &apos;s interests . &quot;

&quot; when entering new Member States , the Community will change in consultation with New Zealand , which in clause 2 fixed amounts according to the scope of the New Zealand trade with every new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the reimbur@@ sement for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this , the clause 5 named Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ alls of the added value will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount is set in clause 2 , with the day of the accession of Greece to the community on 2@@ 45 500 tons of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community opens everything to avoid market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ability on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community takes precautions , so that the paragraph of intervention stocks in frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation will not under@@ mines this objective . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contractual parties make everything to promote the consumption of creative in the community with no danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking account of the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agree that every actual use of equipment or other subsidies for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs , as well as to the slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , will be in line with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community trading with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities referred to in clause 2 in particular , that there is no export licensing over these amounts . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to make all necessary arrangements , so that the issu@@ ance of import @-@ licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the presentation of an export @-@ licence licence , which is provided by the New Zealand government designated by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system will be determined that on the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import licence for the goods can be avoided .
&quot; furthermore , the relevant intellectual authority of the competent authority of the competent authorities in regular intervals have been issued in regular intervals to en@@ code the quantities required for the export license ; these details may be determined according to the identification procedure . &quot;
&quot; the Committee is concerned , that the agreement will be properly applied and will work smoothly . &quot;

a concentration of human red blood cells is a unity of human blood that has been removed from the most part of the plasma .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cells components can be present or may be partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentration consists of either the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ an artificial complex solution that was placed after the removal of the plas@@ mas .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells should be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so is the approximate percentage of the y@@ thro@@ cy@@ stic volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) on the label . &quot;
&quot; all procedures required for the production required must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the order must be made under the use of a steri@@ le , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;

&quot; to turn off the damaging effects of bacterial products in plasma , blood don@@ ors , the signs of a bacterial infection can not be used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to dimin@@ ish the danger of transmission of I@@ no@@ kul@@ ation@@ ists , are to be reduced to plastic surgery , which are no more than 12 donations , or other methods to apply these dangers to be comparable in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid amount , from which one went to the production of plasma , corresponding water supply is required ; the substance must be fully resolved within 10 minutes from 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum Plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which is produced the liquid amount , which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
