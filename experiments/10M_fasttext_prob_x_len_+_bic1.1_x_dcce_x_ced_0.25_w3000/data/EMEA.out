&quot; it is available as a 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , than 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg melt ( tablets that dis@@ solve in the mouth ) as a solution to one ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ecting solution ( 7,5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Sho@@ res mind and Spe@@ ech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mis@@ trust and madness ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental disorder , in which patients have regular episodes ( periods abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; bili@@ fy is applied to the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients , which have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is applied to rapid control of gest@@ ed anxiety or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral ing@@ esting of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be used or the melting pot in patients with lo@@ osing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines , which are just as bili@@ fy , the dose should be adapted by A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole mainly affects the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters affects the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in with schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder contributes to norm@@ alize Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and its recur@@ r@@ ence is prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , the recur@@ r@@ ence of symptoms to prevent , has been studied in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar disorders , compared to a period of two hours with a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy became more than 12 weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with semi @-@ operated dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo that have been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients , in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which were linked by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in symptoms of patients by a standard method for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients that spoke to treatment were examined . &quot;
the company also led studies to investigate how the body resor@@ ted down the melting pot and the solution to the inser@@ tion .
&quot; in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients , A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms experienced than the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy has decreased in four of the five short @-@ time studies more effective than placebo . &quot;
A@@ bili@@ fy prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recur@@ r@@ ence of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment .
bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of gest@@ ural unrest and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects of A@@ bili@@ fy to take ( observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ por@@ ous disorders ( un@@ contro@@ ll@@ ability ) , ab@@ rupt ( nausea ) , ob@@ struction ( nausea ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness ( dis@@ grace ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from medium @-@ heavy to serious natural episodes in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes had to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the outcome that the advantages of inj@@ ecting in@@ consist@@ encies in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks . &quot;
June 2004 the European Commission announced the Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a permit for domestic use by A@@ bili@@ fy within the European Union .
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and for preventing a new Ottoman episode in patients indicated predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients more than 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; considering the greater sensitivity of these patients , a lower initi@@ al@@ dose should be considered if clinical factors should be justified ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ induc@@ tor is set off from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ il@@ ous behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased efficiency risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( M@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal or isch@@ a@@ emia , cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood@@ shed medicines ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ac@@ zel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ignant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies conducted a year or less , there were occasional reports of during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dy@@ mis , should be considered to reduce the dose or prevent the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that will indicate to a m@@ ns , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs must be dropped . &quot;
&quot; therefore Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with var@@ ic@@ uous waste in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states , which are related with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis that were associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , an increased stero@@ ids compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; there was however , in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the contact for undes@@ irable rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients infected with atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events associated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , which allow direct comparisons . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ them , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose values . &quot;
&quot; gaining weight increases in general in schizophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medicines , with which weight gain is known as side @-@ effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nerve system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with themselves super@@ imposed side effects such as se@@ dation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the resili@@ ence of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically not relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy proportions , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dos@@ is@@ ations . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result the common use with high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma @-@ concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ism .
&quot; considering the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the potential risks to the patient . &quot;
&quot; other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors from C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV prot@@ eas@@ ants , may have similar effects , and therefore similar dos@@ is@@ ations should be made . &quot;
&quot; according to the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dosage above the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
&quot; dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ z@@ ol@@ it@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology morph@@ ine ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( O@@ me@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of man and due to the concerns in human production studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk of fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , with other anti@@ psych@@ otic medication the patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to serve until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence . &quot;
the following side effects occurred more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the incidence of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks joined in patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ ising , a total of lesser incidence ( 25@@ ,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including par@@ ch@@ son@@ ism , ac@@ yst@@ em@@ ony and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients who have been treated with Hal@@ f@@ i@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % amoun@@ ted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % amoun@@ ted to patients infected with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ dic therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients under half @-@ operated treatment .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % amoun@@ ted to patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term development phase over 26 weeks when placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo treated patients .
a comparison between the patients groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and placebo when potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in routine @-@ controlled laboratory parameters came up there were no medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine phosph@@ ate ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , observed in 3.5 % of the patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects that may occur in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , the mal@@ ignant neuro@@ lep@@ tic syndrome , sp@@ ic@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the launch of market launch , un@@ intended or un@@ inten@@ tional over@@ dose are observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole alone with adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the effectiveness of a here@@ tical with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis has been beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high degree of plastic . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a - to the ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ in@@ ep@@ ad and for hist@@ amine H@@ 1@@ recipes .
&quot; in the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily over 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ stitutes , the Pos@@ it@@ et@@ ops @-@ E@@ missions Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction in the bond of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor lig@@ tor , at the Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and at the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a half @-@ operated study conducted in Week 52 of the share of Respon@@ ses patients , which contributed a response to the medicine medication , in both groups similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ f@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values made from Mess@@ ages , which were defined as secondary study , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger improvement than in Hal@@ f@@ dol . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia showed a significantly higher reduction in relap@@ se rate that was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study with schizophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which resulted in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( N = 18 or 13 % of the value @-@ value patients ) in significantly less patients ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approx . 7 % ) . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with more flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole a compared to placebo over@@ loaded effectiveness in the reduction of man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole to placebo not superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies of 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a compared with placebo over@@ le@@ genic effectiveness in week 3 and a clue effect that was comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ oper@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also referred to 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia in such as lithium or semi @-@ operated dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic Features , which partially over 2 weeks did not reflect upon Li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at Mon@@ otherapy in therapeu@@ tical order compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ ir@@ ation period over 74 weeks in Ottoman patients , who had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase against placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar relap@@ ses , predominantly in preventing a relap@@ se into the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the stretching and hydr@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ dation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole at exten@@ sive met@@ abol@@ ishing over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and with approximately 14@@ 6 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) met@@ abol@@ ism via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmaceuticals between male and female healthy proportions , as well as a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic investigation of schizophren@@ ia patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a non @-@ specific evaluation of Phar@@ o@@ ine@@ tics revealed no indication on clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the pharmaceuticals of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure compared to young healthy proportions .
&quot; a single dose study at Pro@@ ban@@ den with a col@@ oration of liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on the impairment of liver function to the phar@@ yn@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies for security forces , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; axi@@ ally significant effects were only observed in doses or positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited use only limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects are derived from a dos@@ is@@ tran@@ ge @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ant ( AU@@ C ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the 3@@ - up to 10@@ mg / kg ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended Maxim@@ ady @-@ State @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended maximum dose of men ( AU@@ C ) .
&quot; in addition , a chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis has been established as a result of the allevi@@ ation of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in the G@@ alle from monkey to 125 mg / kg / day ( the 1@@ - to 3@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose by humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in the human g@@ ays found in the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg doses of hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , not more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle by monkeys , and lie far under the limits ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; rab@@ bits were observed these effects according to dos@@ ages , which led to the positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ times of the middle Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended clinical Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis . &quot;

it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder about the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole amounts to 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily from meals .
patients who have difficulty in f@@ akes of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets can take the melting pot alternatively to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ il@@ ous behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole AU@@ C is in the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injections 90 % greater the AU@@ C after the gift of the same dose as a tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy proportions , the average time is up to reaching the maximum plastic carrier at 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injections was tolerated by rats and monkeys and resulted in no direct toxicity of a target @-@ organ with a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) which was 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum humane therapeutic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular .

&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) for security forces , toxicity , toxicity and can@@ cer@@ ous potential , the pre@@ clinical data had no particular dangers for man . &quot;
&quot; axi@@ ally significant effects were only observed in doses or positions , which clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; thus they have limited use only limited or no meaning for the clinical application . &quot;
the effects are derived from a dos@@ is@@ tran@@ ge @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ ant@@ acid ( AU@@ C ) for 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponds to the 3@@ - to 10 @-@ times the middle @-@ state @-@ exposure to female rats with 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 @-@ fold of the middle @-@ state @-@ exposure ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended maximum dose of people ) .

&quot; the effectiveness of my@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , at the 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer , some of which had received a anth@@ rac@@ er earlier than three quarters . &quot;
the effect of my@@ x@@ ane ( in all@@ u@@ ary or mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a drug with conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients with my@@ x@@ ane patients treated patients to the treatment of 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients , conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el included medicine . &quot;
&quot; if one considers only the patients treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , there was no difference to the efficacy of disease and survival , as far as to the deterioration of disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer in terms of these indicators that my@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
it may also not be applied to patients who are breastfeeding or prior to the treatment of low Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ sers in the blood .
the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) fixed that my@@ x@@ ane included patients with patients in which the initial treatment was no more effective than conventional P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el drugs and that it has to be given in contrast to other P@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el medicines and other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission granted the company Er@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited filed for approval by my@@ op@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;

Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems as further studies are required to make sure that this is caused by no allergic reactions .
&quot; the committee for human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of proof that the drug has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; symptoms of symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical trials and disease management is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in the hem@@ ost@@ hob@@ by@@ s by more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) for a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , occasionally in a patient can occasionally be observed in a patient individual tick @-@ shaped values or under the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot;

if the hem@@ ost@@ is bin@@ s more than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) exceeds 12 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;

&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it 33 - 39 % ) , in which the pre @-@ sufficient storage of ≥ 4 blood vessels should be required , Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight should be retained twice weekly for 3 weeks prior to operating procedure . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the iron substitution should be made as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ ologist blood@@ stream program - so that prior to the beginning of the se@@ amed therapy , great iron reserves are available . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage amounts to 600 i.e. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operating procedure and on the day of the operation ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.e. / kg every 10 consecutive days before , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given over the hose , followed by 10 ml is@@ oton@@ ous cooking solution to rin@@ se the hose and to ensure an adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
patients who suffer from treatment with any Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin ( see Section 4.@@ 4 - Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ st@@ open@@ ie ) . &quot;

the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity at sub@@ cut@@ aneous application from Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for anti @-@ body induc@@ ed PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 For patients with chronic kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be passed under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ ost@@ al concentration camp .
in clinical trials an increased risk of risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events have been observed if Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimulating agents ( ESA ) have been given by a hem@@ ost@@ ent@@ ure@@ - target concentration of more than 12 g / d@@ l ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have shown no significant benefits that can be attributed to the administration of epo@@ chs symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions and the avoidance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ an@@ rose should be approximately 1 g / d@@ l ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hypertension .
&quot; in case of patients with chronic kidney failure and clinical evi@@ dences , in@@ suffici@@ ency or storage in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ ost@@ asis target . &quot;
&quot; following this knowledge , through the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which is not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
for tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy should be considered for assessing the therapy efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ answer ( patients who may be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ B increase is greater than 2 g / d@@ l ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B @-@ value of 13 g / d@@ l ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must be adjusted to minimize the risk of possible thro@@ m@@ bar@@ gaining an@@ emia ( see Section 4.2 treatment of patients with chemical therapy @-@ related an@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim to hold the hem@@ at@@ glo@@ bin@@ s between 10 g / d@@ l and 12 g / d@@ l ) .
the decision for the use of re@@ combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ etine should be based on a utility risk taking into account the specific patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in case of patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , before the beginning of the epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia investigated and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a greater medical orthop@@ edic surgery , as they should have adequate Th@@ ro@@ ism prophy@@ la@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ at@@ botanical and vas@@ cular diseases , particularly in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that in treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting point of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an increased risk of post@@ operative arthritis / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ etine has not been proven to improve the overall survival with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or reduce the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer that was re@@ led to chemotherapy if a hem@@ ost@@ asis target range from 12 to 14 g / d@@ l ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l )
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in controls should be adjusted and the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ tees are adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it . &quot;
from in @-@ vit@@ ro investigations on tum@@ or@@ ge@@ ons there are no evidence of interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F with regard to hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation .

the com@@ mon@@ est side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ ot@@ ous increase of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ic .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see Section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ inen .
independent from the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin treatment it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ing to thro@@ m@@ bar@@ b@@ inger and vas@@ cular complications .
the GM epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ col in and with regard to the amino acids and the carbohydr@@ ate share is identical to the endo@@ genous human@@ ic ar@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ edic patients .
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ sh cells that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ ese and does not influence the leu@@ kop@@ o@@ ese .

survival and tumor trials were examined in five large @-@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blin@@ ded studies and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid Lyme disease patients and the patient &apos;s patient .
&quot; in these studies , the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ able human@@ ic Lyme disease patients with an an@@ a@@ emia due to various more common mal@@ ign@@ ancies showed an un@@ resolved , statisti@@ cally significant higher mortality than with the controls . &quot;
the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oses and related related complications in combined with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic disease patients and at controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk for thro@@ mbo@@ lic events in tum@@ or@@ ative events that can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ar@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results were treated to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ oid ar@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ or@@ pati@@ ently , which with chemotherapy is treated with the aim of transferring a hem@@ ost@@ hob@@ by@@ l under 13 g / d@@ l , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ provisions following repeti@@ tive intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours at healthy proportions and a somewhat extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections , the serv@@ itude of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the mirror levels that are achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no sorrow : the ser@@ um mirror remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
bone fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known comp@@ lication of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be attributed to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study by hem@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa were treated , the incidence of bone fibro@@ sis over the control group was treated with di@@ aly@@ sis , which were not raised with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;

a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ Gift and the desired effect should be considered for the assessment of the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of the red blood far@@ my@@ e ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose to match the risk of a blood boun@@ cing ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ anic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be very carefully weigh@@ ed against the benefits resulting from treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an elevated risk for thro@@ m@@ bar@@ b@@ vas@@ cular events , e.g. if you have been obes@@ e vas@@ cular events ( e.g. a deep ven@@ en@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis or lung disease ) . &quot;
&quot; in case you are cancer patients , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed as a growth factor for blood cells can affect and under certain circumstances the tumor can affect neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if you need a greater orthop@@ edic surgery , the treatment of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values are too high in the red blood @-@ offs ( hem@@ ost@@ glob@@ in ) , you should not get Ab@@ se@@ amed as an increased risk for bleeding after surgery . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is applied to the treatment of the following diseases : • oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease that makes the bone br@@ ittle ) both in women after men@@ opause and men .
&quot; it is applied in patients with a high cargo risk ( bone break@@ through@@ s ) , including patients who have recently suffered a less trau@@ matic cover , as when falling down , • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , an illness which changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be obtained from the first in@@ fusion a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means of inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms of disease in the three days following the in@@ fusion symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a only by doctors who have experience in treating this disease .
&quot; since the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a part of the data collection for Zom@@ eta was drawn up for the evaluation of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ ebr@@ ates and hat@@ s were investigated over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which suffered recently an abundance of frac@@ ture ; it was examined the number of questionn@@ aires over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was , whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ates in Ser@@ um ( an enzyme , the bone substance develops ) in the blood or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal cord in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis drugs ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis media ) with those under placebo the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most side @-@ effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less common with repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against customs acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates patients are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , the risk of kidney disease , reaction at the in@@ fusion site and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the j@@ aw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides educational material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , the evidence contains , as well as the similar material for patients , in which the side @-@ effects of the drug is explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in men a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion is recommended by 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a once a year .
&quot; in case of patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic cover , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended for two or more weeks after the operative care of the frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be prescribed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a only by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long R@@ emis@@ sion period was observed in patients who have addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to secure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic cover , an initi@@ al@@ dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by means of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
patients with kidney disease ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) In patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended as a limited clinical experience for this patient group .
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age because data is missing and efficacy .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney failure ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for these patient population only limited clinical experiences .
an existing hypo@@ kal@@ an@@ emia is to treat an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the quick setup of the effect of customs acid at bone structure , a temporary , occasionally symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to secure in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , accordingly twice a day at least 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days following the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer disease , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , poor oral hygiene , should be used in front of an application of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients who require dental treatment , no data is available , whether the interruption of the treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the j@@ aw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , can be reduced by means of acet@@ am@@ in@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of un@@ brid@@ led cases was reported in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 0.@@ 6 % ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
in oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( P@@ FT @-@ H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al wor@@ sen between A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.@@ 1 % ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , unwanted drug impacts are listed in table 1 . &quot;
kidney vas@@ cular disorders has been associated with kidney dys@@ functions ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as ak@@ y of kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( annually before administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were compared in a clinical trial at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years comparable between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .

effects on morph@@ ometric spine of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as after one year the incidence of one or more new spinal bodies ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spinal cord compared to placebo @-@ patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
effects on frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed an equal lasting effect over three years that result in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI - 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk for stro@@ kes .

the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment conducted more than 24 months compared to placebo treatment by 5.2 % on the total epitheli@@ um and at 4.3 % on the Schen@@ kel@@ h@@ als .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ised to 50@@ 8 men and assessed BM@@ D after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) , the once yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was compared with the once weekly Gift of Al@@ cl@@ ast@@ on@@ ate compared to the percentage change in the steering @-@ wir@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to the current value . &quot;

&quot; 11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of customs acid , compared to the intake of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months has been proven in two six months comparison studies . &quot;
&quot; in the combined results , after 6 months a similar decrease of pain strength and pain influence was observed in comparison to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ sible studies at the end of the six @-@ month study ( on the therapy had mentioned ) could be included in an observ@@ able phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at treated patients suffering from the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response could be maintained in 141 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared to 71 of the duration of the after@@ math of 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multi @-@ time 5 and 15 minutes continuous in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of customs @-@ acid at 64 patients &quot; &quot; pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dos@@ is@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rose quickly from at &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;

&quot; the early stages of pregnancy ( α and β , with the above -@@ ½ values ) , probably represent the rapid res@@ or@@ ption in the bones , and the ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys . &quot;
in the first 24 h 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose in urine while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue .
&quot; the total @-@ body Clear@@ ance is independent from the dose 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clearance by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentration on time ) .
a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance from Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabolic substances is unlikely because customs acid at humans are not metabo@@ li@@ zed and because they are a watch@@ ful or not direct and / or mis@@ sive , metabolism @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patient groups ( see Section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al Clear@@ ance of the Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ c acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance - 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance and amoun@@ ted to 64 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) .
this follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate kidney dysfunction up to 35 ml / min does not require dosage adjustment of the tariff acid .
as for heavy ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are available for this population .
acute toxicity The highest not let@@ al intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous lon@@ d@@ osis was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and in rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; studies in dogs were given individual d@@ oses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al control . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxicity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered up by 0.1 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion at intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which covers the 7@@ 4,000 of the human @-@ therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C ( corresponds ) , well tolerated . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EC@@ PA@@ R for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Relations Department ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) has been judged to get recommendations regarding the application of drug use . &quot;
ac@@ tos is used for the treatment of type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as in@@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( in particular obes@@ e medicine ) . • It can be applied together with another Di@@ abet@@ es@@ drug medicine ( Du@@ al@@ Therap@@ y ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in patients ( in particular , overweight patients ) can be applied with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ ic acid or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ ic acid or insulin can be retained with the beginning of the ac@@ ic treatment ( low blood sugar ) , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of sul@@ fon@@ ic acid or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body needs to be improved in better , and the blood sugar levels decreases , thus causing type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients examined the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ otherapy , the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ ic acid , in addition they received either ac@@ tos or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ at@@ ine , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; accounts led to a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ ranking , which allows the blood sugar to be reduced in application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ otherapy study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of accounts and insulin in 2@@ 89 patients were examined , the patients , the accounts in addition to insulin , compared with 0.@@ 14 % after 6 months , compared with 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally recorded placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with ac@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cold cuts ) , weight gain and hypo@@ a@@ esthesia ( dimin@@ ishing sensitivity to irritation ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos can not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic K@@ eto@@ ov@@ ine ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that ac@@ tos in the context of mon@@ otherapy ( in any use ) is intended to serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in patients , in which met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited registered a permit for domestic accounts within the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , approximately , curved and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also displayed for combining insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin , and in which met@@ form@@ ities is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients infected by the presence at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of a dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or oils , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight loss and oils , when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart failure , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output @-@ liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror can be lifted up to 3 @-@ times the upper limit of the standard area , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control once again . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that point to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vom@@ iting , thi@@ ghs , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or darker res@@ n , are the liver enzymes . &quot;
the decision whether the patient &apos;s treatment continues with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be directed until the pres@@ ences of the laboratory parameters from the clinical assessment .
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven that is linked by fatty deposits , and in some cases , is associated with hydr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ at@@ ant , under the therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a slight reduction in the middle hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed at compar@@ atively controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of the hem@@ ost@@ al bin@@ s around 3 @-@ 4 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.@@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin @-@ sensitivity to patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as or@@ ale branch or tri@@ parti@@ san therapy with insulin therapy , the risk of dos@@ is@@ otic hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of the market , under the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , has been reported via a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ o@@ ath with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms , although patients should report on disrup@@ tions of visual acu@@ ity ; a proper oph@@ thal@@ mic declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
the projected freight incidence was 1,@@ 9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years with the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to women and 1.@@ 1 frac@@ tures for women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients infected with a comparison medication . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient desires pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is to be used ( see Section 4.6 ) .
studies on the study of interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmaceuticals or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ tom@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicinal products which are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ le@@ mer are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for the 3 @-@ fold application .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction of AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy hyper@@ insulin and increased insulin resistance and thus reduces the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates to the feder@@ ate growth .
&quot; very often &gt; 1 / 10 ; frequently &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from present data cannot be invaluable ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change of the tur@@ g@@ ors and the brake inde@@ xes of the lens , as it can also be observed with other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ lt occurred equal to the triple of the standard area as frequently as under placebo , but more rarely than in comparison @-@ groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl . &quot;
&quot; in a Out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease , the incidence of severe cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was compared to 1.6 % higher than under placebo when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since its launch has rarely been reported via cardi@@ ac in@@ suffici@@ ency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has been used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years of running pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) patients with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; on intake of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days , no symptoms occurred . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to act on an activation of specific nuclear con@@ ept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) that leads to an increased insulin @-@ sensitivity of liver , fats and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peri@@ ph@@ ere gluten in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time to rep@@ lic@@ ting the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8.@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients treated under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) can be maintained . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar were random@@ ized despite three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin in insufficient to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced - value by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to patients who continues to be treated only insulin ; a reduction of insulin in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one demonstrated a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week examination of type @-@ 2 diabe@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials , in comparison to placebo a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ cem@@ eries and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as slightly , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ h@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
compared to placebo in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels were determined while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de dimin@@ ished values were observed .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks of the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tri@@ gl@@ yp@@ ole @-@ absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gl@@ yp@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ized with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing ma@@ kro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti @-@ diabe@@ tic therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the top con@@ centric Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can be reached in general 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is the effectiveness of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ ac@@ tional studies , that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical or pharmac@@ eu@@ dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in exercises . &quot;
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Gem@@ fibro@@ us ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) or lo@@ wers the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ er Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the Mar@@ ker was mainly found in f@@ eces ( 55 % ) and to a lower extent in the resin ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the average plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation period of un@@ altered pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is at the age of 5 @-@ 6 hours , and the total active met@@ abol@@ ites is 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ abol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function , but the ration@@ ales of the loc@@ ale Clear@@ ance of the parent but resem@@ ble themselves . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ ological studies occurred with mice , rats , dogs and apes , after repeated administration of plasma @-@ volume with ha@@ g , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in the creation of hyper@@ insulin @-@ emia and increased insulin resistance , thus reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for the federal growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) have induc@@ ed increased inci@@ dences of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( at male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
in a animal model of the family @-@ like poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) performed the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ones to an increased frequency of colon@@ ization .
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wear on one side the mark@@ er &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the wording &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS . &quot;
the projected freight incidence was 1,@@ 9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years with the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on to women and 1.@@ 1 frac@@ tures for women treated with a comparison medication . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients infected with a comparison medication . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with each pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de have been studied .
in clinical trials over 1 year at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one demonstrated a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ ine / Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Qu@@ oti@@ ent compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks of the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ cem@@ an absorption and the hep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was l@@ acked the goal with regard to its primary end , a combination of overall mental , non @-@ fatal cor@@ on@@ ar@@ synchron@@ isation , com@@ amp@@ utation above the ank@@ le , coron@@ ary re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization of the leg arteries , put the results close with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and no cardiovascular risk @-@ related risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , flat and wearing one side the mark@@ er &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the wording &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of messages unwanted events relating to bone bro@@ o@@ ds from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8,@@ 400 patients who were treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , showed an increased incidence of bone bro@@ o@@ ds in women . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study of 3.5 years for the investigation of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ; 1.@@ 0 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) with patients infected with a comparison medication . &quot;

the study was measured after 12 weeks of concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ at@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ Spi@@ der , which pointed out that blood sugar levels were significantly reduced to other human rights . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an should not be used in patients , who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human rights ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , doses of acet@@ aph@@ an may need to be adapted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is the package location ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ aph@@ ane in the treatment of diabetes are ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the risks .
&quot; October 2002 , the European Commission announced the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for authorisation from Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; mixed insulin products are usually used once or twice daily , if a quick initial effect will be desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
injections must be reduced at least 6 seconds under the skin to make sure the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar can be significantly improved , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms can be perceived and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , Insul@@ in@@ ty@@ p ( quickly real , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , human , or insulin method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin , origin ) can result in that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; when changing to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ an in the patient is required , it may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions occurred after a change from animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; travelling across multiple time zones , the patient should be advised to obtain the advice of his physician , as such voy@@ ages may lead to other times applied or taken . &quot;
the doctor has therefore to consider possible interactions in therapy and ask for their patients to other medicines .

&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the active maximum will be reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;

&quot; if the ur@@ inary bars lie after two to four weeks still over 6 mg per de@@ il@@ iter , the dose can be increased once daily 120 mg once daily . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months still toxicity may occur , therefore , that patients will be at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic or further drugs to contrac@@ eption of tox@@ ics . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant since it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of thre@@ e@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to a placebo ( search@@ engine ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Adenauer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of 300 mg daily ; patients with kidney problems were given only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary ro@@ ar in the blood was below the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 by 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who received the aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients , which took over every day 120 mg , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary bar in the blood of below 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to that , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of the patients under al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in no one of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , there is also an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the committee for human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary ur@@ st epitheli@@ um in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to pri@@ mor@@ abl@@ ations ( including one out of the medical history known or date present day g@@ ate@@ es and / or a Gi@@ cht@@ arthritis ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acul@@ um bars after 2 @-@ 4 weeks are still &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in case of patients with severe kidney disease , the effectiveness and safety have not been completely investigated yet ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people since there are no experiences in children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; organic transplan@@ ts As made available any experience with Organ@@ izer , the application of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases in patients with isch@@ a@@ ical heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure is not recommended for treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ secular medicines , it can occur during the treatment course to a acute tox@@ in , because by lowering the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ine@@ tic epitheli@@ um in the tissues to be mobili@@ zed . &quot;

liver diseases Dur@@ ing the clinical trials of phase 3 became slight abnorm@@ alities of the liver function@@ alities to be observed in with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to carry out a liver functionality before the start of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and in the further course depending on the sound@@ ing process ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line in Z@@ was were not performed in@@ effective studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to a rise in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ( a inhi@@ bit of the met@@ alli@@ zation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line ) .

&quot; experimental studies do not leave direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when purchasing a vehicle , serve machines or in the exercise of dangerous activities , until they may be somewhat certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has not influenced their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ically higher incidence of obtained from the exam@@ iner @-@ related events has been observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ u@@ x group compared to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in comparison to the Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol group in comparison to Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 1,4 versus 0.@@ 7 events per 100 patient years ) although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no col@@ lateral connection with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at were found .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ kt or a de@@ compensated heart failure in health history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) side effects that could be found in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act Study as described below ) , which were performed with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia and gyp@@ sum . &quot;
the primary focus point was in every study the proportion of patients with which the last three month has been determined by certain serv@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ine@@ ties &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a ser@@ um kre@@ p@@ ation to study course of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed between 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) 1 x daily compared with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with traditional doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study showed statisti@@ cally significant superiority of the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with the conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg daily .
patients with Ser@@ um@@ kre@@ p@@ in@@ able &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summar@@ ized for the analyses . * p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0,@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
the reduction of the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ine@@ es@@ pi@@ d to &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed at the doctor &apos;s visit to week 2 and permanently maintain the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um kre@@ p@@ able &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with ren@@ al dys@@ functionality The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney disease .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary focus point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patient . &quot;
&quot; there were no clinical significant differences with regard to the percentage of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aven@@ ues in pro@@ ban@@ den , regardless of their ren@@ al function ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ con@@ centric ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of the patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act Study ) had a ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ese @-@ cent@@ re@@ ation of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years of an open extension study of phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ar @-@ bars found in &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients were needed in the months 16 @-@ 24 treatment against a g@@ love chu@@ ck ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients needed no treatment against a g@@ love ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the toxicity size , which in 54 % of the patients had a complete disappearance of the g@@ ills up to the month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term treatment studies ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; for healthy volunteers , the maximum plas@@ tic@@ concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation period ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of between 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ mic increase . &quot;
after taking simple or multi @-@ multiple doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3.@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , not a clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage fall in the ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ese de@@ centr@@ ation was observed , provided that this was checked ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady @-@ state @-@ department volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plastic carrier of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approx . 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) , and is reached via the concentration width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro @-@ studies at human liver enzymes , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 showed that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 are formed and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;

&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine , approximately 45 % of the dose found itself as an imm@@ utable F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) as well as other unknown metals ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special patient @-@ groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After the intake of multiple mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney failure is not changing the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in proportion to pro@@ ban@@ ds with normal kidney function . &quot;
the average total AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at took about the 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ g in the group with normal kidney function to 13.@@ 2 μ in the group with severe kidney function .
12 liver functionality after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with easier ( chil@@ d@@ - Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or medium @-@ severe ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restric@@ ts itself changed the C@@ max and AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites does not significantly reduce compared to pro@@ ban@@ ds with normal liver function .

these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and urine @-@ composition and for clinical use as not relevant to clinical use .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ ical doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproductive power of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE will be used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause in which a risk for a low vitamin D mirror is made .
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking another medicine ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irritation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separately used in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company entered data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to interpret the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D Group .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D in patients were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who took exclusively Al@@ en@@ dr@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also laid data in front of the data that included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , which is exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal ( ul@@ ence , bone or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive apparatus , Dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ e ( diar@@ rhea ) , ul@@ cers ( lo@@ bites ) , ul@@ cers ( pu@@ zz@@ l@@ ter belly ) as well as aci@@ di@@ pl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in patients with one @-@ level hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other constitu@@ ents may not be applied as AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in diseases of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low level of calcium ) or in patients who can &apos;t stand up or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or taking medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following notes are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk for solution @-@ ha@@ vo@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not be made up before the first food intake of the day , which should be charged at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;

&quot; the doctor will therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms to point out to all signs and symptoms that should be advised on possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ic reactions , and patients should be advised to pick up the drug or retro@@ mental pain , or new or become more lim@@ mer@@ ry so@@ d@@ burn and get medical advice ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe trau@@ matic side effects appears to be increased in patients who do not take the drug correctly , and / or it after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation . &quot;
it is very important that all do@@ atisation instructions are passed to the patient and may be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large scale clinical studies with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no higher risk was determined , rarely ( after the launch ) stomach and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

patients should be reli@@ ant that they should take the pill by taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet in the next morning after having noticed their om@@ issions .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but taking the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the week@@ day . &quot;
other illnesses that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequately before the onset of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; alkal@@ ine foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the Res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
therefore patients must wait after the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ at at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; although specific Inter@@ ac@@ tional studies were not carried out , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken jointly with a multitude of commonly prescribed medicines , without the fact that the clin@@ ically relevant interactions occurred . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only intended for use in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and therefore should not be used either during pregnancy or breastfeeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not leave any indication of harmful effects in terms of pregnancy that recognize the embryonic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

in the two @-@ year extension of these studies the sei@@ zur@@ es of the BM@@ D of spine and Tro@@ chan@@ ter continued to continue ; the BM@@ D of the Fem@@ ur@@ hal@@ ses and the entire body was maintained .
&quot; fit consisted of two pl@@ az@@ ebo@@ controlled trials , where Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 mg daily either above 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
&quot; in this study , the daily gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on reduced the appearance of at least a new spine to 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo . 0,@@ 0 % ) . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption referred to a intraven@@ ous reference dosage , the medium oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was 0.@@ 64 % for cans between 5 and 70 mg after a stand@@ ardis@@ ed fasting and two hours before the start of a stand@@ ardis@@ ed breakfast . &quot;

&quot; at oste@@ opor@@ osis estu@@ aries , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if at least 30 minutes prior to the first meal or drinking of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy pro@@ ban@@ den , the Gift of oral Pre@@ d@@ nis@@ on ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) is not a clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the average of 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;

&quot; since the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been used in the EU , the company has submitted the results from earlier studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the use of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , in which the transplan@@ tation was taken after a treatment duration of one year ( by examining for example , how often a renewed organ transp@@ l@@ ant or a revival of the di@@ aly@@ sis was required ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further studies of 119 patients were carried out with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and investigated as Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with reli@@ ant hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken at the same time with Ad@@ vag@@ raf , since the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose or the dose of the medication may be adjusted accordingly . &quot;

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should submit this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us this can lead to transp@@ ires or to increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immune system . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wing control of an experienced medical group ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a conversion to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to make sure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ating and toler@@ ability in individual case and on blood @-@ level regulations ( see below )
&quot; after conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a mirror mirror , with both form@@ ulations both in kidney and le@@ ased patients comparable . &quot;
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeated controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low clearing , can last a adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as several days before the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; in case the condition of the patient in the first post@@ operative phase does not allow oral treatment of drugs , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment may be introduced ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrations for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of the application Z@@ ur repression of the transplan@@ tation must maintain the immune system ; consequently , consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ant treatment should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dosage adjustment can be later required since the phar@@ ma ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transp@@ l@@ ant treatment should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dose recommendations - conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be put forward a transp@@ onder of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules on once daily intake of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ raf , so this conversion has to be made in proportion 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a conversion of other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily needs to begin treatment with each l@@ actic and liver transplan@@ tation for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation .
&quot; heart transp@@ l@@ ant For adult patients , which are placed on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initiation dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day at once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ tation receiver , although there are no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary and col@@ lo@@ op@@ transplan@@ ted patients , patients of 0.2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal transplan@@ ts in an oral initiation of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
tin adap@@ tations in special patient @-@ groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood tal@@ kers in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a dose of dose .
patients with reduced ren@@ al function because the kidney function does not affect the phar@@ yn@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required .
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of ser@@ um pancre@@ at@@ ine levels , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
conversion of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In the conversion of a Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations regarding the level of blood in full blood The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ ating and toler@@ ability in the individual case , under the aid of whole blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ level control controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us levels during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled according to conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , dosage adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or at the simultaneous use of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full bleeding . ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a medicine with a low clearing , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical trials allow that a successful treatment is possible in most cases , if the levels are not exceed the blood level in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
in clinical practice the final levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are usually in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and during the period of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in patients with 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac transplan@@ ts were generally used blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this resulted in severe unwanted events , including transplan@@ ts or other side @-@ effects which can occur in a row of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the appropriate daily dosage ; ren@@ ditions of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wing control of an experienced medical doctor ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 Z@@ ur treatment for adult patients with transplan@@ tation , which proved to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as a therapy @-@ resistant , are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
for prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation with adult heart transplan@@ ts and transp@@ l@@ ant in the chin @-@ age there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded formulation ad@@ vag@@ raf .
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other herbal remedies during treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly me@@ tic@@ ulous monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , among pro@@ gra@@ f one was used as Lyme disease or sep@@ t@@ onal tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such sound@@ ing disorders , are an already existing heart suffering , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the exposure of sunlight or UV light should be restricted by suitable clothes or use of a solar protection via a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who occupy the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , symptoms for Pr@@ es such as headaches , changed consciousness levels , cro@@ iss@@ ors and visual impair@@ ments should show a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hart@@ kap@@ sel , de@@ uses , l@@ act@@ ose , is offered in patients with the rare her@@ act@@ ose electro@@ act@@ ose in@@ tolerant , l@@ act@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ mal@@ act@@ ose @-@ mal@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies which are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and therefore lower the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
therefore it is recommended that the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood levels at the same gift of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintain equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; a strongly influenced interaction was made with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiotic o@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies studies , that the increase in blood levels primarily resulted from the increased bio@@ availability of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal inter@@ change@@ over@@ s . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as it is used in acute de@@ ton@@ ations , can increase or reduce the concentration of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower . &quot;
&quot; effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors ; therefore , the simultaneous use of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is metabo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , whose metabolism can affect the metabolism . &quot;
since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us down the Clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive and therefore can increase hormonal exposure is particularly careful in decisions about receptive at@@ tainment measures .
the results of animal try shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us potentially reduce the Clear@@ ance of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their semi @-@ value .
&quot; the results of a small number of research to transp@@ l@@ ant patients do not provide any indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , there is an increased risk of unwanted events relating to the course and result of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; at uter@@ o exposure , there is a monitoring of the newborn to potential harmful effects of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;

&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high bond of Er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ m@@ ap@@ rot@@ one can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII conditional , inn@@ ate blood vessels ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application will be directed to whether Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes blood problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but after a method that is called &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union &apos;s approved medicines called Re@@ public@@ ate , but it is quite different , so that drug contains no proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients with severe to medium @-@ severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined in the prevention of bleeding , as well as surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the effectiveness of Adv@@ entures in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood sep@@ tic sep@@ ets was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any other components . &quot;
&quot; March 2004 , the European Commission announced the Company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG for approval by Adv@@ ate in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of the substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency according to the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient .
&quot; in the following mor@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VIII activity in the appropriate period is not intended to sink under the indicated plasma level ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impairment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the danger for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment course , it is recommended for controlling the dose and the frequency of injections to proper provision of the factor VIII @-@ plasma level . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo Recovery and show different semi @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII plastic activity is not achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed if necessary a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective so that other therapeutic measures have to be weigh@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the travel speed should be directed after the patient , whereby the maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atorial activity of factor VIII directed Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma .
&quot; the risk of developing in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors is cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ positioning is on the largest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ positions and an@@ am@@ nesty , well @-@ known In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ development was observed , after conversion from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the recur@@ r@@ ence of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare test of the hem@@ ophi@@ lia A among women lie on the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and lac@@ tation , no experience before . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ bern &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who had previously untreated patients with a higher risk to formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10 ) , is not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;

&quot; in previously , patients of an ongoing clinical study made 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE patients infected patients infected by factor VIII . &quot;
the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analyzed by the study of antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant increase , as well as an ongoing Peak of the anti@@ body cell against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise , there were no signs or symptoms resulting in an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since initial data , the CH@@ MP has been valued as positive , but considering that the safety profile for the following reasons must be closely monitored : &quot;
&quot; thus , the CH@@ MP is required on the basis of the security profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which requires a filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided that the approval was to apply for a further extension in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited , the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) officially distributed the company to withdraw its application for approval by Adv@@ ant@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; however , the breasts , the brain , the bones , or the course @-@ parts ( tissues which connects other structures in the body , surrounds and rests ) thereof . &quot;
&quot; it is a type of virus that has been genetically modified , that there can be a gene into the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; &quot; Adenauer &quot; &quot; that has changed so that it cannot produce copies of itself , thus creating no infections in humans . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been sc@@ anned directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein that is made from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , is usually used to restore damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer , in which the p@@ 53 gene is faul@@ ty , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company entered data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , into the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had reviewed the answers to the company , some questions were still un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the initial documentation on the initial documentation , the CH@@ MP issued a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP opinion , it has not been sufficiently demonstrated that the injection of Adv@@ ant@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors will bring benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the way of administration , and the safety of drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not proven sufficient that Adv@@ ant@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company was not aware of the CH@@ MP whether the recovery has consequences for patients , who are currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ mentary @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ant@@ in . &quot;
&quot; changing reality &quot; means &quot; means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective ingredients are released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours is released . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len prot@@ ru@@ ined inflammation of the nose paths ) in patients with nose @-@ sli@@ pper@@ y nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young adults from 12 years onwards , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily to be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and termin@@ ated as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ sli@@ p ( pet@@ ri@@ fied nose ) , are sealed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be re@@ activated on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective dimensions were the changes in the severity of the ha@@ y symptoms that were reported by the patients before the beginning of the treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients received their symptoms every 12 hours into a diary and evaluated with a standard scale as difficult for symptoms in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all Heu@@ vel@@ ing symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients who took their aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % , compared with the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ sli@@ ce was considered , the patients under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a allevi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who took des@@ lor@@ ry in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed with 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die ( cardi@@ ac combustion ) , irritation , headaches , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ni@@ ol@@ ence , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may be attributed to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ ic@@ ul@@ ators or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ kel@@ glau@@ coma ( higher eye pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular diseases ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ ose ( over@@ function of the thy@@ roid ) , or have already had a risk for a hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted the SP SP Europe for approval by aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it is possible to swal@@ low it ( i.e. without it to cr@@ ush or che@@ wing ) . &quot;
aer@@ op@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under 12 years due to mis@@ understanding and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is to keep as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
it is recommended to limit the application duration for 10 days because in long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take over time .
&quot; according to the swelling of the mu@@ cos@@ a in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients infected with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after completion of such treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ bage , dop@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ Phr@@ in , Eph@@ edr@@ ine , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin , etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collectively and the data does not range to speak appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze have not been tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder and the data does not range to speak appropriate recommendations for the dosage .
&quot; patients must be informed about that treatment at the occurrence of a hyper@@ ton@@ ic or t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or of p@@ ach@@ s , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a rein@@ forcement of head@@ ache ) must be set . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , the caution is given to caution : • patients under D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • patients with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • patients with hypertension , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder so@@ b@@ alism or bronze in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before implementing the mat@@ ological test , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka otherwise prevent positive responses to indicators for hood actions or reduce their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been given , however , no clinical @-@ relevant interactions or changes in the Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , there could be no significant differences between the patients treated with disaster and those treated with placebo regardless of whether Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
it has not yet been identified for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible enzymes so that interactions with other medicines could not be entirely ruled out .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that drugs C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are not inhi@@ bited and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed to experience experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however no increase in frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population .
as reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases it can come to a stup@@ er that can lead to impairment of traffic bol@@ ting or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , Cypri@@ an@@ ose , cardiovascular collapse ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ m@@ ations , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions , con@@ vul@@ sions . &quot;

&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially probable in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ ill@@ en@@ rigi@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ net , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ x@@ or@@ ischen cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the im@@ itation of expression of the Ad@@ der@@ sion@@ ol@@ molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the rein@@ forcement of subjective neg@@ ation or the tasks that are associated with flying . &quot;
controlled clinical trials were found at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of beats compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a tick @-@ cardi@@ ac or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ am@@ in@@ antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determines based on the overall cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nose @-@ sli@@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the vibr@@ ating effect determines based on the nose @-@ sli@@ pping effect was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period .
the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups . &quot;
as part of a single @-@ dose study on Phar@@ o@@ ine@@ tics by Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma .
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ inal application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze at healthy pro@@ ban@@ den over 14 days , the fly @-@ weight of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and pseudo @-@ edr@@ ine in the day 10 was achieved . &quot;
&quot; as part of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ disciplinary study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ den , has been found that four pro@@ ban@@ den Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in poorly tolerated . &quot;
an components inter@@ acting study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in bio@@ equivalent was exposure to the gift of an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on the conventional studies for security forces , toxicity in repeti@@ tions , toxicity and reproduction , pre@@ clinical data can be recognized with disaster relief , however , no particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
the combination does not have greater toxicity than its individual components and the observed effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine .
&quot; in reproductive medicine , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was the combination of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ ato@@ gen . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was investigated in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies on seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of p@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment was determined . &quot;
&quot; there were further studies submitted to verify that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to the inser@@ tion and the melting pot in the same way as the tablets and the use with children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies have been assembled , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of the symptom ( symptom score ) at 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; January 2001 , the European Commission approved the European Commission for approval by A@@ eri@@ us within the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ance and pers@@ isti@@ cal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and pri@@ ori@@ aria ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
limited experience from clinical studies on effectiveness in the use of disaster relief in young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous disease procedure and may end after the end of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed at their recur@@ r@@ ence .
the patient &apos;s allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( incidence of symptoms to 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients throughout the aller@@ gen period .
&quot; clinical @-@ related interactions have been found in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in tablets , in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered ( see below 5.1 ) . &quot;
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study was not ampli@@ fied by A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the powerful effect of alcohol ( see below 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be elu@@ ci@@ dated , however , that in very rare cases it can come to di@@ zz@@ iness that can lead to impairment of traffic bol@@ ting or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently asked side effects which was reported more frequently than with placebo , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral drying ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common side effects of headaches , this occurred at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in and with 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi@@ disciplinary study , administered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clinical @-@ relevant effects have been observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro@@ x@@ or@@ ischen cy@@ to@@ k@@ inen such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the im@@ itation of expression of the Ad@@ der@@ sion@@ ol@@ ec@@ ol@@ molecule P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi@@ disciplinary , in which a dosage administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in is administered in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of the clinical dose ) over ten days , showed no extension to the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; with an individual dos@@ is@@ - study involving adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the rein@@ forcement of subjective neg@@ ation or the tasks that are associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ch@@ iness , tr@@ ench and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch@@ iness on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified depending on the duration of the symptoms , or in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isti@@ fied allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the incidence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ isti@@ fied allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the incidence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown on the basis of the total cor@@ es of the questionnaire for the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Con@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively dimin@@ ished by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria has been investig@@ ating for further forms of pri@@ ori@@ aria as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology regardless of the e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms is similar and chronic patients can be recru@@ ited easier .
&quot; since the hist@@ am@@ in@@ fre@@ t is a caus@@ tic factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ular diseases , it is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in besides the chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria is also present in other forms of pri@@ ori@@ aria to an improvement in symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies of 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first tin .
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ amine in chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the minority of patients who are not re@@ acted to Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in treated patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of the sleep and the wax considerably , as was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a Phar@@ m@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were allergic to the general seasonal rhet@@ oric , in 4 % of patients , a higher concentration of disaster relief was achieved in 4 % of patients . &quot;
there are no indications for a clin@@ ically relevant Kum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. shared with the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) officially stated that the company takes its application for approval for the In@@ fl@@ un@@ ov in the prevention of avi@@ ary h@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people for the protection against flu caused by strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special type of vaccine being protected against a trunk of influenza virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic .
&quot; influenza pan@@ demic breaks out when a new strain of influenza virus is emerging , which can easily spread from man to man , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system re@@ alizes the immune system contained in the vaccine as &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
this makes the immune system later able to form a contact with a flu @-@ virus this gene@@ alo@@ on more quickly .
&quot; subsequently , the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus with the &quot; surface @-@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recognizes the human body as body @-@ strange ) , cleared up and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA for pre @-@ pan@@ demic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to participate in clinical trials and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information on the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which is caused by human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency virus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is caused by the acquired Imm@@ une De@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swal@@ low the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to taking , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r as the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only then be en@@ acted when the doctor has tested , which anti @-@ viral medicines the patient has previously taken , and the likelihood is that the virus is addressed to the drug . &quot;
the recommended dose for patients over twelve years amounts to 600 mg twice daily along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a weight weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase reduces HIV @-@ amounts in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS cannot cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system and also delay the development of HIV / AIDS infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adult who had previously not been treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this boo@@ sted Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicine A@@ gener@@ ase was compared with 20@@ 6 adults , which had previously taken previously prot@@ eas@@ ants , with other prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the viral load after the treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ esters previously , after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than under placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; with children decreased A@@ gener@@ ase also the Vir@@ us@@ last , however , by the children who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , were very few in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults , who had been treated earlier with prot@@ eas@@ ants , lowered the Vir@@ us@@ last after 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase to a stronger waste of the Vir@@ al last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin @-@ out and Fatima gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r or any other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is also not allowed to be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines which are just like A@@ gener@@ ase and are harmful in high concentrations in the blood of health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , the A@@ gener@@ ase is taking , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ ologi@@ ph@@ y ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , a oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection caused by the immune system of immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the advantages of A@@ gener@@ ase in use with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines used to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee argued that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase have been taken in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously had no prot@@ eas@@ ants , not proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; as the approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission granted the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited filed for approval by A@@ gener@@ acy across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) for adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sts are administered together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r should take place under consideration of the individual viral support and pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ bled avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ take is 14 % less than from am@@ bush avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ zur@@ es / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ zur@@ es which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the pharmaceutical , efficacy and safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the mis@@ conception of data on the im@@ memorial and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients suffering from severe liver disorders to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be carried with caution when suffering with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements included in the cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk of reduced plasma @-@ con@@ centric and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for usually , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have increased risk for heavy liver interactions with potentially fatal course . &quot;
for the event of an simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C please read the specific information contained in this medicine .
patients with existing restricted liver function including chronic hepatitis hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver abnorm@@ alities under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ o@@ co@@ ids , which are mistaken over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs the risk of systemic Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid of effects including mor@@ bus Cus@@ hing and sup@@ pression of the adren@@ al function ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the frac@@ turing of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ine with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or vital side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective due to decreased plasma level of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r may be altered the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive , however , the information is not sufficient to appreciate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with am@@ bush avi@@ r at the same time , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ane@@ ously symptoms , especially if also low doses can be administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxicity due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in the A@@ gener@@ ational solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patients groups . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ eas@@ ants , was reported via the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an Ex@@ ac@@ her@@ edi@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases related to their therapy drugs were associated with the development of a diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in lam@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , the reports were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports on an increase of blood vessels including spontaneous cut@@ ters and hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , a inflammatory reaction may develop on as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fac@@ torial Equ@@ ino@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune , higher body @-@ measure index ) , cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term waste of anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with minimal therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase may not be given simultaneously with drugs which possess a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with minimal therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be combined together with drugs whose active substances are mainly associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are related to the increased plas@@ m@@ asp@@ es with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ bush avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to equi@@ p the degra@@ ded plastic bars by a dosage increase by other prot@@ esters inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects were observed in the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s per@@ for@@ atum ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ ving mirror of am@@ bled avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
if a patient takes already Johann@@ is@@ we@@ eds are the am@@ bled mirror levels and if possible to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and prevent the cur@@ rant .
a dosage adjustment for one of the drugs is not required if Nel@@ dar@@ avi@@ r is administered together with am@@ dur@@ avi@@ r ( see also em@@ avi@@ r@@ ence below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ bush avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies dos@@ ages of 600 mg am@@ bled avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and in@@ consistency of this treatment schem@@ atic . &quot;
52 % degra@@ ding if amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg / Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) administered .
&quot; the C@@ min &apos;s values of am@@ bled avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg li@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ osing intake for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , it is recommended a eng@@ masch@@ ige surveillance as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , but it is recommended due to the anta@@ zi@@ di component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ ase is at least one hour ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in the gift of avi@@ r@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ bush avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) No Dos@@ is@@ adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ bled avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in to other prot@@ eas@@ ants and existing limited data leave suspected that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the ser@@ um concentration of am@@ bled avi@@ r may possibly lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advised because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din might be less effective because of the decreased / or perhaps sub@@ therapeutic bars . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ bled avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of am@@ bled avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the associated with Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will fall at least half of the recommended dose for at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceuticals in combination with er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , however , the plasma units of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ bled avi@@ r and 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in C@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol only daily compared to the value which was observed after 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without the simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ bled avi@@ r by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below are also sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ or or in@@ duction of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly cause interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be linked to toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs when applied in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ants it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da will not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , since it can come to resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ tures , known as enzyme ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ bush avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of plas@@ tic@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium det@@ achments such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Nic@@ ot@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ os@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ bush and toxicity of these drugs . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plastic con@@ centric and increase with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction of side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ stitutes , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ann@@ ank ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with this glucose and co@@ stero@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of a treatment weighs up the risk of systemic cor@@ tis@@ ation of effects ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , which is heavily dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are expected to expect high elev@@ ations of plasma levels during the simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ onage increases of this H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be more common monitoring of the therapeu@@ tical concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the plasma @-@ concentration of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ yc@@ in and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased in the current form of am@@ inj@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral bi@@ ased mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while in simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ eas@@ ants of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am led to a possible increase in plasma @-@ bars of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one administered together with am@@ bush avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ane@@ ously symptoms , especially if also low doses can be administered by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the ultra low reliability of historical comparisons , there can be no recommendation given at the same time as the am@@ bush avi@@ r@@ - dose must be adjusted at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive is not predic@@ tible ; therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended .
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the potential risk for the mother compared to the potential risks to the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk activated rats has been proven am@@ bush avi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of di@@ eting rats that was administered by the penetration in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ dur@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight in the after@@ no@@ bility .
the further development of follow @-@ up including fer@@ til@@ ity and reproduction capacity was not imp@@ aired by the administration of am@@ dur@@ avi@@ r to the dam@@ tier .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , occurred early on and rarely resulted in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously on HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the atro@@ cious disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the above side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ eas@@ ants , patients received 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degree 2 to 4 ) , which were tested by the examination than in connection with the study drug , and in more than 1 % of the patients were performed as well as under the treatment deadlines ( degree 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and high @-@ fat fatty tissue , hypertension , hyper@@ trop@@ hies of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ aler fat collection . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ active persons , who were treated with am@@ bush avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine over a medium duration of 36 weeks , was just a case ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 the patients were treated at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ ME ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with different N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) .

&quot; cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term waste of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an inflammatory reaction to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections can develop ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg A@@ gener@@ ase received twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ ped spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( de@@ grade 3 and 4 ) , the type and frequency of side effects ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( degree 2 to 4 ) and CP@@ K values , which were found in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ase , along with low do@@ si@@ fied Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r is located in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells .
the connection between the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the inhibit@@ or of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication of the human being is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ active patients with the currently approved fossil spec@@ avi@@ r / k@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , such as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ not@@ ables - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns can be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for the analysis of the results of resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; on Phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance , phen@@ otype vali@@ dated phen@@ otype systems can be applied in combination with the genital data for the assessment of the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; firms which are diagnostic tests , have been clin@@ ically developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otype cut @-@ offs ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ o@@ avi@@ r associate genetic sample creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ dar@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data on crus@@ resistance between am@@ bush avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ bled avi@@ r , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ active patients , in which a fossil spec@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , In@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , i@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , qu@@ ir@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , i@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) , acc@@ ol@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isol@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early release of a tran@@ sit@@ ing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits that can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ osi@@ dan@@ alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , predominantly with lowest vin@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and three @-@ three hundred ( n = 163 ) patients with a proven virus sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ase , at least another PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superiority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ rati@@ fication of the output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ al last ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks fixed at a non @-@ under@@ dog shaft of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ f@@ oo@@ ed A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which they were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in studies , A@@ gener@@ ase solution became a solution and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it was not given a low dose of chi@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of the patients treated with PI previously had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s together with A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output value . &quot;
19 basics of this data should be considered in consideration when therapy with PI @-@ treated children who are considered to be expected to be considered to be considered to be anticipated .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) to the maximum capacity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with am@@ bush avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % discount of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of am@@ bled avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore the minimum concentration in the ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of the scale and the rate of Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg for a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be attached to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ brid@@ led penetration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of ingredient in plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active share , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ all@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the do@@ atisation process in the ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhibit@@ ory or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , will be given to caution when simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ bush avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; am@@ bush avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ feet than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , hence the effect of a kidney dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ons comparable to those that are obtained from healthy pro@@ ban@@ den after a dose of 1200 mg am@@ bled avi@@ r twice daily with no simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on the can@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bled avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular v@@ ables on humans , which spoke to the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mo@@ ck ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ bled avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the birth of hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular mili@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data to humans , from clinical studies as well as from the therapeutic application , however , there are little indications for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity test , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included in human peri@@ ph@@ s lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes included , am@@ algam was neither mut@@ an@@ age nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
these liver toxicity can be monitored and detected in the clinical everyday life by measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far in clinical studies there has been no significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during the administration of A@@ gener@@ ase or after the end of the treatment . &quot;
studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles were treated as early as 4 days in the review and in the animals treated with am@@ bled animals .
&quot; a systemic Plas@@ ma@@ exposure , which was significantly below ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure among therapeutic doses , however , were observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and insignificant skel@@ etal changes that point to a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ zur@@ es / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ zur@@ es which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be carried out with caution when patients with smar@@ ter or easier liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or vital side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced in length 27 when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ stream@@ line was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ bush avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ bush avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min &apos;s values of am@@ bled avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg li@@ on@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg spro@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; a d@@ osing intake for the simultaneous administration of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ etra can not be given , however , it is recommended a eng@@ masch@@ ige surveillance as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ ence in combination with am@@ bled avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be low .
&quot; when these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring is to be made as an exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ bled avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , will come to a reduction of dosage from Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium det@@ achments such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Nic@@ ot@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , Ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pin , N@@ os@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by am@@ bush , eliminating the activity and toxicity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days of pro@@ stitutes , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose by approximately 86 % ann@@ ank ( 90 % con@@ fi@@ den@@ z@@ interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia , with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a de@@ preci@@ ation or strengthening of the anti @-@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.@@ 0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the potential risk for the mother in comparison with the potential risks to fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study of di@@ eting rats that was administered by the penetration in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ dur@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the body weight in the after@@ no@@ bility .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , are necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % hem@@ m@@ concentrations ( IC@@ 50 ) of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm in acute cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the treatment optimisation should be considered during treatment optimisation with PI @-@ treated children who are expected to be considered to be anticipated . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ all@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of the free active component during the do@@ atisation process in the ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs , which indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or inhibit@@ ory or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , will be given to caution when simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore the effect of a kidney dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
in long @-@ term studies on edge @-@ per@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ bled avi@@ r on mice and rats occurred in male animals en@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ ell@@ ular aden@@ ome in doses made to the 2.@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg am@@ bled avi@@ r .
the underlying mechanism for the birth of the hep@@ at@@ mos@@ pher@@ es of aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ oma was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for the human being is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present ex@@ posi@@ tional data to humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic application , however , little evidence for the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity test , the bacterial re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , micro @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , micro@@ sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ test of human peri@@ ph@@ s lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ algam neither mut@@ an@@ age nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
studies on toxicity in juven@@ iles were treated as early as 4 days in the review and in the animals treated with am@@ bled animals .
&quot; these results can be concluded that in young , the met@@ alli@@ zation passages are not yet fully mature , so am@@ bush avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefits of su@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take place was neither treated with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ bled avi@@ r as a solution to take @-@ take is 14 % less than from am@@ bush avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with the intake of the solution to take ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution amounts to 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg Am@@ Spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dos@@ o recommendations can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase solution to one and low do@@ si@@ gh Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patients may be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col is A@@ gener@@ ase solution to take in small children and children under 4 years , with pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive edge of the met@@ alli@@ zation of these drugs and may cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening adverse side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the present anti @-@ retro@@ viral therapy including the treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of 47 a transfer of HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or vital side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the substance concentration . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced in duration if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of a li@@ pod@@ stream@@ line was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug medium 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in lam@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , the reports were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , reports on an increase of blood vessels including spontaneous cut@@ ters and hem@@ ost@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in caused a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by am@@ bush avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increased , for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ bush avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric and with PD@@ E@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in conjunction of side @-@ effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors are expected to be significantly higher Plas@@ ma@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly higher Plas@@ ma@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am .
the potential risk for man is not known as an aging solution for man may not be applied because of possible toxic reactions of fet@@ us on the pro@@ ven@@ e prop@@ ylene gly@@ col in pregnancy ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk activated rats has been proven am@@ bush avi@@ r @-@ related substances , but it is not known whether am@@ pl@@ avi@@ r passes into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of di@@ eting rats that was administered by the penetration in the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period am@@ dur@@ avi@@ r showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 55 post@@ weight in the after@@ no@@ bility .
the im@@ memorial of A@@ gener@@ ase was investigated in adults and children aged 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether in connection with the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase or another simultaneously on HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the atro@@ cious disease . &quot;

&quot; the applic@@ ator and duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the condition to be treated in the genital area Al@@ dara for up to a maximum of 16 weeks per week . • For small Bas@@ al cell cycles , it is used during one or two four @-@ week treatment cycles , with four weeks pause between the cycles of cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
the cream is scrat@@ ched in front of the bed@@ time di@@ pped on the affected skin surfaces so they left enough for long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed off .
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with placebo ( the same cream but without the substance ) compared . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
&quot; the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete absorption of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dara was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small Bas@@ al cell cancers in two studies , where patients were treated six weeks or five times a week or five times weekly . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the number of patients with complete absorption of tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies on a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than placebo . • In case of treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the complete failure rate in all four major studies was taken from 66 % to 80 % with the patients treated with al@@ dara treated patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clinical , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic acid , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immun@@ o@@ cular adults , if the size or the number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy , and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less appropriate . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time , and 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long as to continue until all the visible anten@@ nas in the genital or peripher@@ y are disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
a interruption in the above @-@ described treatment should be weigh@@ ed if intense local inflamm@@ ations occur ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) or if in the treatment area an infection is observed .
&quot; if at the follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the lesi@@ ons of the lesi@@ ons were only incomplete , a different therapy should be started ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was left out , the patient should carry the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;

&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was conducted , two cases of severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is were observed and a case with one of the circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ ps were observed . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is an increased risk of heavy local skin irritation ( see Section 4.2 ) In rare cases , there were heavy local skin irritation , which made a treatment required and / or resulted in a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty in the water supply , which necessary an emergency ca@@ the@@ ter@@ ization and a treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous measures imposed on genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripher@@ al , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data indicate an increased rate of rate reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lesser effectiveness in this group of patients with regard to the removal of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the Bas@@ al cell cardi@@ ac with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not investigated . &quot;
local skin transactions are common but the intensity of this reaction takes place in general during therapy or the reactions form after conclusion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of local skin transactions , a treatment break can be made from several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin around 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data available on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , there should be subject to other suitable therapeutic forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not lie a clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in previously @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for the treatment of infectious ker@@ at@@ ants inside the nose or ears or on the lip area inside the lip room .
&quot; there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , for the treatment of sac@@ redness to anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and the scal@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the data available on the acute ker@@ at@@ osis on the under@@ poor and hands do not support the effectiveness in this application , as such , such application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin transactions often appear on but these reactions normally take over the course of therapy to intensity or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if the local skin transactions are causing great discomfort or very strong , treatment for a few days may be exposed . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ F lesi@@ ons reported a lesser full healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ o@@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embryonic / federal development , the binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ time nor after multi @-@ recurring application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved , no recommendation to use during the lac@@ tation period can be given . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for the enzymes treatment in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ lack ) in order to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not associated with brain or nerves ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ ch@@ ic@@ ans , g@@ ags ) will not be built and thus in most organs in the body accum@@ ulate and this s@@ hab@@ by . &quot;
&quot; following not neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements difficult , dimin@@ ished lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic disorders .
&quot; administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ traction devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study was mainly examined the safety of drug , but it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect with regards to reducing the G@@ ag concentration in urine and with regard to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms weigh the G@@ ag concentration in urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal big liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nausea , stomach ache , ar@@ thro@@ ats , pain @-@ pain , pain , pain , and reactions in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion point . &quot;
&quot; very frequent side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the pul@@ mon@@ ary function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients , who may be highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) , not to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the European Drug Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be able to check all new information that may possibly be known , check and update this summary if required . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will receive patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms , with regard to the reactions to in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; June 2003 , the European Commission granted the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. approved the approval of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms across the European Union . &quot;
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , Ei@@ ck@@ ock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is inde@@ xed for the long @-@ term enzyme treatment in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ lack ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient carries this , every 15 minutes in single steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and this patient cannot be recommended for this patient .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and for these patients cannot be recommended not a dosage scheme .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , patients can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion stage ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , specifically these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in an appropriate clinical environment , in the rehabilitation centres for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected to be nearly all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from the beginning of treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; given little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , needs to be cautious due to the theoretical risk of superiority after a interruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the beginning of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to minimize the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of a slight or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weigh@@ ed and / or reducing the in@@ fusion rate at half of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be hal@@ ted until the symptoms are brought to decline , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate at which the reaction occurred to be resum@@ ed .
3 ( Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in the in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate occurred in which the prescribed reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular absorption of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not let direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns who were expon@@ entially from Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , while the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is not to be breastfeeding . &quot;
side effects in clinical trials have been largely defined as in@@ fusion conditional reactions which at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years of age ( treatment duration of up to 1 year ) were observed .
&quot; unwanted drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during the Phase 3@@ - study and its extension for a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older in a treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table according to the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre @-@ history , there appeared severe reactions , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ ation and facial oils ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children &apos;s desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a Ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under the age of 5 , with mainly severe distor@@ ting form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , during the period of 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ pent@@ ine version , it occurred among patients aged under the age of 5 ( on the average after 26 days with patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients were not able to det@@ ectable antibodies ( R@@ IP ) As@@ say demonstr@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients with which it never came to ser@@ otonin . &quot;
patients with lack of low @-@ scale anti@@ body resistant to a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies a variable reduction in G@@ ag was as@@ certain@@ ed in the har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ale until low @-@ neutral inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to imp@@ air the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug interactions even if the appearance of unwanted drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reasoning for the enzymes is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzymes .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken from circulation and cells into Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ orous recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled phase 3 @-@ 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to the study , the total disease spectrum was reported , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient referred to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited when they had a for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the anticipated FE@@ V and the absolute o@@ bedience in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - hearing test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label survey where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated to the placebo group , improving the pul@@ mon@@ ary function and sal@@ vi@@ ability , presented in the table below . &quot;
an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table . &quot;
the acceptance of the expected percentage of the FE@@ V is not significant over this period clin@@ ically significant and the absolute lung volume is increasing proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from 26 patients with a hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study , a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was fixed , which remained constant until the degree of study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ geneous illness of the patient , which was taken into account by using a combined final point , the clin@@ ically significant changes at the end of 6 patients ( 58 % ) , is generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year @-@ old open phase @-@ 2 study conducted in which mainly the safety and pharmaceutical genetics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was investigated at 20 patients who were under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with heavy distor@@ ting form and 4 with the mid @-@ run form ) .
four patients were raised the dosage due to increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight loss ( n = 3 ) was determined after the Z @-@ Score for these age group , a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe contrac@@ tion of severe or even no progress in cognitive development were determined . &quot;
&quot; in a phase @-@ 4 study investigations have been conducted for phar@@ yn@@ ge@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ atisation schem@@ ata at the G@@ ag mirror in Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute sessions . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent in patients who have difficulties with weekly versions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ atisation schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug is updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic profile at patients aged under 5 was similar to that in older and less affected patients .

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is applied together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients , which has not extended any chemotherapy ( drugs against cancer ) , and mal@@ ignant cancer ( drugs against cancer ) may have already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ small &quot; lung cancer , which is not assimil@@ ated by SC@@ R cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is treated with patients who had not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chemotherapy regim@@ en than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take in treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) and injections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with Cis@@ pl@@ atin , should be given before or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin in addition a &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic &quot; ( drugs against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a liquid lack ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood @-@ screen changes or at which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be reduced , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , including the formation of DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells divide . &quot;
the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form is easier to equi@@ p in cancer cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentrations of the active form of drug and a longer active duration of cancer cells .
&quot; for the treatment of the mal@@ ignant P@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ v , A@@ lim@@ ta has been studied in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients , which previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small lung cancer the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study conducted at 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy regim@@ en ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) and both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , survived an average of 12,@@ 1 months , compared with 9,@@ 3 months during the sole administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival period with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.@@ 3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which cancer are not attacked by major epitheli@@ um cells , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival rates than with a comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission granted the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. approved the approval of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
every flow bottle must be applied with 4.@@ 2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a solution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary do@@ - sis is extracted and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.@@ 6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is displayed in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin on first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al epitheli@@ al ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is displayed for treatment in the second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al epitheli@@ al ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion at the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cardi@@ ac disease , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of bon@@ net transactions , on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid , and intake must be continued during the entire therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also obtain an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ecting vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 micro@@ grams ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose and after each third Be@@ - manual cycle .
&quot; in case of patients who received P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , a complete blood picture should be created in front of each gift - including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thy@@ ic en@@ umer@@ ation . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in Trans@@ am@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper border value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle there must take place a dosage examination of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood picture or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity of the preceding therapy cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated accordingly to the notes in tables 1 , 2 and 3 which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute &apos;s Common Service C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity 3 degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy needs to be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value before the treatment . &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be abor@@ ted if in patients after 2 tin reductions or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity grade 3 or 4 or so@@ - continue at the occurrence of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 Yahweh or in comparison to patients at the age of 65 is an increased risk @-@ effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to non @-@ sufficient data for in@@ sensitivity and effectiveness .
clinical trials were necessary in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min no dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations necessary to go beyond the dosage recommended for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ ations .
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functionality of &gt; 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - limit value and / or trans@@ am@@ in@@ as@@ en@@ ame of &gt; 5.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper border ( in presence of liver metastatic bats ) were not specifically examined in studies . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the garlic mar@@ sh and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ inde@@ xed must not be administered in patients before their absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ist@@ les has again a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the Th@@ ro@@ ism number reaches a value of more than 100.000 cells / mm ³ .
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ phil@@ en@@ number , thes@@ es and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological toxicity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was desp@@ ised when a pre @-@ line treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients must be dependent on P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction of toxicity @-@ related toxicity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium @-@ free in@@ suffici@@ ency ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ ca@@ isti@@ ka ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed is intended , the intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long semi @-@ value for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including el@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation accumulation in the trans@@ ell@@ ular room , a dra@@ inage of the erg@@ ell@@ ular treatment should be weigh@@ ed before the stimul@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ kt , and zer@@ rov@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events have been reported in clinical trials with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic active substance . &quot;
for this reason the simultaneous application atten@@ u@@ ded vital substances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of a irreversible damage caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out before the treatment - g@@ inn should be advised to obtain advice in terms of locking . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can result non @-@ stero@@ idal anti @-@ stero@@ ids ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1,3 g per day ) to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ inde@@ xed sli@@ ce with the result of a growing appearance of side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ lic acid can be applied in high doses . &quot;
I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - TE@@ NS 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data regarding the interaction potential is available with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long semi @-@ value such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ycle , the simultaneous application must be avoided for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - had been avoided . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the bar@@ ge status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ cer .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as for an@@ de@@ - An@@ tim@@ ari@@ ol@@ ites are expected to be used in pregnancy heavy birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ inde@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except when absolutely replacement for the mother and the risk for the mother and the risk of the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of a irreversible damage caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ inde@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the locking . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ inde@@ xed into the mother &apos;s milk , and unwanted effects in the ges@@ tive infants cannot be ruled out . &quot;

&quot; in the study with All@@ i , in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients of relevant weight loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are o@@ cular stain@@ s at after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with Stu@@ h@@ ens , Stu@@ h@@ ld@@ ring , fet@@ ching / o@@ cular sec@@ tari@@ ffs ( waste ) , Flat@@ ul@@ enz ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it may not be applied in patients who are treated with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent the organ rep@@ airing with transplan@@ ts ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent cl@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absor@@ bing syndrome ( in which not enough nutrients are absorbed from the digestive tract ) or at chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver illness ) , and in pregnant or in nursing mothers . &quot;
July 2007 the European Commission announced the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited licence for the transaction of Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union .
alli is inde@@ xed to the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ cal , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
alli may not be used by children and young people under 18 because there is not enough data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; since Or@@ list@@ at is only minimal absorbed , in older and in patients with reduced liver and / or ren@@ al function , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary . &quot;
• Over@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or one of the other components • simultaneous treatment with Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see Section 4.5 ) • Chron@@ ology painting absor@@ bing period ( see Section 4.6 ) • simultaneous treatment with war@@ ring or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence gast@@ ro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ fat meal or obes@@ e diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be associated with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes , before beginning a therapy with alli made a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs must be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli , as well as medicines for hypertension or have increased cholesterol levels , should consult their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage is to be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ating points , in order to prevent additional fluctu@@ ating measures in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea possible distor@@ tion of the oral contrac@@ eption ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions between drugs and in several cases with simultaneous application of or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a waste of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in @-@ plas@@ m@@ asp@@ es .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ an@@ cia in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ values ( internationally normal , rati@@ o , IN@@ R ) may be influenced ( see Section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients were treated with Or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene in the standard area . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be recommended before bed@@ time a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ itamin supplement to ensure sufficient vitamins ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a mal@@ dose Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time received Or@@ list@@ at , a slight decrease of the Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly gast@@ ro@@ intestinal nature and hang together with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , since the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
most gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( frequency 1 / 10 ) , not known ( frequency based on the data available ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of the known side effects which were found after the launch of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of in@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with alli can lead to conver@@ sions with regard to possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ intestinal side effects .
individual d@@ oses of 800 mg of Or@@ list@@ at and multi@@ disciplinary of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered over a period of 15 days to norm@@ ative and overweight pro@@ ban@@ den without significant clinical findings occurred .
&quot; in majority of the cases reported after the launch of the market launch , either side effects or similar side @-@ effects were reported as in the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals can be attributed by a fast re@@ formation of systemic effects , which can be attributed to li@@ tigation properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect continues in the lum@@ ens of the stomach and the upper thin @-@ intest@@ ine through kov@@ al@@ ente to the active ser@@ in @-@ rest of ga@@ str@@ al and pan@@ demic li@@ pas@@ sions .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food intake . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled trials in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 occupy the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ cal , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameters , the modification of the body weight against the starting point ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those studies that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed for over 12 months , the largest weight loss in the first 6 months has been observed . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.2 % ( output value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change of the L@@ DL cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( output value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( output value 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at the Ta@@ ill@@ ary period , the average change -@@ 4.5 cm with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( output value 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3.@@ 6 cm ( output value 10@@ 3,5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma @-@ concentration of non @-@ metabolic Or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral gift of 360 mg Or@@ list@@ at not measurable ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , in therapeu@@ tical dos@@ ages , not yet metabo@@ li@@ zed oral list@@ ings in plasma was only spor@@ adic@@ ally and in extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0.@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;

alli serves the weight reduction and is used in overweight adults over the age of 18 with a Body Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 28 or over it . alli should be used in conjunction with a fat and low @-@ cal@@ orie diet .
&quot; the BM@@ I helps you determine if you have a normal weight in relation to your body size , or overweight or overweight . &quot;
&quot; even if these diseases first do not cause you to feel uncomfortable , you should nonetheless ask your doctor for check@@ examination . &quot;
&quot; for each 2 kg body weight which you take within a diet , you can lose an additional kilo@@ gram using alli . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken care of even if it is not prescription drugs .

&quot; as you can set up your cal@@ ender and fet@@ ching borders , you will find out more information on the blue pages in Section 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you leave a meal or contains a meal no fat , do not take a capsule . alli can only work when the food contains fat . &quot;
&quot; if you take the capsule in conjunction with a meal , which contains too much fat , risk @-@ conditioned companion ad ( see Section 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; to get used to your body to new eating habits , you begin already before the first capsule with a cold and fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; nutritional di@@ aries are effective since you can comprehend how much you eat , how much you eat and it will likely be easier to change your dietary habits . &quot;
&quot; to achieve your target weight safely , you should set up two daily goals in advance : one for the calories and one for fat . &quot;
&quot; nour@@ ish you fatty fet@@ ched , in order to decrease the probability for nutritional needs ( see Section 4 ) . • Tr@@ y to move more before you start taking the capsules . &quot;
remember your doctor in advance if you are not used physical activity . • St@@ ay you during taking and also after the intake of alli physically active .
&quot; • alli may not be taken longer than 6 months . • If you can notice after twelve weeks use of alli no reduction of your weight , please ask your doctor or pharmac@@ ist for advice . &quot;
&quot; under certain circumstances you need to end the intake of alli . • In a successful weight loss , it is not about setting the diet and then return to the old habits . &quot;
&quot; if less than an hour has passed since the last meal , take the intake of the capsule . • If more than one hour has passed since the last meal , do not take a capsule . &quot;

&quot; the most common side effects are combined with the effect of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body . &quot;
these side @-@ effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment starts since you have not significantly reduced the fatty acids in the diet .
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional effects : • Beg@@ inning you already a few days , or better one week , prior to the initial intake of your favorite meals and about the size of the portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the probability that you can exceed your fat limit . • Share your recommended li@@ ft@@ amount even@@ ly on daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ fat main thing or a fine post@@ ure , as you may have done it with other programs for weight reduction . • The most people in those accompanying them may learn to control these with the time through adaptation of their diets . &quot;

&quot; energy is also measured in kilo@@ gram@@ ou@@ le , which you also find as an indication of the packaging of food . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake , how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
&quot; note the tables below in this section below . • The recommended fet@@ ching intake in gram is the maximum amount of fat , which you should take with every meal . &quot;
&quot; which amount for you is suitable , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories you are suitable for you . • Due to the operation of the capsule is the adherence to the recommended scr@@ apes . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; due to the recommended fet@@ ters , you can maximize the weight of weight and at the same time dimin@@ ishing the probability for nutritional effects . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
&quot; 34 This reduced cal@@ orie intake should enable you to lose weight gradually and continuously , approximately 0.5 kg per week in weight without any frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; low physical activity &quot; means that you &apos;re eating daily only little or even not walk , e.g. through 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute garden work or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; for a permanent weight reduction , it is necessary to set out realistic cal@@ ori@@ - and fat targets and also adhere to it . • Re@@ qui@@ eting is a nutritional textbook with information about the cal@@ ori@@ - and fat content of your meals . • Tr@@ y to move more before starting with the intake of alli . &quot;
&quot; the alli programme to support the weight reduction combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials , which can help you to feed cal@@ ori@@ - and fet@@ ching gear and give guidelines to become physically active . &quot;
&quot; in conjunction with one on your type of cro@@ pped program to support weight loss , you can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chemotherapy to break the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as chemotherapy ( such as Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi may be increased by the additional gift of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tic ) .
the application in patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as to the effects in this age group does not exist enough information .
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents the bond of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ tam@@ in ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies at 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chemotherapy regim@@ en received , which are strong or moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting are , 59 % of the patients who treated with Alo@@ xi were treated with alo@@ xi ( 132 from 2@@ 23 ) , over 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron &apos;s treated patients ( 126 by 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chemotherapy that are moderate trig@@ gering for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients were treated with alo@@ xi , in 24 hours following chemotherapy no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients with On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron treated patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values in 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
&quot; March 2005 , the European Commission announced the Helsinki @-@ Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . the approval for the in@@ filtration of Alo@@ xi throughout the European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is indic@@ ative : to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting at highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to a cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting that induc@@ es through a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be ampli@@ fied by adding a co@@ stero@@ ids in front of chemotherapy .
da Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of sub @-@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection . &quot;
&quot; like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , however , caution is advisable at the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic medicines which extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T interval is extended or which tend to extend such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemotherapy treatment , Alo@@ xi is to be used neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies inhi@@ bited pal@@ on@@ otic medicines , which were not examined for tum@@ ors , and not ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ ates , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ yc@@ in C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ otic and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ uses , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population @-@ based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous Gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ( Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ elec@@ tr@@ ine , Hal@@ ic@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ ine , chor@@ ine , ser@@ ox@@ etine , ser@@ ox@@ etine , ser@@ ox@@ etine , Ser@@ tr@@ ine , and Ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ otic . &quot;
&quot; experience for the use of Pal@@ on@@ otic ® in human pregn@@ ancies do not lie ahead , therefore Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron should not be applied at pregnant women , unless it is considered by the treating doctor as necessary . &quot;
clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams to observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) which at least were related to Alo@@ xi related to headaches ( 9 % ) and shelter ( 5 % ) .
&quot; rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of over@@ sensitivity and reactions at the destination of the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were given in post @-@ marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies showed itself similar to undes@@ irable events as in the other do@@ atisation groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relations . &quot;
&quot; there were no di@@ aly@@ sis studies performed , due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably does not have effective therapy in a alo@@ xi@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies were given a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ ak@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 7.@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients , which received a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ zin and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ tron , as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron , with patients compared to 32 mg On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with moder@@ ately chemotherapy and the study with heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy is summar@@ ized in the following tables .
in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on comparable . &quot;
&quot; according to the references pre @-@ clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the iter@@ ations involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and prec@@ pol@@ arization and extend the duration of action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out at 221 healthy pro@@ ban@@ den study was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ effects of i.@@ BC in individual d@@ oses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous Gift , follows an initiate elimination of the plasma @-@ concentration of a slow Eli@@ min@@ ation from the body with an average time period of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the entire Dos@@ age range from 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ / kg in gest@@ ures and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous Gift from Pal@@ on@@ otic P@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , between day 1 and day 5 measured average ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ otic Plas@@ ma@@ Con@@ centr@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations it highlights that at once daily intraven@@ ous acts of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ otic ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) reached the overall value in 3 consecutive days ; however , the C@@ max after the announcement of 0,@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
around 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and approximately another 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ alli@@ ons that have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect at 5@@ HT@@ 3 recipes .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies on met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ min@@ ation After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ otic tron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic as imm@@ utable substance , made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous pins for gest@@ ures , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver dysfunction , the termin@@ ale elim@@ inations time and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron increases , however , reducing the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical trials , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions which can be considered adequate above the maximum human@@ therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 From the clinical studies there are indications that Pal@@ on@@ otic can only be block in very high concentrations of iter@@ ations , which are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and pol@@ pol@@ arization and can extend the service potential for action . &quot;
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ otic ( each dose correspon@@ ded in about the 30@@ 1 of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increasing frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ tics ( in thy@@ roid , pitu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , spinal cord ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi is determined for the unique application , the relevance of these results will be neg@@ atively evaluated for the human being . &quot;

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative credit , in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C has been recommended for the treatment of hepatitis C in 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon should resem@@ ble a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same pharmac@@ ist effective component , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference phar@@ ma &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long prolonged ) hepatitis C ( a viral infection caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; at a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination , the liver tissue damages points out , in addition are the values of the liver enzymes Alan@@ in @-@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to the formation of the ingredient .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon placed data that occupy the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , function , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured how many patients were treated after 12 of a total of 48 patients , as well as 6 months after hiring the treatment to the drug ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressed in the case that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug could not be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
&quot; after hiring the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease in more patients had more than with the reference cure ; Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , in the study , the test for examining the question , to what extent the drug is an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be applied to the treatment of im@@ peti@@ tions ( one with cruci@@ fy skin infection ) and small infected la@@ in@@ ants ( R@@ iss@@ - or cutting f@@ aded ) , dis@@ cord and paraly@@ zed wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for treating infections that were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant for@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because al@@ go against these kinds of infections might not affect this type of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface should not be more than 2 % of the surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two or three days , the doctor should investigate the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ gs ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was sealed after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo spoke to the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected Hau@@ tw@@ ine , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : if the results of both studies were assembled at home @-@ time , about 90 % of the patients of both groups were treated to treatment . &quot;
&quot; in these two studies , however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( time @-@ filled hollow rooms in the body tissue ) or of infections that were veri@@ fiable or presumably caused by MR@@ SA is not effective enough . &quot;
the com@@ mon@@ est side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) is an irritation at the order of the order .
&quot; the committee for human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections compared to the risks : • Im@@ peti@@ go , • infected small in@@ ies , dis@@ cord or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; may 2007 , the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for domestic use by Al@@ tar@@ go , in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , in which two to three days do not show improvement , should be examined and considered an alternative therapy ( see Section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of raising awareness or serious local irritation by applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , the treatment is cancelled carefully and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection started . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections , which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gens or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in secondary wounds the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was the effectiveness of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections , caused by a meth@@ acry@@ late for@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after a 2- to 3 @-@ day treatment does not enter an improvement or a deterioration of the infected place . &quot;
the impact of the simultaneous application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plas@@ tic@@ concentrations that were achieved in humans to use topical skin or infected super@@ fici@@ ally wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 after simultaneous gift of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max to topical skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system exposure to topical application in patients , dosage adjustment cannot be considered if topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors will be applied . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity according to oral in@@ ges@@ tion and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the Federal / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy if an topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able in the gift of a systemic antibiotic .
the decision whether the breastfeeding continues / ends or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated between the benefit of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most commonly reported side effect of irritation at the destination , which considered approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is ins@@ ulated by Fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the action mechanism of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhibit@@ or of bacterial prot@@ ein@@ yn@@ thesis by interaction in a particular bin@@ dings of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the Bin@@ dings of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial fabrics .
data point out that the Bin@@ z @-@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ cat@@ erer and of the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ Centre .
through the bond of this bin@@ dings inhibit@@ or inhibit@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , partial P @-@ binary packages and prevent the normal formation of active 50@@ s ri@@ mal@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; in the basis of the local prevalence of resistance , the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should appear at least some infection forms , should be pursued by experts by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in the case of failure to treat S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults became 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and placed on a low skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary wounds , individual plastic wa@@ ver were obtained . &quot;
the sampling took place 3 or 4 among adult patients each before the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual system inclusion at the people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 m ² ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP shirt .

&quot; in studies on oral toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid . &quot;

&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of reduced Fer@@ til@@ isation in oral doses of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , making an up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved as the highest valued exposure to humans ( topical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats were found at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 @-@ times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development sto@@ x@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ological toxicity . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the approval for the controller must ensure that a pharmaceutical system , as described in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application application ( Version 6.@@ 2 ) is available and works before the product is marketed and as long as the product market is applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the approval for the controller has been committed to carry out more detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ o@@ cular activities , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) and in the module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , which will be arranged with CH@@ MP . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases which affect the liver ) with children aged between one and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ sty against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix will be applied as part of one of two doses of existing vaccines and a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix must only be used if the immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the vaccine plan can be brought to an end by two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired can be given Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine .
vaccines work by bringing the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) &quot; how it can defend itself against a disease .
&quot; once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and generates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix has the same ingredients as the vaccine has been approved since 1996 and has been approved since 1997 by Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vaccines are used to protect the same disease , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered up within three doses of existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adult are included ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ rix adults , also as a test@@ ament to the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed one month after the last injection of a protective anti@@ body con@@ centric .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two injections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to a se@@ ap@@ - and at a 12 @-@ month distance between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine ) are head@@ ache , ap@@ peti@@ tions de@@ fici@@ encies , pain in the inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ ur@@ iness ( fatigue ) as well as friction . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix is allowed to react to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) , not to be applied . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the in@@ filtration of Ambi@@ rix in the whole
&quot; the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccines , whereby the first dose is administered by the election and the second dose between six and 12 months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her chim@@ ney is desired for hepatitis A as well as for hepatitis B , it can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines or with a combination . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis C treatment ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) anti@@ body values are in the same size as after the vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet fully backed up if immune @-@ competent persons , who have addressed on a Hepatitis A@@ - vaccination , as they may need a refres@@ ris@@ er as protection since it may be protected even with no longer det@@ ectable antibodies by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
3 As for all inj@@ ectable substances should be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the Gift of the vaccine according to medical treatment and monitoring .
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ zation scheme is recommended with the combination intake , the 360 ELISA units form@@ able hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated Hepatitis B surface . &quot;
&quot; at K@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and persons with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the immune system , after the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ isation , there is no sufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body , so that in these cases the Gift of further vacc@@ inations can be required . &quot;
since an intra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration could result in the scales to become a sub@@ optimal implications of success should these inj@@ ectable paths should be avoided .
&quot; due to Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ top@@ ia or blood @-@ inner distur@@ ban@@ ces , Ambi@@ rix will however be in@@ stituted in a very sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift for bleeding . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second life year in the form of separate inj@@ ector , tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activation Poli@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis@@ - and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ ern@@ - m@@ umps and vaccine vaccine administered was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it has to be assumed that no adequate immun@@ ode@@ ficiency is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 ino@@ x of these formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ch@@ un@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ ache and fever comparable with the frequency that was observed in the former Thi@@ omer@@ cial and preserv@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccines have been administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix had been compared to the 3 @-@ cans combination .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and activity on a calculation basis per ino@@ x , but not on one calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the promot@@ ers observed when compared with 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the promot@@ ers after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination .
&quot; after the complete vaccine cycle reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den who had administered Ambi@@ rix had been vacc@@ inated over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the promot@@ ers who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ age combination . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of matri@@ xes however was comparable to per strap ( i.e. about the entire vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the pro@@ ban@@ den , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared with 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % in the promot@@ ers who received the 3 @-@ cans console ) . &quot;
the incidence of reck@@ oned pain and activity was small and comparable to that was observed after filing of the drop @-@ recommended dosage with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ages scheme .
in a comparative study of 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vaccines the appearance of local reactions and general reactions in the ambient group was comparable to that which was observed in administration with the 3 @-@ doses of form@@ able hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface .
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - olds , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix was a common occurrence of pain ( at the inj@@ ector ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band . &quot;
the proportion of vacc@@ inations which reported via severe side effects during the 2 @-@ hour vaccine schem@@ as with Ambi@@ rix or 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis C surface and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis @-@ B@@ - surface an@@ tigen was statisti@@ cally different .
&quot; in clinical studies conducted at the age of 1 to including 15 years , Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % had a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two cans Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combination with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 2@@ 89 persons whose immun@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was worth@@ less , the ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ary rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 @-@ Dos@@ en@@ sus is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which was achieved in a clinical comparison study from 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ year after completion of the full vaccine series ( i.e. , in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dos@@ ages scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dos@@ ages scheme with a combination of 360 ELISA units form@@ able hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface .
people who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ners between 12 and 15 years old could be proven the consistency of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccines .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to that which after vaccination of 3 cans with a combination intake consisting of 360 ELISA units form@@ alized Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - until including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies are compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccines .

&quot; hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transferred by other ways such as bathing in the water @-@ contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow searches ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix not completely protect against an infection with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis B virus even if the full vaccines have been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are infected before the administration of both vaccine function@@ rix which are infected with hepatitis @-@ A@@ - or hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick / feel ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; a protection against other infections , which are the liver pe@@ ars or symptoms , which are similar to those according to a hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection can not be conve@@ yed . &quot;
• If you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves through ju@@ ck@@ wise ras@@ hes ; breathing or swelling of the face or tongue . • when with you / your child already occurred an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever .
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and in the usually intended administration of the second vaccine ) .
at a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced salary of effective components per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis B @-@ B surface ) .
&quot; the second vaccine dose of this vaccine with reduced salary of effective components is usually administered a month after the first dose , and may give you a vaccine against end of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals suffering from severe blood @-@ inner distur@@ ban@@ ces , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weak@@ ened due to a disease or treatment in your / his body &apos;s defense / or if you / your child will undergo a tick @-@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases but the immune response of these individuals on the vaccination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to vaccination is .
21 Sa@@ gen you to your doctor if you / your child may take further medicines / takes ( including those that you have received without prescription / or if you / your child have recently been vacc@@ inated / has been given or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ine ( antibodies ) have to be given / or this is planned in the near future .
but it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses .
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as diverse as possible . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix is administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins it is likely that reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient .
&quot; usually , ambient or nursing women is not administered , except it is urgent to be vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ yc@@ in ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
it is very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ imal dos@@ ages ) : • For pain or discomfort on the inser@@ tion or redness • Mat@@ te • headaches • appetite defects
how often ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ imal dos@@ ages ) : • swelling at the injection time • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Ben@@ id@@ ation • gast@@ ro@@ intestinal disorders
&quot; further side @-@ effects , which were reported days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination - or single @-@ im@@ p agents against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 dec@@ imal doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include local or extensive envel@@ opes , the it@@ ching can be or blows @-@ shaped , swelling of the eye @-@ part and the face , difficult blood pressure , or hat@@ ching , sudden blood pressure and consci@@ ous@@ y . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages for 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in pack@@ ets to 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data , which has been well known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for domestic purposes , the CH@@ MP agreed that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix has been linked to traffic only in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with intimate En@@ z@@ ymers or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ al En@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ mon@@ ium concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
am@@ mon@@ k is divided into several individual d@@ ots to the meals - swal@@ lowed by the food or via a guest @-@ stom@@ ach@@ l@@ or ( through the abdom@@ en in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a no@@ zzle ( through the nose in the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with another treatment or with placebo ( a search@@ drug medicine , i.e. without any substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also cause loss of acid in blood , depression , stimul@@ ability , head@@ ache , headaches , ob@@ struction , hydr@@ ation , sickness or taste , skin irritation , skin rash , in@@ tolerant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Human@@ cology ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that am@@ mon@@ aps were effective in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ium levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the condition at the time the authorisation is only limited information about this medicine . &quot;
the use is indic@@ ative of all patients where a complete En@@ z@@ ymers has already manifested in the New @-@ born old ( within the first 28 life days ) .
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ fic@@ al form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective who manifes@@ ts itself after the first life of the month ) then there is an indication for use if in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ mon@@ olith@@ ic En@@ cephal@@ opathy .
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with lo@@ fty disorders is AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
&quot; the daily dose is individually calculated with regard to protein intolerance , and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients suffering from an early @-@ mani@@ x@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ otic bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0,@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered for patients with lo@@ op@@ ha@@ y , as a risk for the emergence of eco @-@ ho@@ gan@@ us@@ ul@@ cer@@ a consists of if the tablets cannot enter the stomach immediately . &quot;
&quot; every tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , accordingly to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium poly@@ cen@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe kidney failure as well as with sodium and eco @-@ sensitive clinical conditions .
&quot; because met@@ alli@@ zation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is carried out via the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results regarding pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and a prolonged loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
it also found a delayed mat@@ uring of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be established whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left at the human &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period is contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS stood at 56 % of the patients at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of these undes@@ irable developments were reported that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic disease in combination with Lak@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ kal@@ ia , peripher@@ y of neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of over@@ dose occurred during a 5 month old small child with an accidental sing@@ dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed in a intraven@@ ous administration of cans up to 400 mg / kg / day a dos@@ is@@ hable neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic connection that caused by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is left over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative support for elimination of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary Cycle can be presum@@ ed that for each gram em@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; it is important that diagnosis is at an early stage , and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical results . &quot;
the prognosis of the premature @-@ mani@@ um form of the condition with appearance of the first symptoms in the newborn old was almost always inf@@ ant and the disease caused even when treating a per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking free an@@ alo@@ ga within the first year of life .
&quot; by hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen frame ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , sodium and potentially substitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns at post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first month of life ) diagnosed with 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in pregnancy and which were already treated before the first appearance of a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ mic encephal@@ opathy , the survival rates was 100 % , but even with these patients it came from time with many to intellectual disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ um form of the condition ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ got@@ hic form of the or@@ ni@@ an trans@@ car@@ n@@ yl@@ ase defect ) which were treated by a hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ ot@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ous diet was evaluated the over @-@ life rate 98 % .
existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is neg@@ ated in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined by a single dose of 5 g nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with so@@ ber healthy adult and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients following intraven@@ ous use of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral individual dose of 5 g nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in Tab@@ le@@ ten@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
in the majority of patients with ureth@@ ane @-@ cycli@@ c disorders or hem@@ ost@@ glo@@ bin@@ o ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was shown .
&quot; with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three lon@@ d@@ oses ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plas@@ m@@ as@@ per are five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the conditional product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine about the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non toxic cans were treated no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ant and children , which can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with lo@@ bites ) or about a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ tern or a no@@ zzle . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experiences the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as with adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um@@ proteins in plasma should be kept within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients suffering from an early @-@ mani@@ x@@ phosph@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ otic bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg per gram nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , accordingly to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium poly@@ cen@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
if rat feder@@ ate before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active met@@ abo@@ lit by phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) were exposed to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ se .
&quot; a more likely toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old anor@@ mal patient , which developed a metabolic disease in combination with Lak@@ tat@@ too , severe hypo@@ kal@@ ia , peripher@@ y of neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ ometric is comparable to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with distur@@ ban@@ ces of the ur@@ inary Cycle can be assumed that for each gram , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen . &quot;
existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition .
&quot; after an oral individual dose of 5 g nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in Gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after taking measurable plasma @-@ concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can retain the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not above 25 ° C. &quot;
this procedure contains the small measuring spo@@ on 0.@@ 95 g ; the medium measuring spo@@ on 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.5 g Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
if a patient has to get the medication over a probe can AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS before use also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) .
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are absent , so that they accum@@ ulate the sti@@ cking waste products that accum@@ ulate the consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you are conducted with you , you need to tell the doctor that you may take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can affect the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since the medicine could skip to the mother &apos;s milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases also con@@ fu@@ sions , headaches , taste disorders , im@@ itation of ear , dis@@ oriented , memory distur@@ ban@@ ces and a deterioration of existing neurological conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , get in touch immediately with your doctor or with the emergency of your hospital , for the introduction of a corresponding treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood sugar to the heart ) , for example with un@@ stable Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ kt ( an anom@@ al measuring with the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; will An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to the prevention of blood vessels in patients , which is administered of a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with Ang@@ ina or coron@@ ary heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ ot@@ or ( GP@@ I , another medicine to prevent cl@@ ot@@ rot@@ tles ) with conventional combination treatment with ha@@ par@@ ine ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI the patient was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes , which remains in the ar@@ tery to prevent a locking ) , and they received additional medicines to prevent cl@@ ot@@ ics , like Ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without the gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( death cases , coron@@ ary incidents or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year , as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who subjected to a PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as effective as pi@@ et@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was much more effective than pi@@ et@@ in . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other deer or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as in people with severe hypertension or severe kidney problems or dis@@ infection . &quot;
the committee for human@@ ities ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI is a acceptable replacement for pi@@ et@@ in .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission announced the company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd . a permit for domestic use by An@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ es@@ in@@ far@@ ct ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) with an emergency access or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if the patient is carried out a PCI , an additional Bol@@ us should be given by 0,5 mg / kg and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h . &quot;
after the PCI can be resum@@ ed after clinical demand the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours .
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als intraven@@ ous figure of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one directly subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and effectiveness of a certain Bol@@ us @-@ Gift from An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted medicine should be carefully mixed up before the application and the bol@@ us@@ osis dose should be given rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT is worth more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided the 1,@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dosage is administered properly . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney disease ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which is subjected to PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ uti@@ din to ACS or not ) , a lower inflation rate should be used by 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT &apos;s value is 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg is to be administered by 0.@@ 3 mg / kg and the ACT can re@@ consider 5 minutes after the second bolt . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with moderate kidney damage , which was included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which were included in approval was the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without a dosage adjustment for an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see below Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with An@@ gi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous form of in@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous formulation of temporary hegemon@@ y .
• well known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other parts or against deer • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or mis@@ sive sc@@ aling disorders . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding particularly when it is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients under bees the most bleeding in arter@@ ial point points occur , can be subject to patients who undergo a per@@ cut@@ aneous coron@@ ary military intervention ( PCI ) while the treatment is in principle everywhere bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients suffering from war@@ far@@ in and treated with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ uti@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International norm@@ ative rati@@ o ) should be considered to ensure that the value of the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine will once again be achieved before the treatment level . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which need treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdom@@ inal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or administered as continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease in which the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or can not process insulin in effect .
&quot; insulin is quite different from human rights , and the change means that it seems faster and a shorter period of action has a short @-@ effective human@@ eness . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in combination with a slow exercise in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes in which the body cannot produce insulin in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years .
type @-@ 2 diabetes where the body insulin is not effective in which the body was not effective in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the modification of the substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ at@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin per year .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % of human normal standard .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be applied to patients who are potentially hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or one of the other components or in patients who are already suffering from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted when it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood glucose level .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission announced the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Deutschland GmbH for approval by A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is used as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the area of the abdom@@ en or the trunk or the del@@ usion or sub@@ cut@@ aneous through continuous in@@ fusion into the area of abdom@@ inal muscles .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose @-@ ogen@@ esis capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin delivery , the insulin @-@ needs can be down in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of strength , the trademark ( Her@@ b ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , zin@@ k@@ delayed etc . ) , the species of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the method of production can move a change in insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage , or the break@@ age of a treatment , in particular in patients with an ins@@ ulated diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ tic outlet ; these conditions are potentially vital . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or insulin in another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage required .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the effect of the insulin profile , and therefore can change when changing the treatment regim@@ en . &quot;
&quot; among the substances that can increase blood sugar @-@ bearing activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ vities ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , fibro@@ us , flu@@ ox@@ etine , mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ation , s@@ ali@@ zy@@ late and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ iz@@ e@@ ye@@ tika such as Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ eth@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pin the symptoms of the in@@ ep@@ it@@ ated counter @-@ regulation will be shiel@@ ded or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies for reproduction studies showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human , regarding pregnancy , the embryonic / fet@@ al development , the birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin over@@ enters into human mother &apos;s milk , but in general insulin is not reflected in the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;

severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consci@@ enti@@ ousness may be treated by means of an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a given person or treated by intraven@@ ous use of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the urine thing for the severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels due to the stimulation of the peri@@ ph@@ ate glucose absorption ( especially due to skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin delivery in the efficiency occurs faster and the active duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
&quot; in a study with 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , insulin @-@ effects showed a very dis@@ proportionate glucose range , and 0,@@ 3 E / kg or more dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose effect , just like human . &quot;
insulin is twice as fast as normal human@@ ization such as normal human rights and achieves total glucose effect approximately 2 hours earlier than human .
&quot; from the data it was evident that in an application of insulin @-@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved , as with a humane normal , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
