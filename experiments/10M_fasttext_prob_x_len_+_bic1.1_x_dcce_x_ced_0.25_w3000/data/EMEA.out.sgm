<seg id="6">"bilify is applied to the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes and the prevention of manic episodes in patients, which have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is applied to rapid control of gested anxiety or behavioural disorders when the oral ingesting of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be used or the melting pot in patients with loosing of tablets difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in case of patients who are simultaneously taking other medicines, which are just as bilify, the dose should be adapted by Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitter, "i.e. chemical substances that allow communication of nerve cells among each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole mainly affects the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters affects the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder contributes to normalize Aripiprazole to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and its recurrence is prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, the recurrence of symptoms to prevent, has been studied in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of the injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar disorders, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify became more than 12 weeks to 347 patients with semi-operated dol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo that have been stabilized to 160 patients, in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which were linked by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in symptoms of patients by a standard method for bipolar disorder or the number of patients that spoke to treatment were examined."</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also led studies to investigate how the body resorted down the melting pot and the solution to the insertion.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injecting solution showed patients, Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms experienced than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify has decreased in four of the five short-time studies more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify prevented up to 74 weeks more effective than placebo the recurrence of manic episodes in previously treated patients and if it was additionally administered to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Bilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased more effective than placebo the symptoms of gestural unrest and were similar to Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side-effects of Abilify to take (observed from 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapporous disorders (uncontrollability), abrupt (nausea), obstruction (nausea), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness (disgrace), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the committee for humanities (CHMP) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from medium-heavy to serious natural episodes in patients who had predominantly manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes had to outweigh the treatment with Aripiprazole to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the outcome that the advantages of injecting inconsistencies in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar disorder when a oral therapy is not suitable to outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">June 2004 the European Commission announced the Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit for domestic use by Abilify within the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and for preventing a new Ottoman episode in patients indicated predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dosage of 15 mg / day once daily from meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in doses of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients more than 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the greater sensitivity of these patients, a lower initialdose should be considered if clinical factors should be justified (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-inductor is set off from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suilous behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased efficiency risk associated with Aripiprazole compared to other antipsychotic medicines.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be applied with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (Myocardinal or ischaemia, cardiac insufficiency (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with bloodshed medicines) or hypertonia (including aczeleried and malignant form)."</seg>

<seg id="39">"if with ABILIFY treated patients signs and symptoms of a late dymis, should be considered to reduce the dose or prevent the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that will indicate to a mns, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic drugs must be dropped."</seg>

<seg id="47">"gaining weight increases in general in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania, the use of antipsychotic medicines, with which weight gain is known as side-effect and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nerve system, caution is advisable when Aripiprazole is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally effective medicines with themselves superimposed side effects such as sedation (see Section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the resilience of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically not relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy proportions, a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripiprazole by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other high-effective inhibitors from CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should be made similar dosisations."</seg>
<seg id="52">CYP2D6 'bad' (= "poor") metabolites can result the common use with high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4 in higher plasma-concentrations of Aripiprazole compared to CYP2D6 extensive metabolism.</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint gift of Ketoconazol, or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks to the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other high-effective inhibitors from CYP3A4, such as Itraconazol and HIV proteasants, may have similar effects, and therefore similar dosisations should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"according to the CYP2D6- or 3A4-Inhibitors, the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY to the dosage above the beginning of the companion therapy."</seg>

<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for the safety of man and due to the concerns in human production studies, this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justifies clearly the potential risk of foetus."</seg>
