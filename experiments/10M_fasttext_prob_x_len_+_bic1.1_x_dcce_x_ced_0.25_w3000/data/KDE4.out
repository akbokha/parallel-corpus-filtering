&quot; the module Web page can be translated in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ menu under Ex@@ tras website , select the output and target language of the translation . &quot;
&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only part of the whole &amp; URL will be translated . &quot;
&quot; machine translation are only very rudi@@ mentary translation . Baby@@ lon@@ fish produces in the best case a rough translation and in the worst case nonsense . hence , the translations should not be made important , without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
only web pages on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated to the bab@@ el@@ fish @-@ page where you can insert your texts directly .
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains different modules for &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; despite their small size , they offer some additional features and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; by using this easier . &quot;
&quot; for more information about the use of &amp; par@@ quer@@ or , and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual on &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; &quot;
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or , select Settings extensions ... open the car@@ p card tools and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of default modules from the package ; add @-@ ons . please note that perhaps more modules on your system are , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
&quot; you should install the package base , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the Ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; for crash , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module starter filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras . with the module you can filter and con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos; s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to view the DO@@ M &apos;s supervision in the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or , select Ex@@ tras DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the web page . as a default setting , the display starts with the throw @-@ node of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ Type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different tool@@ - and text views so that you can view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the partic@@ ul@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of portra@@ y the folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree map . each object is represented by a rec@@ tan@@ gle , whose surface must be proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size of a file or folder is defined , whereby the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . accordingly , the FS@@ View may be easily detected , as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command &apos;s command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; is an entry in the window display a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which represents a file or folder in your file system . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles meaningful colour and marking settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rec@@ tan@@ gle , which is switched about colour mode , can be either depth for the light detection of the bol@@ dness or the illustration of a different type of file such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rec@@ tan@@ gle can be lab@@ eled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if enough space to be displayed at all , or whether the area of sub@@ ordinate justification can occur ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of cap@@ tion in the rec@@ tan@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; case algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps should normally be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . for the tre@@ ad in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always observed . note that the sub@@ ordinate entries will no longer be available . note that less space is lost for the frame , if the rectangular square is square . &quot;
&quot; as spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation remains left to us . here it is intended for the cap@@ tion and avoidance of space loss by frame always advantageous to al@@ loc@@ ating the areas that are as square . the best methods concerning this are lines , columns or recur@@ sive disorder . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal set of the area for an entry over the menu entry view of the area . instead , a smo@@ ker model is drawn into the surface of the sub@@ ordinate application , to indicate that this area is actually eviden@@ ced by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
originally it was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets designed for the use of K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind .

&quot; an easy to use camera plate is provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , each medium and every card reader is supported by your OS , with &amp; checking ; working together . &quot;
&quot; there came a fast image processing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to review and correct your photos , comment , evaluate and correct . the editing abilities can be easily extended with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it provides cleaning professional skills . it works entirely in 16 @-@ bit color foam and all available modules support the raw conver@@ tion by li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G @-@ Export and ICC Con@@ figuration Management . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg ; via the camera or the lens , which can be looked for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also available &amp; digi@@ tization ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; I came to report the milking of problems or suggestions for them as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu includes an entry issues or requests . all required information is already registered here . follow only the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; he came here ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that the user and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; checking ; however , we would like to answer some other users of &amp; digi@@ tization . in this mailing list , however , we would like to answer some other users . in this mailing list , however , you should be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the website ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; checking ; to learn .
the best start to get involved and checking ; to participate is the registration in the developer mailing list . guide to the log in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ tization came .
&quot; when you run &amp; checking ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder icon , or click the folder symbol to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second box you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data stream is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add so many folder as you would like to add . &amp; checking , you will additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ box set up the collections . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can indicate the top folder , the images contains , as a basic folder . &amp; checking it ; see every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed while you &apos;ll get a step @-@ step forward as this : &quot;
&quot; he came . thir@@ st re@@ cur@@ sively the libr@@ arian libr@@ arian in its entire depth . you can not add sub @-@ folders , unless it list in hiding folder . this lets you add exceptional bs &amp; digi@@ tization ; take a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list are not taking photos as symbols . you can change the photo by using any photo from the album and use it on the folder symbol . further details can be found in the section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; checking ; your digital camera set up . afterwards you should learn how to use My albums and key@@ note lists to ad@@ minister your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw use : in case you use the raw mode of your camera , so it may work . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the menu help raw material support . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections of Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h work@@ flow .
&quot; an easy to use camera plate is provided to you so that you can connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ tization . of course , each medium and every card reader is supported by your OS , with &amp; checking ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterised by using Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera can then be implemented as a disk drive . the camera can also be used via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may be used to connect the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; updates ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ photo@@ 2 is a free , sophisticated software collection for digital cameras , which has developed a continuously increasing number of over 800 cameras . it allows to transfer pictures of digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and broad@@ casts came across the serial port , this connection is now outdated . &amp; checking ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
&quot; li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ ph support , so that EX@@ IF support is needed by some li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers to read the thumb@@ nails . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might recognize thumb@@ nails possibly nothing or the production could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things came about &amp; checking ; is how easy to extend its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is a joint module structure for &amp; checking ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the goal is to provide the modules to all the graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it is considerably easier , &amp; checking ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes made in &amp; digi@@ tization came . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either switch the page with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full @-@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + Shift . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop off images works everywhere : you can take a picture in another part of the tree tree , above the horizontal divi@@ ding line or another application window . the only limitation is that a picture does not take in keywords , file list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file choice allows you to lift the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , filtering on the fil@@ en@@ ame is only displayed when these ind buttons are displayed as well . which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; represents an organized view on your photographic space . all the photos that were saved by &amp; checking , are sorted according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a scre@@ enshot directly to an album . select &quot; &quot; Import &quot; &quot; scre@@ enshot of the album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and then drop it . you can also copy or copy the photo by moving or copying . simply select all photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to provide information about this collection . to access the album features , you need to click on the album button and select the menu template . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are one method to mark your albums , so that you can select or delete your photos by collection of your photos . if you want to add or delete files from your collection , you can add it into the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used if you sort your albums by date with view albums depending on date .
&quot; the buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , new ester : these set the date on the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . in addition , the average of the images from their EX@@ IF data will be used . if this fails , the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first got an album in &amp; checking ; open the first picture in the album as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; chosen . this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative , and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as album icon , you need to click on the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu &amp; quot ; As Alb@@ um@@ bel@@ cher quot ; select . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be wasted .
&quot; publications came ; support the input of key@@ word for individual photos in the main window . album collections have another effect . on the collection include all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the window window will provide you with the main view of your photos . when you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the window window . each photo will be displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of these curtains with the two lou@@ pe in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you need to wait briefly , while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . this can be avoided in which you can re@@ generate all the thumb@@ nails in the menu ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; information on each image are shown below the image preview . what information these are , you can change about settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will have help windows , the tiles . if you can rest the mouse @-@ cursor for a moment about a picture . the scre@@ enshot shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot shows in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
&quot; photos are all to see it at &amp; checking ; go . albums and keywords will allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach all the functions that are equipped with &amp; checking ; you can get the choice between the viewing menu of the preview or the menu image in the menu bar . you can choose between the viewing of the images , a gas@@ asch@@ au or the editing of pictures . &quot;
you can open the image processing using a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or select the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and edit ... select a guide how to edit your photos . with the image processing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it can happen that &amp; checking came ; the functionality you need , not available . you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button . here , and how you adjust it to your needs , you will find information in &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after the processing by other image processing programs can come about problems with the met@@ adata page . some programs do not store this data with if you save the changed image . by doing this , this information comes from EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture , etc . &quot;
&quot; there came two ways of rotation . the easiest way to select it with the right mouse button on the preview and select turning . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click with the right mouse button on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . note that you maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; when you came a photo of &amp; checking , it will move in the tr@@ ash@@ can of &amp; k@@ de ; shifted . f@@ 8 image del@@ eting or Ent@@ f If you prefer truly del@@ eting , you can use this by using Shift . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organize your photos according to the data . &amp; checking , use either the EX@@ IF @-@ Date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; when you select one month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the image view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet in the date view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords presents a flexible and powerful option to organize your photos and cat@@ alo@@ ise . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or whole groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo may be found through the selection of this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos , marked with this key@@ word , are shown . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . this is through you can arrange your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also cl@@ ap parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word &quot; , &quot; so you can find the keywords which you are looking for , easy to find . &quot;
&quot; the tags are stored in a database for quick access and weights in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JP@@ EG , so you can also use your tags in other programs . besides , the tags are imported to the loss of the database as soon as &amp; checking ; the pictures are noticed . &quot;
&quot; you can add new tags by clicking with the right mouse button , either on &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; or click on an existing key@@ word . if you have clicked a new key@@ word after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this is a sub@@ word of this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and del@@ eting . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keywords will be removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by drag it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then there &apos;s a menu that gives you the option to move on . a key@@ word can only be in a tree at a time .
&quot; you can change the properties of a key@@ word by clicking it with the right mouse button and select in the context menu key@@ word . you can change the name of the word , and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as album icon , you need to select the picture with the right mouse button and in the context menu . you can also drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; checking ; s functionality with key@@ word to be able to handle , you must first select your photos with key@@ word . you can also drag them onto the appropriate key@@ word in the tree &amp; quot ; My key@@ word ; you can also click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can select a photo with any number of words . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords him to a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with key@@ word , this is displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word in which you can open with the right mouse button and select the menu menu . the menu shows you only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent h@@ isto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can select through this h@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you only need to click on the bottom rec@@ tan@@ gle of the selection frame , the timing is displayed . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , collections , collections , data boards , and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ ula &apos;s search box is a small lamp the green becomes the green when searching for results . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search did not find anything , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; advanced search tool is hidden in the rider on the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ escope . if you open this , you can save this search here but as a live search that has always been fil@@ tered out what you have been stored as a search criterion . after you saved the ad &apos;s filter on the list . &quot;

&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the search search provides you with an exp@@ and@@ able search form with many search@@ engines available , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ tization ; s database can be search . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to add the options to search for a search query in the database database . all rules can be added to this list with search group all ... , One ... , N@@ one ... or a least ... link . in addition , you can create the type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; checking it ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this enables it to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two images of sig@@ natures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar one . using a g@@ ell@@ er@@ ts the results selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture of somewhere over the symbol of the un@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar then it will open up and you can drop it there .
sketch : open hand color sketch : draw a quick sketch and checking ; find the matching images . also here can a spon@@ ge be set .
this rider represents an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can stick with the mouse wheel or out zo@@ oming . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and indicated . of course this requires ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; he came on a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image formats , also raw files . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more pictures from any point of view in the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em bul@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light table and open its windows . main window , you can open the light table with L ex@@ tras lumin@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; from the thumb@@ side@@ bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and drop it there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you preview , select from the tool@@ bar and select Zoo and deportation operations to one of the pictures , so they can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to edit quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise to navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the area . use the right adjacent picture in the right field . this makes it easier to work through a number of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ der @-@ actions work directly from the light table , such as F@@ 4 file ... &quot;
&quot; all pictures from the right side@@ bar of the main window are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; in the lower end of each section you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . to click the visible area of the picture , you must click this an@@ click and the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both images will show the same image area . &quot;
&quot; the zo@@ oming works just as in other views . simply use the zoom @-@ controller under the images or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , in the image and beyond . this happens in both pictures , if you are in the mode preview . &quot;
&quot; what is a digital transformation - aside from the bu@@ zz@@ word ? digital conversion management considers every part of the process of follows after the image has been made up to the final issue and the permanent storage . each of the photos records , sc@@ anned or digital photos carries out a form of digital administration . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect , and use photos . we consider the downloading , ren@@ ame , remove , optimize , evaluate , optimize , optimize , wait , and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; quot ; Digital Management Board takes on , inde@@ xes , categ@@ orized , secur@@ es , seeks , transforms and exports content that have a mon@@ ial or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
&quot; met@@ adata is defined as data on data . met@@ adata is provided according to your definition data , which can provide information about or documentation of other data that are managed by an application or environment . &quot;
&quot; I dare to claim if you need more than 1000 photos on your machine , then you don &apos;t even need how many photos you have . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t want to save fast Search and a secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you do and need to know before you want to integrate anything into your system , building information structure in contrast to data structure . your image files must somehow be stored on your computer , whether you want to save them on a reserved drive or on a network run &amp; etc ; make sure that you have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; you might be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be found quickly through your memory location unless you were in a year several times in the same place . the rest of the photos will be made using your date . then you will export sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; then export is a folder for pictures that you print or publish on a web page . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as re@@ sion@@ ing the photos , archiving , work@@ flows , constant supply of pictures on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the pile @-@ processing simpler . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a derived image .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ adata option to activate in the settings page . this ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data will be written in the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the met@@ adata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change ? this puts a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , since you should now select any photo keywords , marking and evaluation . of course , you can select all the pictures that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense as you can concentrate on the best photos at the best rate . &quot;
&quot; now let us take a key@@ word , keywords , as you are often hot in other programs or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you have cat@@ alo@@ ized pictures from another source with embedded key@@ word , then the digi@@ tization of the hierarchy inside the tree is not a problem and can simply be done by moving one sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are being pursued by &amp; checking ; updated as it pursu@@ es the under@@ trees . &quot;
the graphics shows how different met@@ adata : this is a very rough representation as each block of met@@ adata is made in truth from many sections . file names and calendar dates are properties of all pictures .
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to compl@@ ying or comments , the third important tool to cat@@ alo@@ ise your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; you want to let most anyone share your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; check out this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that is the Lan@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is again present , you may possibly even hear the silence . the marking has changed your perception of this panoramic position . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider the title is probably more important than the picture itself to produce an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help you understand the motive it has moved , what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is ok when a picture is not perfect , if the strength has only a label for himself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as cap@@ tion . you can even export it for a selection of pictures at the same time . K@@ DE will even tell you for your wishes in the let@@ tering and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eries . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without the navigation system ? it was not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation goes already with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ c@@ alisation are already innumerable and will be deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can export your travels through images with geographical coverage . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps viewer . &quot;
&quot; copy@@ left is a word game with copyright and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms are also valid in all the changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information came in the furnishings site of &amp; checking ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creators and author ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to protect the name of a company or organization , then the name of a company or organisation may not be changed once again . this field does not support comp@@ mas nor sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for fiber bar ) : associated with the author . this field contains the working copy of the photographer . examples of this can be titles as : employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note on the author &apos;s field , this must be filled in as well . &quot;
&quot; editor ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the provider to identify who offers the photo . this does not necessarily be the author , then these organizations can be listed here . if the image is presented here , the group / Agency will display the image here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator , can delete or modify this . the solution for this problem is digital water@@ marks . for individuals this is very important for professionals and half @-@ pros . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; checking ; will be able to provide such a module for st@@ acking processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : record error , record failure , electricity poles , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , age , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these types of losses are the same which can also happen in traditional paper sn@@ apshots or neg@@ atives . in this section we are about problems with the so @-@ called new media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll On@@ track , the largest data collection of the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem of CDs / DVDs , they need to be treated more cautious and you may not be longer than a couple of years . of course , you can also find CDs and DVDs in archives . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece that claim a lifetime of 100 years . whether you believe it is in your surve@@ ying room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable but you can use this risk where you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more reliable than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . it is therefore about the right select . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to fault , even if you just have written it . therefore use a control mechanism to protect yourself . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ atting and control environment . despite this massive protection they need for the form@@ atting and control light , scrat@@ ched light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a cheaper program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster which seems to be miracles for CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; but there are also similar applications available from damaged flo@@ ppy disk , hard disk , flash drives , USB drives etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to win the tro@@ phy War against the HD DVD . a dual Lay@@ er Blu @-@ ray Disk can save 50 GB and thus almost h@@ sm@@ al the capacity of a dual Lay@@ er DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs also applies to Blu @-@ ray disk .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recording unit on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated media . then read the media with a description , date &amp; author marks and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and in front of animals protected place . do not forget to read the data on the next generation of hardware or software . read the last piece of hardware or software that can read these media . &quot;
&quot; disco manufacturers retain your statistics for themselves . your production guarantees includes a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of dis@@ ks : dis@@ error study &quot;
&quot; shortly : dis@@ ks hold the longest when you are operated in the temper@@ ament range from 35 ° C to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , the error can not determine the most common fault of error , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . some of the SM@@ ART determined errors will terminate the immediate im@@ pending failure . these are especially readers and evac@@ uation line . the expected life time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only about the whole loss of losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric power if you have secured the files , but these losses normally leave without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment electricity poles do not amount much , this can cause heavy damage with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause heavy damage , complete data loss , hardware aging , destructive mother@@ boards and other defects . therefore protect yourself from the un@@ avo@@ ids that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
the most widespread protection against electricity tops is an excess protection . this is a device that is absorbed in the form of energy heat and the rest . it is usually available in the form of a slot list . but remember that not each plug @-@ in also contains an over@@ voltage protection .
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ tension protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also pay attention to the protection against ligh@@ tening envelope , thus protecting the correctly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage each cable can use to your machine , you should pay attention to that also all Peri@@ ph@@ eri@@ als that can be connected to your system . some manufacturers also provide telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable carrier and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travelling . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection your system protects from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . even an incident of few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a non @-@ breaking power supply . &quot;
&quot; besides the protection from the sp@@ ans , these devices can automatically make cordless energy available when a black@@ out comes . this gives you the possibility to store your data and load the system . however , if you purchase a US@@ V then you should be sure that they have the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the underlying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; concerns the potential risk which is exposed to your machine system and compare your safety when you are concerned with electricity costs . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your machine is protected . to conclude , you should always remember all the cables before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S@@ 3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use this as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as a backup goal for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , compared to the hard disk drives , however , very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollar ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data about the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the Photo @-@ Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are limited to photos . your free memory is available on 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . your free memory is more available to you , in case of Flickr dramatically more . for $ 25 per year you get unlimited memory , which should be reviewed in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data protection , the web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically ber@@ ized with the TCP protocol and the large companies are included in the supply of a backup and a shared memory . &quot;
&quot; the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in calcul@@ ator . all transfers are prone to transmission error . the file system z@@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and drive safe . &quot;
&quot; the worst thing is that no one tells you when a transmission error occurred , not if this is in your hardware . all these distur@@ ban@@ ces remain un@@ discovered until you have been able to open a photo until you one day . no one seems to have thought in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data away than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; in@@ reliable power parts are another source of transmission losses as they create interfer@@ ing within the data flows . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transfer issues , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates to be able to handle and scale up . it is open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL @-@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its pale file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms that are used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the core .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss at the notebook and 46 % at job systems . in not@@ ebooks the proportion of theft is 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than the Me@@ ists think . it leads to a lower damage , e.g. theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft @-@ Systems ; Apple users know only very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no longer has been spot@@ ted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , cancellation , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent cor@@ rup@@ ting data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process in a sudden break during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . if a file is not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings of fundamental physical borders . it is that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics are no longer far away from this border .
today cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el@@ sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is more deterior@@ ating . a sensor size of 6 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel and high quality optics are the optimum for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras require a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone interested in data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a data loss . so secure your data often according to a plan and test this backup before making any something dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of plates or the size change of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external drive drive . if , then one day , a lightning strike will have you luck when the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget air@@ worthy oil : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ prevention means always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as mentioned above is a frequent reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save it one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files will be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
&quot; differential backup : a backup of the files changed since the last complete backup , generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last differential backup . &quot;
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . it creates several mom@@ entary shots . you can restore the original status at any time with the exception that it is only f@@ ta@@ xed and not continuous continuously .
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily set up on your machines . in contrast to script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ cription copied r@@ sync just the difference of files that have been really changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security through ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you stored them on your computer to a DVD or other optical medium .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover losses and restore it . at the same time you come up for backup , however with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of the working files . at the end you will have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least a month and a snapshot of each month . each additional th@@ inner should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file stored IP@@ TC data , original X@@ MP files , original reserve , memory , scal@@ ability , media , playback of images and met@@ adata , copy images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that is about the time period in which you really are interested in your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you need to consider everything today with caution and rate new ones during the time . unfortunately , there is no other option than a certain vigil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is now available for everyone . so , if you have an old system to read your pictures , then save it and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and safety technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay in open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist for the possibility to change a system in its size . this is actually growing .
&quot; let &apos;s assume that you have planning the scal@@ ability , and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this section and shift it to a new record : &quot;
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g , if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them one . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; Dollar ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software more you can read it , then you can create yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; gi@@ f is a proprietary , patented format that disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was developed as an open source standard designed by G@@ IF . but it can save a lot more . P@@ NG can save the relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but not as many as TI@@ FF , but this format we would like to recommend you to save your pictures . &quot;
TI@@ FF has been widely used as picture format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ zi@@ pped shape or in a container with a loss of free compression rate ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) but a problem is however that this format is adjusted by many people . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw material that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed at the TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope that the DN@@ G is now available and we hope that the competitors at Canon and Nikon was able to use it at some point .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why in 2001 , Adobe his XML @-@ based X@@ MP plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . it is a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers take it in front of an original of your recording , mostly in the raw format , to archi@@ ved . X@@ MP adap@@ ts to it , since it doesn &apos;t notice the met@@ adata separately from the image file . therefore , you should think whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put everything there together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to completely compatible online met@@ adata , which includes a large area of application and modelling , discussions and community activities in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and the D@@ C@@ MI collabor@@ ations , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and educational efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures on cam@@ am@@ edi@@ um are , you can use this as temporary backup . &quot;
convert the raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not implemented yet .
&quot; for refin@@ ing processing , you can use external programs . if you edit the pictures again with &amp; checking ; edit , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut under circumstances from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the edited paintings for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export it first in Web@@ Gall@@ eries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking ; to get in section adding a photo to an album you can add a description , as you can already have on your hard disk . however , the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings to import images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them to the machine , switch the camera on the display mode and switch it on . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , this tries to connect to your camera . when the connection is made , a pig@@ gy indicator appears at the lower end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . however , some cameras represent no thumb@@ nails at the bottom and displayed a symbol for file order for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information to each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the characteristics of an item or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file characteristics and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that in some digital cameras , not all information is available . &quot;
&quot; the tab met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the met@@ adata page from the main window of &amp; checking ; or the image processing . note that these met@@ adata for some digital cameras are not available . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on your machine is the click on the button download and then download the selection from your camera into one single album , and we recommend you check if the pictures were downloaded safely in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the required ones with the default choices by &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the button download and then download the selected item . the button @-@ chosen download is long as long as you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; when your camera supports this , a config option is available . these pictures have been downloaded until now and downloaded . in this case , the new pictures have been downloaded with a star in advance window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you download the buttons All download or download selected , a dialog window appears , with which you can select the target album , displayed in section My albums . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and checking ; invites the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete it from the camera . you can delete all of them at once , by using the button Dele@@ te All . if you just want to delete some , you must first select it and use it deleted . &quot;
&quot; please note that there are no possibility to restore photos you deleted from the camera ; therefore the photos have not been deleted if you want to delete photos from the camera ; if you want to delete it from the camera . if you want to delete it from the camera , you should use it over the cam@@ el game , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as a file name for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually re@@ valued as the photos can be deleted from the camera . therefore , it can be useful to integrate the date and time when the picture was taken to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for the turning and mirrors of the image , and for dat@@ e@@ based subjects . if you use this latter option , automatically one folder per day is created . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three additional options to be performed before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two concerns the data about the author in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the appropriate entries from EX@@ IF data in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct the date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
if you wish a different file format as the standard format you can use e.g. in the processing field the pre@@ fix phot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % S : % S . switch to the option date &amp; time . for further adap@@ tations you should read the help of the instruction program .
&quot; if you use the option camera file , you have the option to change the file names in small letters . or in large case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; for a photo is used , the camera is displayed in the preview . your settings to ren@@ ame are stored and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; on the map , all information about the orientation of camera can use to carry out an automatic spin during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in section page side@@ bar Met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera is embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic spin is usually switched on , and if your camera does not supply this information , leaves the button in the original orientation . if you want to switch the automatic spin @-@ off , use the button below and select the Autom@@ atic rotation at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera information about the date on which the photo has been made available , this can use it to create automatically sub@@ mit@@ es in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub@@ album . all images with the same date are downloaded to the same sub@@ album . in section page side@@ bar Met@@ a data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case saves &amp; checking ; the photos directly on the target album . if you want to change this option . use the button below and select the option date @-@ based sub@@ stit@@ ches at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from their hosts on their camera is the button download . then select the file dialog dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files , which are up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; once the image selection has been done , asks &amp; checking ; you where the images are to be loaded into the camera . pick the folder dialog for the camera . select the folder click here and press OK to start the up@@ loading . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . it is a position that is indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude , and which can be displayed on a map . the identification of the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers can link it interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses a plane to make an area by automatic recording of GPS data on carto@@ graphy . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten it , where exactly the photo was done , you can click with a click on a browser which indicates the area . if you want to document a postcard to another &amp; checking ; users want to document the place of photos so it is good the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card refer@@ enced . there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical assignment ( manual ) and finally via the manual entry of known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a ticket module or through transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be stored with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . however , you must save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , as this is the only format which is supported by the module to the geographical assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data from pictures and GPS . on the following page you can do the same under &amp; Linux : g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes or other data , then you can use this script using the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the signs of hairy coordinates that are created for example by m@@ ap@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; m@@ ap@@ s.@@ google@@ .com shows no European street cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all the navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; he came to give you so much control over your work@@ flows as possible . there are many settings to access the behavior of &amp; checking ; set up on these settings ; you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; this action can be displayed on embedded preview or picture editing . thus , you can set the default behavior of &amp; checking ; fixed if you click on an entry in the main view . &quot;
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the Stand@@ ardi@@ denti@@ ty and copyright data . these data are automatically selected into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields . these data are automatically selected in the IP@@ TC data . also with a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; title is a syn@@ onym for fiber line : this field should be the professional photographer of the photographer . these can be desig@@ nations like e.g. employee photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . as this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; editor is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to specify the photo . this does not have to be the author , then these organizations should be registered here as this is the image of other &amp; quot ; prot@@ en@@ quot ; . if the image is a stock photo , then the group or agency that is available here will be counted here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC campaigns save the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC field . thus , the met@@ adata is permanently available in the image and are not only available in the database of &amp; checking ; these met@@ adata also are available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; publications . &quot;
&quot; image ri@@ ft@@ ings as embedded accus@@ ations ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG pictures , this syn@@ ced the comments that you add to your photos , with which included in the pictures can also be read by other image subjects . therefore , your fittings can also be read by the articles already ; over@@ written . &quot;
&quot; the page settings contains all options for the information that appear , when the mouse cursor in the main window via a file rests . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; checking it ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types and checking came ; display , you can add the file exten@@ tions of this list and remove it . each file in a &amp; checking came ; Alb@@ any folder , which has none of these extensions , ignored by &amp; checking ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; default settings can be set back again by pressing the button Re@@ fresh right of each category . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the lighthouse of &amp; checking came on this page . however , if you then open the light table , however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole image size lad@@ en@@ quot ; you should only use on fast calcul@@ ators . if you have one , then you can hereby get better test results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the photos shown . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can switch the tool@@ bar when you use the image processing mode . &quot;
excess and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with darker or bri@@ ghter color in the image . these colors will be set here . in the image processing this picture mode can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ aire than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the near@@ er explanation .
&quot; with the setting P@@ NG compres@@ sing you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation is not reduced the image quality , as P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . the only effect is that the Bil@@ dd@@ les have a loss of high compression . here means 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
with the option TI@@ FF files you can switch the de@@ fl@@ ate compression rate for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no influence on the image quality since the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm loss is working .
&quot; with the setting of loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save los@@ sy . even if you posted the los@@ sy setting , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , met@@ adata still did not support , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; checking , image processing was only a sculptor for photos . currently , it quickly develops into a tool for manipulation your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default output is that all green pixels are the same . if you use this option with delicate lines in the issue . if you use this option , solve this problem with a minimum loss of details . this option paints the image a little soft , but elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 char@@ s with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD @-@ quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white board is inserted in the camera . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only when the whit@@ eboard is not set . standard , it is a fixed color balance , based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images get more details in the sh@@ re@@ ones . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the top @-@ gentle , so the parts of your pictures are burned out , because of the in@@ ability of your camera to capture the top @-@ like white . in addition , use the setting @-@ out white into the settings . finally , you can try to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ ell@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast as green and red . checking , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still not saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question , how much color or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three one compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image separately . &quot;
&quot; set the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ ler to your taste . you probably need to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . but this can also be done later in the picture options of the &amp; digi@@ tization . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
a demo@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ fil@@ tered images that have many cameras and which represents a matrix color@@ less pixel . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation or Color construction .
&quot; &amp; checking came ; and D@@ cra@@ w put you three alternatives : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it looks like this . V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation ( vari@@ able number of gra@@ dients ) was interesting if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color devi@@ ation of your lenses , you can put the red and blue proo@@ fing values here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , since it is performed during the rough conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions like this to be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ tization ; information such as the color information of a color tree in the other are thus the colors as accurately as possible .
&quot; behavior questions , if a picture is opened in image processing , run / color management module with raw files . &quot;
&quot; color Profile Set@@ ting you here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &amp; checking , this folder will then check out during the start . &quot;
&quot; settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profile to sne@@ ak , everything can be changed when opening the raw file . &quot;
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here are only your pictures colored not the entire screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera producer and model that you use . not all profiles are included in the same way . currently , cra@@ b Gamma does not exist for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color scheme itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be given from one device . this is very useful before you print image , as your printer can make a smaller color area as your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated with it , instead of rel@@ ying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious that color profile is planned for them . unfortunately , not by the models of Canon . therefore , here is a table of cameras and profiles together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; Canon pro@@ filing allows the style to realise the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin interface . it is an interface which is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; images and image processing ; many modules support they have been written to collaborate with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules that you want to use , and these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will also find some also in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks to be carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under settings of short commands . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get over the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the di@@ asch@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ ates the time between the images , usually they are 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other an@@ cross@@ bars turn the met@@ adata to or from which appears at the lower end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all currently supported cameras . on the right there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , which is trying to identify the camera properly , switched on and in the image mode . beneath you are the portals . currently , here , serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage are supported . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wi@@ re@@ - ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) - mass storage camera . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / cri@@ es , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , you need to connect the camera to your machine , put them in the ad mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; try out if &amp; checking came ; the camera automatically recognises . if not , you can set cam@@ er@@ od@@ ell and port manually . after you set up your camera , your camera will appear in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confir@@ ming dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can , you can adjust the conversation of &amp; checking ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections delete a photo and del@@ eting one album you will find more details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ kled through &amp; checking ; applied , if you use the option changes to the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise , you need to save the changes with the button amendments . &quot;
you can also submit the review of the Welcome screen of &amp; digi@@ tization ; in circumstances the start @-@ up process of &amp; checking came .
&quot; the setting will look for a new photos to search for new photos , which came to search for new or deleted albums / photos ; this extends the starting folder for new or deleted albums / pictures . if something out of the basic folder was deleted , asks &amp; checking ; you whether it is to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schem@@ as can be used in &amp; checking ; used to adjust the main window to your tastes . these settings can be selected among settings design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find more information about this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; &amp; nbsp ; contains a quick image processing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image processing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or by the context menu , preview and selection of the display advertisements . &quot;
&quot; image processing contains a number of tools to improve your pictures . thus , some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ tization . thus , they are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can find in section image processing . &quot;
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current file account , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size shows . &quot;
&quot; a menu bar on the upper edge , and including the tool@@ bar to quickly access the most frequently needed functions . &quot;
&quot; the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you can save file save or the button save from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so , you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it as save . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu File Res@@ cue or the button re@@ producing the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you then lose any change you have carried out in the photo since the last store . &quot;
almost every action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed by selecting editing back or restored by selecting editing from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make yourself the short@@ cut abbrevi@@ ation , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; via the back@@ sliding or re@@ producing button in the tool@@ bar a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu items , all actions are also revers@@ ed and restored . &quot;
&quot; once you started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , image down or the entries in the menu . if you have made changes in the current photo , you will ask if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can get in the photo in and out of zo@@ oming in which you use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar , or use the entries in the An@@ si@@ eve menu . &quot;
&quot; to custom@@ ise a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : extension factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view full screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you come into the normal view , in which you can use the Es@@ c button . usually , you can view this in the settings dialog by &amp; digi@@ tization . see this you can view the section on installation of image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can select the menu image and get the standard &amp; k@@ de ; press dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual pictures or whole sentences . whole picture @-@ looking pages can choose from your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the default methods and select from the menu album expor@@ ting menu . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; main window has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides important information and promotions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available , without the navigation file , even in the image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on : &quot;
&quot; multiple clicks , because the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear or disappear into the edge . &quot;
&quot; in the compl@@ ying review , you can insert cap@@ ri@@ ft@@ ings with unlimited size or insert it . note that all special characters are permitted . the compl@@ ains will be copied to EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are copied after 2000 signs and special characters are re@@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC description field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented , you can either use the button or simply change to the next picture , the cap@@ ri@@ gs are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the applying button , there is one button More . with this you can read more met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , this will always be performed if you choose a met@@ adata setting , which is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the review review shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in Search and Sor@@ ti@@ des . it can be used either with a single mouse @-@ click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . the rating from the side@@ bar is always applied to a picture . to select several pictures at the same time select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the schema in the following table :
&quot; the sampling view shows a search box to filtering the keywords , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously presented in this &amp; checking ; -@@ session en@@ quired key@@ word . &quot;
the sampling tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the search word . you can easily limit the number of ways in finding a key@@ word quickly . this ability is particularly useful when you have lots of keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is a further relief when entering a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by flag@@ ging the relevant an@@ cross @-@ fields in the tree . all the words of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when several pictures are selected in the main view and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this is only applied to the highlighted picture and not on the whole selection , if you want to have a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ note section . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ side@@ bar code is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side@@ bar with their album , - file , keywords and view@@ points are used . if additionally one or more sampling filter from the right side is displayed , only the interface of these two will be displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop off . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can simply drag it out of the right side@@ bar and put it on the selection . then a dialogue you ask whether you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example shows the main window the images on a calendar tag . the sampling filter is written on no keywords , which has been selected by C@@ tr@@ l + a , and then a key@@ word was drawn from the right point of key@@ word on the selection and put it there . a dialogue asks if this key@@ word should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at any start of the program . it can also be retri@@ eved among other settings .
&quot; if you use a rule with and created it and discover that it should be one or its , you can easily change this with a double @-@ click on the text and in the rules . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry to which is being searched in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , key@@ word , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the oper@@ ator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can set a complete search for all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the cross field at the end of the rule and afterwards the button group . the options then look as follows : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web or Flickr not listed ? the free space is limited there on 1 GB and you will not want to save the pictures in the full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have worked mainly on &amp; checking ; s concrete implementation adapted .
&quot; the reason why you use a color@@ fully managed work@@ flow , the colors that are actually photographed by your camera or scanner . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow , you can easily reach that the colors on your monitor are identical to your camera or scanner , and the colours you print or publish on the web that you are using your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme comes in colour administration , everybody wants to know which buttons he must push for the results he wants . unfortunately , the purpose of this tutorial is to provide you with adequate background information about color management . in addition , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions so that you will receive the desired results . &quot;
&quot; if your work@@ work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you must not take care of color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ R@@ GB farms . ( further information can be found below )
your only other picture expendi@@ tures are by e @-@ mail or the web where s@@ R@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is .
so if s@@ R@@ GB works so well and life for everyone is so easy why you should then use a different color tree and to make thoughts about color management ?
&quot; a visual example of limitation of s@@ R@@ GB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ fi@@ ery region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB farms , the tri@@ angular area . &quot;
if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger color spaces so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms and click on info and then click Information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces .
do I have to drill my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ R@@ GB Far@@ br@@ room ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB mode or do not , you need to monitor your monitor , since s@@ R@@ GB , so you need to work your monitor . if you are working in the s@@ R@@ GB of s@@ R@@ GB , you have to either use your monitor on the s@@ R@@ GB standard , you need to use your monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore use it before you attempt a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , deriv@@ ative , automation of the same and contrast , extend from the menu Cor@@ rection Autom@@ atic correction automatically try to make your colors the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , in order to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method sc@@ aled the lumin@@ osity level over the entire image so that the dark@@ est point is black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its color variation . this feature is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out .
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ ates the lumin@@ ance factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the Inten@@ sity represents the same number of pixels . sometimes , the resulting very good results in improving the object of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that leads either wonders with an image or it is destroyed . &quot;
&quot; automatic abbrevi@@ ation : this method maxim@@ izes the color area in the red , green , and blue @-@ channel . you will find the dark and bright bor@@ der@@ ones and j@@ us@@ ks the red , green and blue channels on the complete h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
contrast : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image through the move of the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in excess pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ right correction is slightly limited as a color foam with 8 @-@ bit per color will be worked . in case you can perform too far from original image , areas with over@@ exposure occur . in case you are working out the whit@@ eboard in the raw mode , your possibilities for correction will be better . &quot;
&quot; this tool is based on a white @-@ equation by the copyright of Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . they start it via the menu @-@ yield colours white @-@ like of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails can be adjusted in size . on the left side , both the original image and preview of the target image . the preview is dynam@@ ically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original whi@@ p again , then it &apos;s enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the destination pictures has a red mark@@ er . the le@@ ver@@ ance of the Pix@@ els under this mar@@ ker is shown as vertical line in the H@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right above , a h@@ isto@@ gram appears that dynam@@ ically changed once you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful because , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small le@@ ver@@ ages . with one button you can decide whether one of the three colors or your sum is shown . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow allows you to improve the shadow details of your photos or also trim down . &quot;
&quot; an@@ stat with the above controls to play , you should use the color @-@ temperature p@@ p@@ ette . press on this button and then somewhere on the image show to use selected color for the calculation of the color temperature of the whit@@ eboard . this way , the temperature and green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the whit@@ eboard with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indic@@ ator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the Pix@@ els is over@@ exposed .. They will display the combined result in the white color . this is shown in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and charging exactly this . every setting of the whit@@ eboard you have set , you can save it into a text file and load it later . &quot;
&quot; the button pres@@ ets pres@@ upp@@ oses all filtering values once again on its standard values and its associated neutral tin@@ plate . note that even neutral settings will be revealed to another photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will change . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust here the codi@@ les per colour @-@ channel of the edited image . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality pictures . this co@@ ding requires also more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is also available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of blan@@ king images . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter colour administration . &quot;
another important tool can be found in the menu under colors ton@@ ic Surgery . this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or scanner is always the same correction . in the manual on tape correction you will find more information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool at the gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool Far@@ ming effects introduces you four color effects , a solar system effect , a ne@@ on effect and a se@@ wer filter at your disposal . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was Solar@@ isation , also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect of which was created by an partly developed pressure of a short ligh@@ tening and afterwards the development of the picture was completed . the result was a partial neg@@ atively of the image . this tool allows you to fin@@ alize this interesting effect fin@@ ely . &quot;
the intensity controls the solar system . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what chem@@ ically possible is possible . another increase finally creates a neg@@ ativity that is not to generate on phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier .
this is an example of solar energy efficiency . the original image is the ( 1 ) and that process the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a sati@@ ation that he makes a stronger contradiction effects which makes the colors brilliant and glo@@ wing . try it simply , it em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for one on day@@ light optimization color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the characteristics is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth picture structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some photo @-@ ograph@@ s especially those little landscapes ab@@ outs too much .
&quot; the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contradiction . the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the sli@@ der repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ ment . at large pictures , the filter can hold the entire CPU for one moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon for you to fix the color contra@@ sting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your alignment can be seen in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
&quot; if you can make a photo with bad light conditions , you can get the reverse problem : one too big satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation will be a good choice for satur@@ ation rather than raising them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex tool Gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool for sound correction to improve exposure . even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated , you need for the purposes described here only the area of the sliding . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the h@@ isto@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the Inten@@ sive values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected range . under the graphs are three sli@@ ders into the inside , and the left side represents the dark ones and the right side are the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the image can be viewed dynam@@ ically . the preview is dynam@@ ically , based on the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the h@@ isto@@ gram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is shown . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear display of a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ators : the top one for the dark sounds , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle notes , often called Gam@@ ma@@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ boards can be used in the preview of the original image of the original image , middle @-@ sized and bright tones automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
g@@ ass@@ ed : the g@@ ass@@ esses allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regul@@ ators who can be used to modify the g@@ ass@@ esses inter@@ actively as in the input data . the compression of the g@@ ass@@ esses may be used for example to create a hidden image as a background while something different is to be seen .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set to dependence on the intention of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as a store and store : with these buttons , the displayed values can be stored in the file system and re@@ charged later . in addition , the Gimp levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes use , the input holes are automatically rev@@ oked for all shade , means , and Sundays . activate the paint pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the preview of the original image of the H@@ isto@@ gram for Rot@@ - , green@@ - , blue , and the umin@@ escence channels . &quot;
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome .
&quot; below you can see an example of the adjustment of the input competition applied to the red , green and blue Channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha Channel , as well as the off@@ ences are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , half of the original is displayed and the target image appears . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this drop @-@ box allows the channel to specify the channel is changed by the module :
&quot; besides this box , two symbols are set to change between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures that are absorbed by a digital camera , the linear mode is the most meaningful way . for pictures with large areas of constant color , the linear mode produces a broad beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cour@@ ier line to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds can be cor@@ rup@@ ed with dark out@@ ga@@ stri@@ s and that the image pixels will be darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark@@ er to see . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve that is the original value . create a point on this line and move up until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as a store and store : with these buttons you can make exactly this . each curve that you have generated can be saved in the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . the file format is the Gimp format .
&quot; when you create this method and the three color pi@@ pet@@ ted buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and Sundays . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image for the rot@@ ary , green@@ - , blue and lam@@ bing curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combined outcome . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ white photo , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ channel . shadow and Sundays was applied with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the channel bl@@ ender of the &amp; publications came ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the shades of the photos .
the canal bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel bl@@ ender of image processing .
with the se@@ al@@ op@@ box you can select the color for the H@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you an initial note as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and swing . the left area of the window shows you a preview . the original can be viewed as a comparison of your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture appears a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram to show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to easily mix these channels . if you can activate the appropriate color components , as the channel bl@@ ender then DAS tool for generating great black @-@ white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ rom , the reduction of a colour comes to a visible smoking , which does not appear in the same place in the colour canal and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that &apos;s the case , you can improve your mon@@ och@@ rom conversion , in which you will reduce the bre@@ wers at first . &quot;
storing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can save you with it for later and then load it . the used file format is the Gimp channel mix@@ er format .
the option over@@ exposure indi@@ k@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined outcome of all channels . this is an indicator that means you get the effect only in the preview and there is no effect on the final outcome .
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel is newly built . the option L@@ umin@@ anz is enabled . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
black / white @-@ photography was always intrigu@@ ing because of your abstr@@ action ability . with the development of digital photography is black / white a working step as color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll@@ profiles .
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super &quot;
green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lin@@ sen@@ filter . this looks good in all scenario images and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 c@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) green filter .
Oran@@ filmed : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange filter filter . this enhances landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so much like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Oran@@ gery . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lin@@ sen@@ filter . this creates dramatic king @-@ effects and can simul@@ ate c@@ lich@@ ens at the time of time . so much like the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm bright and medium tones while it adds a bit cold in the s@@ att@@ age . this is very similar to the process of expression of a pressure and the re @-@ development in a S@@ epi@@ at@@ scho@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool texture can be used to apply decorative textures to one image . &quot;
&quot; adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points , or like a wall image on a wall . the menu @-@ yield image texture use the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the semb@@ lance of depth and three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image .
a paper text box has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter Rel@@ ief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; checking ; tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the image a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stream eye . under the picture frame add the module from the image processing can be started .
&quot; type : with this parameter you place the desired field type for your image . thoroughly finishes the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black @-@ white pictures ) , che@@ wing down it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame , ideal for a button @-@ effects and decorative adds a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame in percent . the value range for width is from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image combined with the frame is bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the pictures , especially when you have used the tool After aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text into an image at any location . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text obligation , orientation , color from the color foam and the character set with its properties as you need . you &apos;ll just choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ sighted background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you have chosen for your text may be changed until you press to the button &quot; OK &quot; . once the picture has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking , tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a template via a picture . &quot;
the menu image Sch@@ abl@@ one apply in the image processing can be used to put sten@@ cils over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to work the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of file size of the sten@@ cil . whom you just want to add an e @-@ mail in English to the &amp; checking ; mailing list came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you need to put your string folder with the button @-@ folder folder in the dialog box . select the folder in which you have copied the scr@@ aper file . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root @-@ folder has been set for the sten@@ cils , a tree @-@ view that displays the folder structure of the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ en@@ ord@@ al . the selection of a folder updates the thumb@@ side@@ bar of the sten@@ cils automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the underlying image . it is centered to the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; res@@ ellers : this button reduced the picture below . it is centered to the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole image , you need to make the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move on this button to move the picture below the template . take the picture and place it on the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted . &quot;
&quot; &amp; publications came , three different tools for the sharp@@ ness . each of you has advantages in other areas . &quot;
&quot; shar@@ pen is a traditional tool for the sharp@@ ness . it is very fast and easy , but , especially in dark areas , gran@@ ate pictures . &quot;
awk@@ ward mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture of shar@@ per . in fact it is not a little bit of psych@@ o @-@ visual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it &apos;s a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang .
focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adapt .
photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of depth . elements that are smaller than the resolution are put together with minimal differences to a color point . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more in@@ toler@@ able sharp@@ ness as normal cameras for private use .
&quot; with JP@@ EG pictures , it is often applied to a camera of internal sharp@@ ness . pictures in the raw @-@ format must always be wel@@ ded during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner apply a sharp@@ ness filter already during the reading of the image . if you disable it , you get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get useful results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing shut@@ ters . this allows you to access the menu @-@ yield correlation with the menu @-@ yield . &quot;
&quot; however , you should deal with caution though , as the results do not seem very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also ampli@@ fy the noise . in general , the most suitable technology for sharp@@ ens a tool can focus . under re@@ focus you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is cris@@ p . the solution , the image a little soft to record , is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool to expand with the menu item basket and experiment with you something with settings . the default window on the right of the Di@@ alo@@ t will show you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and preview helps to process the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or amount will enhance the effect . if you make the sharp@@ ness mask too strong , smokers and impression of gr@@ ats will generate close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius is how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter . high @-@ resolution images permit larger radi@@ i . they should therefore shar@@ pen pictures best in their final resolution .
the amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the wi@@ ped image one of the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum R@@ GB value and the apply differential amount . it is therefore possible to define a minimum difference to a channel of filters . in this way areas , areas with a soft change between the sounds are exemp@@ t from the shar@@ pen@@ ed and therefore flaw in faces , He@@ aling and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mask . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the edited image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focus on a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used to use the copyrighted disposal filter by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to re@@ vert a picture of &amp; quot ; re@@ focuss@@ ing quot ; in which it is the de@@ focus . this is better approach than just trying the photo . re@@ focus usually reaches better results than un@@ sharp . you can start it from the menu by using colors re@@ focus in image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular folding divi@@ des is much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung has a very long tail , which is leading far from the source pixel , which is far influenced by the original pixel . the F@@ IR Wiener in@@ verse of the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ altung is even greatly influenced by the distant pixel . caused unwanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . it is the most important parameter for use of this module . you can set a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then take care to hal@@ chers .
correlation : an increase in correlation can help you reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values nearby 1 , &amp; eg ; 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ ens effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filters : an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 @-@ 1 . however , values are higher than 0,@@ 1 only rarely useful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is 0.@@ 03 . a high value is lower the image even further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s edge . use these parameters if your in@@ sharp@@ ness palate is . in most cases , you should let this value be reduced to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . in most cases you should use this value to zero , so you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ ri@@ zen@@ size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ ational size can produce good results , especially if you choose high values for the circular edge or the Gau@@ ß &apos;s edge . note that the module is very slow when you choose high values for these parameters . in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; storing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any number of re@@ focus parameters that you have set will be saved for later , and can then be loaded . &quot;
&quot; try to perform all the cuts , color and Inten@@ ances on the picture before you use the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later left un@@ pleasant ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress pictures , &amp; eg ; as JP@@ EG , you should use the module to apply the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results as shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood than sharp@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , it must have seen un@@ sharp mas@@ king always produce arti@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of in@@ sharp@@ ness . for the Vi@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter at least as well as the sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener filter is often better in the processing of small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is attributable to insufficient light for the Auto @-@ Focus Lin@@ se .
&quot; for more information on the methods for the sharp@@ ness application in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator Smo@@ tte sets the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the area of the black@@ out was bl@@ acked in order to generate a more natural p@@ up@@ ille .
&quot; the colour tin@@ ts allows a customized color for the p@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error is one of the most widely developed tool to remove not desired arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm algorithm was developed by the IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
&quot; this tool contains different preferences as a starting point , in order to simplify the restoration . the available preferences are listed below : &quot;
if you want to use the filter settings on a j@@ us@@ fold you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings .
detail De@@ watering &#91; 0 &#93; 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to a consistent smooth@@ ness over the image . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be given clear that no har@@ ness should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated primarily for homo@@ geneous regions . please note that the detail@@ ing will always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the right direction .
Ri@@ vers dependency Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es even@@ ly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts will create a high value wave @-@ like pattern . JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ te is best removed at a value near 1 .
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all en@@ acted . thus , the relative smooth@@ ing factor defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value suitable to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is we@@ en@@ ched . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; re@@ ps : indicates , how often the algorithm is going through . usually , here is 1 or 2 . &quot;
&quot; angle @-@ wide da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : winds @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is elected , it should also be small chosen . so note that small angles should generate a long run time . so you should choose this value as maximum possible and acceptable to suit your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral stri@@ des &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integrated step @-@ wide in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality you get through the choice of this option is low . he doubles but the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow him to leave .
the buttons save as and charging exactly this . each setting of image errors can be re stored in a text file and re@@ loaded later .
&quot; image defect is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still last very long and a high CPU load gradually pull . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the button crash . &quot;
&quot; below you can see how picture error can be removed with small ar@@ te@@ facts . the module is applied on a photo that was created in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see , there is a strange black arti@@ fact that caused by a poor film storage during the trip ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; Rau@@ reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease che@@ dr@@ au@@ ts . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable picture filters available to remove stain@@ s and other ar@@ te@@ facts that can be removed from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensory images from the camera or mo@@ id ; -@@ effects from c@@ anned images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensor types of digital cameras , so you can read this in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot shows a typical scene that was made with a digital camera and high ISO sensi@@ tiveness . it shows a gran@@ ular smoke that can be successfully removed with this tool .
in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can stay with default settings .
radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time the filters per pixel requires , and the image is spoiled by the radius of the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore smaller faults . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pi@@ vot@@ al effect . this value sets the pixel to look forward to see lumin@@ ous changes . if it is lifted up , smoking tips will be deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter picture details can no longer be received and smo@@ kes or lubric@@ ating again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge di@@ accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the whole noise is removed or noise tips can occur . put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a c@@ aller noise or JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance of the image . we recommend you to change color or ligh@@ tening to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process caused by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color intolerance of the image . we recommend you to change color or ligh@@ tening to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process caused by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controlled the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the image . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ ances of the darker areas , which typically become stronger , increase . however , he also sp@@ ans the down@@ ward areas . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the phosph@@ ate absorption . this value defines as quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius on variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges may appear too high . he can remove noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter at the edges . he can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it . &quot;
&quot; save on and loading : these buttons are used exactly for this . all parameters for the reduction of smoking that you have set , can be stored into the file system and rel@@ o@@ aded later . &quot;
this is an example of how hard @-@ reduction your life can change . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the correc@@ ting with ( 2 ) . the reduction of drugs was applied with default settings .
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution , the image a little soft to record , is fortunately much easier than a picture of shar@@ pen@@ ing . use this tool to add soft@@ ness with the smooth@@ ness . use the default window on the right side of the dialogue shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographic work .
&quot; this filter to restore gives you the opportunity to remove a lot of unwanted ar@@ te@@ facts from your pictures . it is very well adapted to see Gau@@ ß &apos;s smoke , scrat@@ ches , compression ar@@ te@@ facts and local bugs that emerge in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images , and thus gets the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the algorithm can be used for color and text @-@ composition . the text replacement is carried out with another tool , the image error , carried out . the algorithm for restoration was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ ík and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ te reduce : compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that are in un@@ compressed image . this setting is meant to correct these problems . &quot;
the buttons store as well as charging exactly this . every setting of photo restoration can be easily saved into a text file and re@@ loaded later .
photo restoration is compar@@ atively very fast at work . but it can still last very long and a high CPU load gradually pull . you can therefore break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ b button .
&quot; below you can reduce like a photo with like @-@ shaped noise , the module is applied to a black and white photo that with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie bas@@ kets on the faces . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected under ( 2 ) . &quot;
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that has been read by a scanner . you can see the scan ar@@ te@@ facts caused by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; checking came ; tool Hot@@ pixel allows you to remove hot@@ pixel of photos the with a C@@ CD camera that were eight . it uses those algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ ching .
&quot; light , dead or hot pixels are particularly in high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos a problem as many cameras with JP@@ EG compression about a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; name Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; &quot; quot ; light pixel . &quot; &quot; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels . &quot;
download this file into the wizard with the button dark . the tool becomes automatic to detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you can contact the dark picture directly in connection with new hot or bright pixels through C@@ CD Def@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the corrected image . note that the wizard will notice the last dark picture and this automatically invites you to the next meeting . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixel are raised in all field areas .
select an area around the def@@ ective pixel on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these Pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; Dur@@ cut : it will be an average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixel to the block . for 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixel to have a gap of 1 from Pix@@ el@@ block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in block .
square : this is the default fil@@ ter@@ method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels on the block .
Kub@@ o : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are approaching to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the def@@ ective pixel in block .
below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo with a faul@@ ty digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; far @-@ vision objective , especially the middle and large photo format , can not illumin@@ ate the whole sensor range . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light to the sensor there . tele@@ objective will also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; however , he also has cons . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the aper@@ ture filter , which is impossible to hold the camera with the hand . for@@ esi@@ ght lenses , even with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , because otherwise imp@@ aired effects are created . &quot;
&quot; with the great popularity areas of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ ades and color scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by using an equi@@ val@@ ent transformation in a raw image which is applied without these filters . the tool Vig@@ net correction is applied to an image . the algorithm is copyright by John Walker . &quot;
with three re@@ gl@@ ans you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ erungs@@ Surgery filter and with three other exposure to the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light intensity at the point of the greatest density of the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , what an optical filter with a speed setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree of vig@@ net@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast , and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the light intensity of the pixels . you need to re@@ vert the exposure of the target with these options . the regul@@ ator will present you only positive values since you only have to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle enhancement of exposure to the Target , so let the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; digi@@ tization . image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ ting correc@@ tions applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image . a leu@@ ka@@ emia and contra@@ sting correction is also carried out with the image using this tool .
the &amp; checking came ; Lin@@ sen@@ distor@@ tion is a tool to correct the impact of spherical lenses on photos . it uses a copyrighted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric distor@@ tions . coloured distor@@ tions can not be corrected using this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second Gra@@ des deals with the general geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third Gra@@ des has a similar circular effect , fla@@ cht but at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ efficient engra@@ ved Gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposite to the second Gra@@ des . if you combine these two , each geomet@@ ric distor@@ tion can be almost eliminated . &quot;
general : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second Gra@@ des . with negative values can be corrected and positive values @-@ shaped distor@@ tion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ der . this value works stronger at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; corners parameter set the opposite mark of the parameter General . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the size and thus leads to the correction of the first Gra@@ des by . negative values enlarge while positive the picture reduced .
&quot; bri@@ ghten up the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values they increase . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialog with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image will be saved and used as standard values when starting . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ing or low @-@ shaped correction should be carried out in front of all the cutting or size changes . at best , you can cut this correction than any first . if you make a picture new and perform a ton@@ ed correction , the effect is apparent of the fal@@ sely . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction is available to you this tool a vertical and horizontal guide . move it to an important place , like e.g. the sea side or a building wall , inside your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the ton@@ ic / kis@@ sed distor@@ tion with the help of the lines . &quot;
if you correct a ver@@ itable distor@@ tion the resulting image black corners will have . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transform@@ ers out of the image processing or via the zoom re@@ gler of this dialogue .
&quot; for most images , the ton@@ ed correction is made . the next logical step for some motives , such as recordings from the front , frame and painting , it &apos;s the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . note that if you keep the camera by hand you will always have a slight distor@@ tion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ed correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the algorithm is based on a method to simul@@ ate infrared film the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infrared film . see this URL . this film has a sensitive range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO .
&quot; in the left side of the window you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rec@@ tan@@ gle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can simul@@ ate two parameters set the body weight and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option to simul@@ ate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive movie . the ISO regul@@ ator changes the amount of the film gran@@ ule and the dominance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in the transformation . green meadows are white as snow !
&quot; as the filter color channels used to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense the effect on black / white photographs , since the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter being applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the sh@@ ears .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter movie bas@@ kets is a simple to use tool to reproduce cinem@@ atics on your pictures . this is known from classic high speed movies like e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers of large silver bas@@ kets of the photo em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ary effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from daily life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specially in your mono@@ chro@@ ms photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator the ISO @-@ sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the bas@@ ins . the default value is , although often higher values are needed , on ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more gra@@ ins , you can use the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ ular effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the used ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO 1600 .
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil brick produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; checking came ; filter Oil mo@@ cks gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . natural pictures and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to affect this effect . the upper select the brush @-@ size between one and five . thicker brus@@ hes are better suited for big pictures . gl@@ it@@ ated controls the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the scar@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil brick effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processed with the ( 2 ) . brush @-@ size for this 640 pixels wide image is 1 and smooth@@ ness 17 .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ tization came ; filter carbon drawing uses color and Inten@@ sive gra@@ dient to create a carbon t@@ oss . the lines that change the outlines in the drawing are stressed . pictures of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you imagine which scene you would have chosen to sc@@ rolling you . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ators with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper regul@@ ators choose the size and the lower j@@ us@@ hes the contrast ( smooth@@ ness ) .
this is an example of the coher@@ ent filters . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can still be improved by adaptation of the Inten@@ sive value .
the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D as if it was gest@@ ed in wax . it uses a copyrighted algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with pictures with a simple structure where color does not work the most important in content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity , to transform the image into a gray , sophisticated landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds 10 % , is the default . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the depth used is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of distor@@ ting effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : shares the image in cells and lets it look like it is seen through gl@@ ories .
wave blocks 2 : an@@ alogue to wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted here with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can break these effects anytime with the button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into an artwork by means of a sharp@@ ness effects . it uses copyrighted algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image along static lines that go from a central point . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al Un@@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a rotating camera .
removal @-@ sharp@@ ness : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a non@@ focuss@@ ed camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; movement @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed : wi@@ red the image by horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the sharp@@ ness of a linear movements , z : B : from a car or train of photography , camera . &quot;
soft shar@@ ks : bl@@ ur@@ red the image sof@@ tly into the dark and strong in the light tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focuss@@ ed ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ ev@@ acu@@ ity : wi@@ red the image by random shift of the pixels and simul@@ ates the dis@@ sharp@@ ness of a random camera .
intelligent dis@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the bas@@ ins in the image and caught them without change the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then created it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button .
the rain drops are a nice small tool to make shelves on your image . thus it gives natural your images a simple appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
trou@@ gh size it allows the size of the dri@@ p to change . as the trou@@ gh size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish su@@ cks changes the optical effect of the drops on the picture .
&quot; you can keep using the &amp; digi@@ tization ; image processing a field free of rain drops . use the selection tool to select the area , for example a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter regul@@ ator , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of the fil@@ tered filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirrors or turning into the right orientation . you can find the tools in the menu transform@@ ers or transform@@ ers . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to increase a photo with a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture to res@@ tra@@ der is simple . the big question is how you can get an image infl@@ atable and the details are sharp ? how can you find the missing information again ? how can you get the missing information again or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here , making it a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it on the desired size with the tool size . choose to change the size in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is to be seen below .
&quot; the tool to size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to enlarge the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ atable . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you must say the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are listed below :
&quot; aspect ratio : if this option is enabled , when entering the new dimension , the aspect ratio is the original image of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is we@@ en@@ ched . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
the buttons store as well as charging will be used exactly . each single line for photo can be saved as a text file and later be loaded again .
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast with what it makes , but it can still last very long and a high CPU load to move . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo infl@@ atable by a small shade on the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) . the original ( 2 ) is the result of the linear standard Aug@@ mentation to compare .
&quot; cutting a photos is not only a common operation procedure , but also a commonly underestimated tool to add a picture . image processing allows you to easily cut a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rec@@ tan@@ gle , you will see this rec@@ tan@@ gle during you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when you drop the mouse button again , the area of the photos cut off is cut off . by doing so , you can draw a good overview of your photo after the cutting area . you can create a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by clicking on the corners of the rec@@ tan@@ gle . you can simply drag a new rec@@ tan@@ gle by clicking on the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut@@ out , use the button &quot; &quot; button @-@ button &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file file save or file save in the menu file to save the newly added photo . &quot;
&quot; in the field of view , you can change the size of the rec@@ tan@@ gle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialog will remain . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as a high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high format , the larger value of the height and in the cross @-@ format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you use cen@@ tim@@ etres , ink or any other physical size . you can also see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to detect the selection automatically horizontal or ver@@ tically .
&quot; down in dialog you can set up with the Max . relation to the area for cutting on the greatest possible , depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio saves its settings depending on orientation ( horizontal or vertical ) . if you use the cutting @-@ cutting tool the next time , these settings are stored as default values into the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will be reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the setup assistant allow to show up help , so that you can put your images better together . these help are : &quot;
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmonious ponds are based on the principle of similarity . like the third @-@ party , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to divide a rec@@ tan@@ gle into similar harmon@@ ic triangles . &quot;
Golden Center : the golden middle is a split into various natural growth patterns like the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us Musch@@ el or the pet@@ als of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as nice .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1.@@ 6@@ 18@@ 0@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used in ancient Egyptians and Greeks , which thus used their temples and p@@ yrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 21 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . from where every number after 1 equal the sum of its two previous numbers is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . a composition that is usually follows as visual harmon@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
the golden middle will provide liquid assistance lines when you put a picture together . these help will be listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal for your photos . compared to the third party , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that leads to the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the observer along the line of the spiral and creates a symm@@ et@@ rical visual river . &quot;
&quot; another rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden rectangular corner . it should give something that the eye is at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . this can simply be there without the eye , it will fulfil its mission . &quot;
&quot; the Golden triangles are also guided from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral , and their ver@@ tex are the middle points of the side of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are no equ@@ ilater@@ al triangles . di@@ ag@@ onal to place these lines can have appeared a static object of dynam@@ ical triangles . &quot;
when you use golden triangles to break your frame create a effect of professional photographers dynamic symm@@ etry . try your portrait on one of the inter@@ sections and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach differently .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally mirror and vertical can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic parts .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the b@@ ail@@ line . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the utilities can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate a picture by any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , then it &apos;s easy to fix the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which the things turned around a corner . you can fix this by &amp; checking , image processing and tool free rotation . choose trans@@ figuration Free Rot@@ ation and j@@ us@@ ate the target angle . &quot;
rot@@ ate your picture with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are indicated in degrees . with the button pres@@ ets you can set the sli@@ der to 0 degree . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are shown on the right .
&quot; for your help , the module is available free rotation at a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor to position the two lines . after you fix it over an important point of the picture you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ate the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you filmed a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the picture is the function Autom@@ atically cutting . choose one of the following options :
&quot; the option of anti @-@ ali@@ asing is the image a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your image . the preview will then automatically be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialogue , you will find some information which help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle on top left : shows the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the top : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle at the bottom : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adapting the perspective , the image will be a little more spar@@ ed . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments create a double as strong effect and you should avoid it if possible . &quot;
after which you adapted the perspective you get in@@ joy@@ ous tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to hide this is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers out of the image processing .
&quot; the tool system is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the picture in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . a horizontal shot , the picture is distorted . in other words , a rec@@ tan@@ gle will be transformed into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module via transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ iss@@ ors your picture by using the horizontal angle and the vertical angle . you can press horizontal and vertical at the same time . if you press on preferences , the angle will be displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will display you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; to your help become a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , like e.g. the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool@@ ing tool to j@@ us@@ ate your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the shot , the image will be a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single mould this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two sh@@ ings generate twice as contrac@@ tion and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
after the shot the picture has un@@ pretty tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers out of the image processing .
&quot; currently there came a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats will depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries were comp@@ ili@@ ed . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats at this point . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF underneath . &quot;
&quot; checking it ; displays only files in formats of the list . if the extension is listed in the list . if the extension in the list is listed , the file will be displayed in image processing . you can change this list of file exten@@ tions the &amp; digi@@ tization . in the configuration you will find more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras can even allow you to select the user &apos;s use format . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . see both formats .
compression compression is the use of data compres@@ sing procedures in digital pictures . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced to save the images to an efficient way in this way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . in general there are better , smo@@ other results as JP@@ EG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also store losses if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to find out more about the rough format , you can read below Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous , and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can convert raw images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF by the Roh@@ poin@@ ter verter of &amp; digi@@ tization . in the configuration configuration you will find more information about the use of modules with &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; digi@@ tization came here ; support loading images only with the program d@@ cra@@ b , which was included in &amp; digi@@ tization . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw materials used by &amp; digi@@ tization . &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording short films . these clips are often stored in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ format ; however , these formats and will look for the movies . &amp; checking it ; however , if you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play films from movies to start playing the program for playback . &quot;

many tools you need to use the photo processing are included in &amp; digi@@ tization . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as har@@ ps , soft signs , smo@@ kes , re@@ vit@@ ational , re@@ focuss@@ ing , un@@ sharp , &amp; etc . . use a uniform dialogue type that is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture App@@ den@@ quot ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar displays the status of the filter on the current picture . links from him allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the thumb@@ field . these modes are :
ver@@ tically sharing without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area right of the selected area of the selected area .
horizontal divide without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper range displays the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
ver@@ tically divide . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal divide . the upper range displays the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nail , otherwise the original . &quot;
2 ) : there are two buttons which you can switch on to show over@@ - and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general display page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the preview . you can take this frame with the mouse within the image , and on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialogue will be updated immediately . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the lower left corner , here is one help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all inser@@ ts from the last use of the module are noted . &quot;
the side@@ bar features shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely in@@ explic@@ able . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photo . these data originates from EX@@ IF data when these are available .
this rider represents an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can stick with the mouse wheel or out zo@@ oming . press C@@ tr@@ l ; lin@@ ker mouse button to pull a square . all pictures inside this coordinates are fil@@ tered and indicated . of course this requires ahead of your pictures Ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; &amp; color@@ edit , is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and to choose and naming colors . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ allets files that are of &amp; k@@ de ; installed either for the whole system or just one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in a dialog palette , you can select from a list of the installed pal@@ ettes or search the folder to files . &quot;
cursor is displayed as a line . it can be moved by typ@@ ed on the area next to a color .
it shows on the color of the color . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose such a choice . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor up there . then move the mouse with an pressing mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field cac@@ m cursor under the button color is enabled , the color is inserted from the color plate at the cursor . the color is inserted either or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is over@@ written or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write was selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check@@ box over@@ write under Bei@@ m C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and Past@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; edit the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and an optional color name , followed by a poin@@ ter character , if another color is followed . if there are three num@@ eric values in the cli@@ p@@ board , they can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output selection can be drawn with the mouse .
&quot; select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the colour selection on the left side . &quot;
&quot; graphs are a K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graphs are free layout programs . graphs are used in science , especially in computer science . so far , there have been no modern &amp; GUI ; -@@ program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; graphic ; -@@ programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ graphic viewer : the project has set itself the goal of replacing these programs through a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is an K@@ DE program for viewing of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ ers . &amp; graphic viewer ; displays graphs with all possibilities of a well integrated &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of graphs in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph@@ ers re @-@ calculate and in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or to open the graphs in &amp; k@@ graphic ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; -@@ component to open
&quot; charging large graphs ( currently there are problems of about 1000 knot@@ s and a h@@ ack , to illustrate more than this knot@@ s ) &quot;
&quot; additional required software : &amp; k@@ graphi@@ cally ; is a &amp; k@@ ker ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for representing the graph . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window displays the opened graph , each in an own sub@@ window . at first , if you can launch a window , the main window is empty , as in the lower scre@@ enshot . in this case , the tool@@ bar only contains the symbol file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more &amp; dot ; files selected , the main window looks like in the lower scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the Grap@@ h is bigger than the string area . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special , left and right of pressing &amp; Alt ; key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the Grap@@ h should be re@@ charged or if you want to ignore the change . &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; your decision can also be noted , so later will be used . if you want to change your decision later , you can use the menu item Settings viewer : use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you want to open a graph@@ ite off outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; an instance , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer ; an instance , or want to display the graphs in a sub@@ window of the already ongoing instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session again . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be split into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to come to a page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page shows with one on several pages distributed graphs without head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the site again lets the possibility to set the behavior if a file changes to the hard disk , and eg ; from another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program for each time . &quot;
&quot; the page opening gives the opportunity to set the behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; if a graph is opened outside an ongoing session . you can open a standard behavior for that case ( the graphs in a new window open or set in a sub@@ window of already current session ) , or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
the page management site gives the possibility to determine the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphic viewer ; you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at any start then .
&quot; the context menu , which is usually at a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , opens up more possibilities : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphic ; -@@ layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; red &amp; dot ; -@@ algorithm , the standard for targeted graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered representations of directed graphs . the algorithm lays the edges into the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then tries to produce as short edges and as few pit@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for invalid graphs . it uses depic@@ tions under the spring@@ board model . thereby , the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm uses , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model layout . it uses the Fru@@ its @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istik , and includes a multi @-@ mo@@ ver for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm forms the k@@ not circular , according to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ stri@@ k@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; then open a dialog in which you can specify an layout command , then accepting a shell script , and the calculated layout of the graph after st@@ d@@ out in the x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can modify &amp; eg ; the &amp; graphi@@ cally ; -@@ algorithms special options , or even the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
determines the type of the graph ( judged or invalid ) and uses the standard algorithms for each type ( dot ; for targeted , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for invalid graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed as if necessary . otherwise , it is not displayed and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
shows the What is the mouse cursor . click with this poin@@ ter to a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this element ( if available ) .
a list of changes is available under this address and in the file Ch@@ angel@@ og in the base folder of the source code .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a &amp; k@@ ish ; -@@ program that uses the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tools to display . it requires the following programs :
a special arrangement is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ graphic ; to use . in the menu settings you will find further options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five areas : the main tool@@ bar , the bar tool@@ bar , the status bar , the .@@ color palette , and the casting net , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; created a new symbol . if the current file has been changed , you will ask if you want to save the changes . afterwards , a dialog where you can choose whether the symbol is to be created from a template , or whether you want to start anew . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken a step back again . if you do not have a step back , this function is disabled . &quot;
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey tones . this can create colors that do not agree with those of the icon range of &amp; k@@ de ; match .
&quot; does not change the icon , but sets the current character color on the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the current promotions . from left to right , it shows you the X@@ - and y coordinates of the current Pix@@ els , the size of the current string , the magni@@ fying factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board as a new image ( if the cli@@ p@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up dialogue with the three pages Templ@@ ates for symbols , background and symbols . &quot;

&quot; select Transpar@@ ent Pixel or insert Lin@@ e@@ ale : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transpar@@ ence indication . you can also set the size : the car@@ os on small , means and wholesale , as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module images are provided tools to add new pictures and detect them .
this module can be used to read and detect new pictures from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images scan : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports through the SA@@ NE project or another source like e.g. video streams . so this works you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE installed .
&quot; when you scan the menu entry images , a dialog that you can select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to pick up the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears as you can replace the default values duc@@ r@@ he in order to select your image according to the button scanning . the cher@@ ished file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
note that the window will be displayed completely because some settings may not be displayed .
&quot; after you have pressed the button scanning , you have to wait until the scan is complete and the window to specify the options of the target image . here you can also select the compression and type of image file . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image stored by the image . &quot;
screen photos can you generate after you have selected in the menu import@@ ing &gt; scre@@ enshot ... a window appears in which you can set the different screen photo@@ sets :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all its own program window is selected , the call program will disappear , so you can see other screens and windows . otherwise , you will be reading after a short delay , the currently visible workplace . if you choose the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
the delay determines how long scre@@ enshot is waiting before it starts . if you need to switch to other desktop surfaces you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there .
&quot; once the scre@@ enshot of the scre@@ enshot was made , the dialog options for the target image with the options described above . &quot;

&quot; Flickr is an online photo broad@@ casting on the Internet . with Flickr it is possible to send his photos to the people who are important . you can show your favourite photos of the world , show the photos of your cam@@ ah@@ and@@ ys online and show your photos safely and privately to your friends and family around the world . &quot;
the module expor@@ ters to Flickr can be used to upload pictures from your computer to a Flickr server on the Internet .
&quot; when you use the module for the first time , you will be using the process of generating a Token System . so it is used for your authentication . a browser is started so that you can register with Flickr . &quot;
&quot; after the successful registration , the module can send photos to the Flickr website . the following page will be presented after a successful registration . &quot;
simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pushed to Yes you will get the dialog to upload photos to Flickr . this will be displayed in the next section .
&quot; if the module exports to Flickr for two @-@ two times , you will be welcomed with the following dialogue , which indicates the current access per@@ missions to the module , then you need write messages . the module currently supports no other per@@ missions . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button photos should be pushed once , after you have set all the other options . with this button you can select the photos you want to upload . if you press on the O@@ k button , the up@@ loading of the photos to Flickr server . &quot;
the keywords field can be filled with one through a comm@@ a separate list of words . these are added to the image as a tags during the up@@ loading .
&quot; with the options openings , friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as a Private . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the option to select the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading will be changed in size . the size is taken from the value of the maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to set the maximum height of images . the size is so modified the aspect ratio remains constant .

the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographical loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of an image and edit . the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF sampling of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alization provides tools to locate pictures ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spherical coordination system , used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data you need a GPS track as XML @-@ file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ tro@@ mat@@ . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data to you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alisation cor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu to guide . of course , to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data from the same time at the same places as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file loaded , a automatic correlation is carried out the coordinates in red . GPS trace data is recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera data can be calculated with the GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; the option for maximum time devi@@ ation gives a high devi@@ ation for the GPS time and cam@@ per@@ ation . if the devi@@ ation , including the data , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have any trace data from one place for pictures you can edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add to the pictures . the difference between 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related all the images in this field .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and differential in min. can be used if you do not have matching data . if you know that in reality a location between camera and GPS is , you can put these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be manually set manually using this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . as the dialog will use the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and made available with the displayed map and enlarge it . select the relevant region and enlarge it again and again , the map must always be selected manually . the map can be switched between map mode , satellite screen and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to hang on the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script used that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums as HTML pages , and select the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will allow UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be adjusted . the rider selection allows all of the albums to select to HTML . you will need to select these albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly appear a large number of albums . in the field below , you will see the list and the text that appear in the header of the HTML page . &quot;
the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely in@@ explic@@ able . the option for each image is created to create a page where the image is displayed . otherwise the picture is displayed directly with your standard imaging , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show . &quot;
&quot; the tab album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . simply select a folder on which you write writing . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ on Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF data of your original pictures will also be stored in the new pictures too . &quot;
&quot; with other color deep , you can change the default color deep . of course , the file size also influences the file size . all other settings are in@@ explic@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to customize some of the settings from the album tab for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images to be displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; when the module has created the pages the window will not be closed automatically . you can therefore read the program@@ m@@ ations automatically , in order to determine whether error occurred during production . the web browser is automatically started to preview the preview of the gallery . press Close to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I imaging is a very fast and flexible OpenGL tool to look at pictures .
&quot; the IP@@ O sculptor allows Ih@@ m@@ ene to view a selection of pictures and use them base operations such as la@@ wns , zo@@ oming or reloc@@ ating . it is easy to use with short @-@ use and mouse clicks . it has been developed for a quick recovery and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after starting , a picture is displayed in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions below to store images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ ure free storage is it which increases the file size , since no compres@@ sing of the color formations occurs . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that allows you to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing it , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ . attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;

&quot; with the import @-@ function of the met@@ adata , you can copy data from an image to another . then select the file dialog with which you want to copy the target image , so the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you pushed to the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not in any target format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please check ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ ers module can be used to convert selected images into an MPEG video , with a defined length , to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a basic imaging . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV of the Di@@ asch@@ au . &quot;
all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the chosen video format . in addition you can create a background color for the slides . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
first you must first select the pictures that are packed into the MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au . after that you can launch the module via Ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ asch@@ au .
&quot; the images selected by you are then listed under picture files in the portfolio . there , you can also change sor@@ ting of the pictures or the content of the list . &quot;
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should customize the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , CD CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should indicate the time in seconds the image is indicated below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them be black . the name and path of the generated file you can set up under the name of the MPEG output file . keep in mind as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio file , then it will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your machine you can start drinking a coffee with the button enco@@ ding , and enjoy the slides , if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that Ko@@ di@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck packages across the button settings on the right below . &quot;
the print super@@ visor allows you to print several pictures on a piece of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . this can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gimp . this is e.g. recommended to print you or use the Gimp module to print a direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images stored in the RA@@ W format in one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original county from Him is : do not expect the same results produced as the software from your camera producer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ w better results !
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w ima@@ verter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now re@@ configure the values re@@ vert to the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings for the whit@@ eboard should be used . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the picture later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected , so that you can use the contrac@@ tion information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
once you are satisfied with the preview you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conver@@ sions . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes .
the tagged image format , TI@@ FF , retains all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your pictures frequently or later on , you should not select the JP@@ EG format , since it is only a limited number of operations allowed before the image quality is worse . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
if you choose JP@@ EG as storage format the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the EX@@ IF file in the EX@@ IF data file .
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start using the conversion button . if you want to break this process again , you can do so . &quot;
&quot; the st@@ acker processing mode allows you to convert various images at once . use this mode , so if you are safe , e.g. by testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the settings available are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , this is helpful if it has been created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to convert all pictures in one album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following picture formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ aming all images of one album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start and the time p@@ unch of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to modify the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can make the image smaller or enlarge . these are made available to four types of picture change :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , selected . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; print preparation : prepare the image for the photo pressure . the user can adjust the printing solution and the size of the phot@@ op@@ ap@@ iers . the target image , including background size , size and background color , is adapted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your favorite e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images before . further pictures can be drawn to the list of the down@@ stream images and take it there .
&quot; after you started the module , the photos window will be displayed with the images you pre @-@ selected images . you can add more pictures above the button pictures . for the last chosen image , a preview image will be displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and add it to the list of the images below .
with the button pictures you will remove the selected images from the list of the added images .
&quot; once you have selected all the pictures , you can open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client with the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the images you selected are already attached as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of the sen@@ ti@@ tes E @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send lots of pictures .
the email window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and time again until you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you choose Thunder@@ bird , you need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; following the choice of comments in a attached file , the comments on the pictures are put together into a text file and attached the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adjusted among loss of free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast Internet connection and the photo quality is not changed . otherwise we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
if you choose JP@@ EG under pictures of file format and the original files in JP@@ EG format are then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the sen@@ ti@@ tes pictures .
&quot; if the process is ready , the window will not automatically closed the status messages , in search of errors , look at . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . with the button Connect you can narrow this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced ski@@ ppers , a window with questions like you want to have shown your slides . you can choose between the pictures selected and all pictures of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option OpenGL transi@@ tions in the presentation are enabled very elegant cap@@ tions by means of OpenGL . however , you need to have a corresponding graphics card , as otherwise the di@@ asch@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the fil@@ en@@ ame option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of images will be shown in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can manually break down manually with Es@@ c .
&quot; the option to choose images random@@ ly ensures that the pictures are shown in a random order . so , it will not be the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
&quot; under delay between the images , the temporary distance between the individual images can be set 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and your chosen transition effect . so you should show this before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen transi@@ tions between which you can choose . random@@ ly chooses a different effect on each transition between the pictures .
&quot; during the slides , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to turn you on . &quot;
&quot; using this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; at the left bottom of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date j@@ us@@ tic@@ us currently has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team at k@@ de @-@ Imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. respect : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub @-@ menu , as the background for your K@@ DE work@@ surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . through this browser , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image , are now available in each group , so in people , places and in group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you see the categories , for which you have entered information when you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to look at the EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse on the entry individuals , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
if you choose another person only the images are shown on which both individuals are visible . through this selection method you can restrict the number of images shown by a few thousand images to a few single images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view the thumb@@ nails , to view the pictures of your efficiency area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol in front of their name . you can save with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . however , for each person a private image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories which you have defined themselves . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button that you want to use on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . please note that you can view the view for each category separately ( if you do not have a list of keywords ) for example ( if you do not have a list of keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must also specify which image for each individual person shall appear . to do this , you need to display the image application window ( in closer described ) and select in the context menu , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and thus select which part of the image is to be displayed and cut . &quot;
&quot; when you access the main window entry , a dialog will display you with the dialog for the festive of the image properties very similar . this dialogue can be seen on the picture once again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string into the field cap@@ tion or description , the cap@@ ri@@ gs and descriptions of the pictures will be brow@@ sed . if you wish , you can also use a date , for example in 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures after certain name as you can see in the picture . here , after pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but rather try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; glue album , and take a look at the fast @-@ entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; paste the demo album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , for the first time , or select in the menu help the menu entry on photo@@ album . then , some sample pictures are loaded and you can test the functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as a coher@@ ent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar shows you here : . as the name suggests , this bar shows you date statistics on the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time@@ pieces . each track then shows a different unit . you can switch between the units of years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by pointing the bar just 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be used on the following ways : you can preview the indicated entries from the database ( if you choose a date , the first image of this date is displayed in the preview image ) , and the tim@@ eline shows the current date of the currently shown pictures when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a section of the tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button and select the mouse over the lin@@ e@@ al of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information , you will be displayed in the preview View only pictures of this period . you can cancel the selection by clicking on a beam of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album , provides you with two ways to create HTML @-@ websites with your images . the one is available in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , the one is described in &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you can create files using the menu File HTML ... &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages you will need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas content , layout and finish . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the sho@@ cks and a description which the HTML file should be included later . on the photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example pages you can see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album is created ; export file will be created on the overview page . nutritional information about the export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . for example , you can avoid that information is displayed without a description . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , that all pictures are exported from a party . for example , you can not use this attitude to hide certain pictures from certain points . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can specify how the HTML @-@ pages should look like . most settings are obvious , why not specifically respond to this . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions on the pictures . by doing so , those who are viewing your website and have a monitor that supports maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no images to download , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the spect@@ ator of your site may change the resolution at any time you have set . so he can browse your pictures with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if he wants to display a picture larger than it changes to higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; at best , select a basic folder for all your HTML files and for each subsequent sentence , a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you must select the main folder in which all your pictures are stored . this folder is saved and will be automatically selected for all future pictures . here you can choose a folder or one of K@@ DE support protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if these really are all for viewer visible . if you have created for the basic folder , a web browser after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser should start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them into the final destination folder . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders are placed . &quot;
&quot; the settings described above have all three on base folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re sitting on a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , you might want to share your pictures with these images . you can naturally add a HTML page to viewing the images . however , you need to add a HTML page to the images , recording location , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ in file . you can import it into your database . image properties are used with ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to pictures . the advantage is to save all the pictures in the file and pass this file independently . the obvious downside is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can edit a .@@ k@@ im file directly from the File File menu ... or together with HTML @-@ sites , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is looking for the pictures in a double way . first , the images are not found in the folder file . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML @-@ export file . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for exporting pictures is described , which can be accessed through the File menu . &quot;
the main option of this dialogue is whether it is about internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three choices :
&quot; to copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the images in the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atically copied into the .@@ k@@ im file , copied &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures automatically for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip file . since most pictures have been compressed with JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files . if you like this , just choose the option export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might want to load the pictures otherwise very big . here you can limit the size by using for example , that each image should be most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Import ... select , will be downloaded &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for import@@ ing consists of four steps . first , you must select which pictures you want to import , then in which folder the import images are to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can person@@ alize the category People of the imported file . therefore , when this category is called for your database people . therefore , in the third dialogue window , you are supposed to be imported in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file are to be imported and which categories will match it in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can select the categories of the imported file using the categories of your current database . an example of this can be seen on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to search and watch images : if you look at pictures , you often want to view images of your Italy @-@ holiday and discover a picture with your friend to discover , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will go through the various steps ( 1 ) Fest@@ ing the information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) the search and prestige , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ album has been started as a program for car@@ et@@ akers of your pictures . however , it has been extended and today there is also your videos . in many places in this manual is spoken about pictures , but frequently they also closes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; for all its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal hed@@ x , copy to a dis@@ kette or revisions in CVS . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; notice the folder in which your pictures are stored and uses it at future start automatically . if you want to start another folder in &amp; on photo@@ album . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / ima@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; set up the menu settings on photo@@ album , set up ... get to a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user manual , you will be explained the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the settings options of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each adjustment you can access the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described in you how to create different properties for each image , e.g. persons , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; by view the dialog , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group you can select a let@@ tering and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section , sub@@ categories were already mentioned . in the dialog options you can set up complete members , i.e. all members of a group at once in a group rather than explained all groups of an intermedi@@ ary as described in . &quot;
&quot; in view of the settings options available to you to the celebration of the member groups . with the above listed list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left panel there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications such as checking K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; image Plugin Interface . nutritional information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be called over the menu modules . the modules can and will not be described in this manual since they are not part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . however , most modules have a help page that you can call through the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules of multiple applications are shared among each other , it may be that the modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album were used . therefore , you should either test new modules first with the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or through the menu help . say not , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications , which use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I , are very different , whereby it may be that some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album are not working . this is the downside if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; glue album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; this simul@@ ates &amp; glue album ; the current album that is simply the current view , i.e. all pictures that shows you the picture show at the moment . &quot;
&quot; besides the current album , you have to pass on photo@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also has a list of albums . here goes &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category is an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have defined in the settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , for example , use the category people , will have chosen &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , so if you have chosen people to view it and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the settings dialog , and select in the area modules which are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a starting screen , once you &apos;re playing &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the top of a menu and tool@@ bar . currently , it does not contain very much information as you can &apos;t see any information about your pictures . in the section we will see you posted on this window , now please click on the entry images to show you an overview of all available pictures . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album is the possibility to see each picture with notes , where the picture was taken on . you can use any image either individually or for a larger number of pictures certain notes at the same time . if for example , on all pictures of Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all the pictures in Copenhagen have been added . &quot;
&quot; all of these notes can be used for searching and browsing as you can read in the section . if you want you can see these notes , if you want to use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; in view three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use it again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea lies the moving image within the list : if you are depicted for example a family party and in all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons are depicted , so you can find that the names used up upwards are to be found faster and assign . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting to date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen remarks for each image separately , you may need to edit all selected images and add these images to notes . simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be convenient to highlight all these images and use the menu item of multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . besides , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you see a browser window that indicates the USA as a over @-@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the review , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a category and put it there to make this one sub@@ category of this entry . please note that you just sort your categories alphabe@@ tically . see it . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the attribute , by clicking the gro@@ in which form the edge of the frame , click and move . you can also make a separate window by drawing it out of the window section . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the appearance of the window so to your needs , click on the button Options ... , which gives you the possibility to save the current setup and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also let a frame complete . if you want to see this window later , use the button Options ... and then window will pop up a / fade away . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you show the entry images in the browser , you will get an overview with thumb@@ nails of the currently selected images , or all images in case you do not have a filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply drag the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; when you get an image on the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this will be displayed in the picture concerned . if you have not yet opened a window with an image asset , a new display window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete images in the image show . simply select the appropriate pictures you want to delete , or select either the removing button or select the Edit menu . now you can see the window you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; for this problem you can use a solution . you can also use this problem . of course , you can also use the pictures somewhere , so that &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; pictures in which the right upper corner is cut off , are not stored on hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the thumb@@ nails are available , such as &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . you can also view these images with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this function you need to copy files from folders and re@@ copy it again . so , if you do not want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the corresponding CD . if you want to avoid the mess of your images , please buy a larger disk in order to save all the images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will want to have a sub@@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , you want to leave the pictures so that at the end of those you want to see for others in@@ accessible , con@@ ta@@ xed and select the menu item all except current view . &quot;
&quot; so you have set what pictures should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , giving all the pictures you want to get hidden . if you want to see the pictures again , click on Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which has to be inserted to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select a password in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; remember that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on the one hand , all images can be accessed from the hard disk and on the other , anyone who can refer to the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml , which is not very familiar to those who are equipped with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to spend all of your pictures with &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album , of course , manage and spend hours over hours , of course , that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason &amp; glue album . for this reason &amp; glue album . this you can start from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer can be seen in the viewer . of course , it shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is located on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag them to the mouse . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are displayed after a right @-@ click on the viewer . then you can see a list menu . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser , see the right entries to this display . so if you click Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you have chosen people from your browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them and use the buttons below . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as di@@ asch@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , then loads a new image after a couple of seconds . how often it can be checked for a new picture by clicking the Str@@ g button and plus or minus . now , the slides through the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
&quot; a very useful ability of the viewer of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album . in this mode it is used in full screen mode . in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch into full @-@ screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can easily drag in the image and pull out a rec@@ ycle . with the Min@@ us button , you can simply drag the Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rec@@ tan@@ gle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ oms . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom so that the image will not be zo@@ omed , with the equ@@ est@@ est continues the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel corresponds to the screen of a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ oper@@ ations work in the videos that are in and found out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and App@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; with the torque functions from the context menu , you can turn the image . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current picture with the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the picture . in the moment you can view the view and configur@@ ing dialog of the image to insert this name . however , you will perhaps prefer to mark the image and see more pictures . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer . to see which photos you want to start the viewer with the images and select them as good or bad , while you see one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above there are the viewer to add pictures with characteristics , while you view them . characteristics are the letters A to Z and you can put a feature by clicking the corresponding letters . see an image where the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features on your pictures , they are available to you in the browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you just want to do . &quot;
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ nail . if you view categories in D@@ re thumb@@ nail then you can simply add features to the images by simply clicking the letters for the characteristic once the picture was chosen . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; on the picture to paint .
&quot; the mixture is not saved with the image , but in the database . in the way you can re@@ vert your painted later . &quot;
in you can see an image on the painted image . to turn on the painting mode of &amp; photo@@ photo@@ album ; add on the image painting from the context menu . to end the table simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar on top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; work to work , you need to control the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely control but the documentation on &amp; Pov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select individual objects . then , their properties are displayed in the properties tab and the object in the wire models are yellow represented . &quot;
you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object of a already selected object since all sub@@ objects are already chosen with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position on which you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu inser@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following folding @-@ up menu appears , so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu , you can remove selected objects from the scene before . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click to apply these changes . do you have invalid values , a message is displayed with a error description . then you can click the input errors and re @-@ use the changes with cras@@ hing . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the furnishings dialog , you can enter the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the given object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 contains already the user &apos;s documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the originality view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ View section and a small example of the scene is thrown with the chosen texture , even if you want to select a sub@@ ordin@@ ated element ( for example , a texture inside a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , you cross it locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points to the mouse and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the check@@ points will disappear and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through pulling with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a visual @-@ wire model . you can indicate this value relatively to the level of visibility of the higher object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their visual @-@ level of visual or equal value in the tool@@ bar of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a shut@@ ters as default . the object tree and the view of the properties tab are shown on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you do not like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust them as you like . you can also save several shut@@ ters and switch between different directions . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under one point of view , drag the beginning to the top or bottom of a view . a rec@@ tan@@ gle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beginning to the right or left side of a view . the new view is anchored on the right hand side or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views on each other , drag the beginning to another view . you can then change between the views by clicking on the car@@ p @-@ card in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible shut@@ ters are floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to remove a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the beginning to the desktop or click on the little to the left top arrow in the box . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent the left , click on the small square between dart and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are sh@@ ame@@ ful , you can anchor them at any point . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can save you with view window frames ... save it . it will be displayed a dialog , where you can save the shut@@ ters under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can ren@@ ders them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g to rendering , this program must be properly installed . as this manual is written , &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 @-@ date . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ ders the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view scene . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ ender mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various images and quality levels , you can insert as many re@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in the tool@@ bar or in the menu View Samples , the following dialogue will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can enter any name , but a name that lets the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the cardboard card size you can enter the width and height of the plug@@ ged image . if you just want a small area of the picture , select the cross @-@ section sub@@ section and enter the picture @-@ section to enter into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field quality , you can select the properties that are &amp; Pov@@ ray . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflections . a detailed description of the re@@ ender features can be found in the user manual and Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is minim@@ ized with just one beam , there are different errors . these images often have a fashion effects in curves and lines and sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray : uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this error . generally , pictures with this feature are better . &quot;
if you turn on anti @-@ ali@@ asing and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called great sampling .
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; re@@ cur@@ ly because the second method is adap@@ tive @-@ recur@@ sively ; recur@@ sively , because every pixel continues to be further divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ ve loop depends on the calculated colors . &quot;
&quot; when you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray pursu@@ es a beam of pixels . if you set the difference between h@@ ues to the neighboring pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the lowering value on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be charged with a lowering of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays depending on the pixels . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixel . if the difference between the colour values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels and the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be checked with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise on the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changes &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for the quality of the ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; , the diff@@ use light reflection . it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property . &quot;
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the Alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the beams have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for viewing the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; Con@@ sol@@ ation issue . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray ; select the menu item Connec@@ ting ... and choose a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supported &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete commands of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if in the import@@ ing error messages or warnings , a dialogue window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source text in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; import this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . to import objects into the scene , just highlight the code in the editor and drag it to the item tree . &quot;
&quot; with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can insert source text for &amp; Pov@@ ray , as well . &quot;
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; one scene ren@@ ders this . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the help in the property view , opens &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . enter the path to your document and the version . currently , the versions are 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; Pov@@ ray : search for external files ( for example high alti@@ fel@@ ines ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not found in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the chosen check@@ points .
the color of the rec@@ tan@@ gle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window type con@@ marks .
&quot; you can adjust the object of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set up the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rot@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; greater values result in a more precise wire model and thus a better nails for the displayed objects , but require more time to rendering . for some objects such as the ball , you can adjust the level of details for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the high level of detail for advanced proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are further divided , when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections using the perspective and the incre@@ mental proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you show wall a wall behind the objects , a wall is thrown behind the objects . the wall is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you show ground , a ground is thrown below the objects . the ground is represented in a box pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate Kan@@ ten@@ gl@@ it@@ ure , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . the values for depth and swelling can you adjust . more precise information about the parameters can be found in section R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing shut@@ ters or create new shut@@ ters . in the section shut@@ ters will be explained how you can create and save shut@@ ters . &quot;
the drop @-@ box standard cover order : displays all existing shut@@ ters . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the selected window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of available shut@@ ters displays all existing shut@@ ters . a new arrangement , you can create with the button Add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button removal . &quot;
every window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly and must not be empty .
&quot; the list under the name indicates all views of the chosen window order . new views can be created with the button Add , and delete selected views with the button removing . &quot;
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column you will create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with un@@ locking the window under the existing window , with car@@ p card , the view does not appear in the main window , but creates a seper@@ ate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have just installed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and now you would like to begin with more detailed knowledge of the two programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene with beginners : one bul@@ let at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully note the following warnings , before you complain that you as a result can only use a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you add no light sources , your whole scene is in the dark , and you get only a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ lessly , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following set @-@ up windows : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation , so you can expect an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu item Edit delete . so you have a scene without objects . &quot;
&quot; the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular , you notice the scene from the camera point of view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the ren@@ der@@ ns of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the View properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved later instructions , but note that the camera can change in the view check@@ points . simply click with the left mouse button on a check point and drag it to the desired place . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or press the edit button , the wire model views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . you could fit for example a Qu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting end@@ ental body Qu@@ ader ) and the size on x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a viable method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; actually offers a easier way . you can use an infinite level as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the button or insert the button bar . in the object tree the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire model also displays the plane as well , even at the moment only as a limited level . if you ren@@ ders the scene , the level extends to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree , you will find that you can click on the item + in front of the object . in this case , you &apos;ll find only the standard options for each new object : scal@@ ding , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the view of the properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizon line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as below : &quot;
&quot; first , select the ground to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog will open in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the property view ( name = floor pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment now looks like . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of pig@@ ments only displays a rough black material , because you need to enter settings for pig@@ ment . therefore , you always remember that you can preview the appearance of materials anytime with a click on preview . also , there are many options now , but now take the easiest way . &quot;
&quot; if you do not preview any color on Qu@@ ader and ball , then click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you want your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , that is not the color that you have expected . here are additional settings necessary . in the color list you need to enter two new attributes . then you can edit this entry twice ( you can do this also frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
choose in the object tree every@@ time and change the colors in the view of the properties tab :
&quot; this step you should already perform , as you should have understood the basic functioning of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood just as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in view of the properties tab , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button apply ) , so the ball would float above the ground as you postponed the ground to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now yields a strange result : as before , the ball surface appears like a black @-@ black material . set in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; when you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as already with the floor , let the ball give a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first @-@ object and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . click on balls pig@@ ment , select then einf@@ ar@@ big and make the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values like in the following screen photos and click on the input button .
&quot; the settings shine and reflection shows some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if met@@ allic : still not selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler . hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can easily create , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a re@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; if you have a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera , the scenes ) are reflected by the objects and how this beam will affect the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can affect weight . thus , the scene pixels is processed for pixels . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will without a camera see nothing , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene , which is to be allevi@@ ated , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in common file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have the file expansion * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file is inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it is stored under the same name . if there is a new file , you must enter a name and space . &quot;
&quot; once again , the scene has been re @-@ recorded in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage are being rejected . &quot;
&quot; you can only select this menu item , if you have not yet stored any changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeated the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used editing . &quot;
&quot; store the current shut@@ ters and opens a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new order , or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you can find options for the setting of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; , here you can change the look , the keyboard short@@ cut and the standard behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the short@@ cut abbrevi@@ ation . you can change or add new sub@@ commands with this option to change the short@@ cuts for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands .
opens up a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove the option of tool@@ kit for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; -@@ commands .
&quot; a B@@ ump map is a way to pre@@ fix the finishes , without any b@@ ump on the surface individually , and without changing the geomet@@ rical form of the object itself . &quot;
it is custom@@ ary to use the same file for a batch map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic body are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens of dozens , or even hundreds of this basic body . these models are then further edited to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , by using a image file as color card . &quot;
&amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a convenient image asset and browser . the application has a file browser where you can select images to display .
images can be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or press return .
&quot; you can set whether any picture is to be displayed in an own window , or if all images are supposed to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the right bottom corner . if a pass@@ able fil@@ en@@ ame appears , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing returns or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialog inser@@ ting - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five car@@ p cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; B @-@ commands for the display window and du@@ mb@@ bell for the browser , you can set the short@@ cut abbrevi@@ ation for the respective windows . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the pictures are open in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad is filled with the background color that you can continue to adjust below . default is not a full @-@ screen mode . &quot;
&quot; is this point activated , invites &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you still look at the current picture . this reduces the delay if you choose the next picture , and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when visiting the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the coloured bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , also here the background is filled with the selected colour . &quot;
&quot; you can &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so that only a few of the file types will be displayed , which can also display the program . &quot;
this option is used for large pictures to display the display window on the full screen . this option is switched as default .
determine if the slideshow is to start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image change at a slideshow . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the sli@@ der or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of re@@ ps is set to 0 , the slideshow is repeated until it is cancelled due to the user . to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows on the right side next to the input field . the default setting is 1 . &quot;
change the keyboard short@@ cut for the different modes of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; in the car@@ n@@ cards short @-@ command for the display window and du@@ mb@@ bell for the browser .
&quot; with this option , you switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short description .
displays small symbols for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short description .
displays the thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is possible only in the short description .

&quot; as the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ cas@@ ing ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to contribute to its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ cas@@ ing is as easy as possible errors or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides an entry of reports or wishes . this displays a dialog with a link . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to give your message . &quot;
&quot; show@@ cas@@ ing : is a project that is supported by a community . that is , that users and developers can help each other . if you want to answer some other users of &amp; show@@ cas@@ ing . in this mailing list , however , we would like to answer some other users from the show@@ cas@@ ing . in this mailing list , however , you should be able to be powerful . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in the show@@ cas@@ ing ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ cas@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the show@@ cas@@ ed ; tries to give you so much control over your work@@ flow as possible . there are many options to change the behavior of &amp; show@@ cas@@ ing . to set up these settings , you need to switch to the menu settings . you can switch between them by clicking on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the sub@@ - or over@@ exposed inde@@ xed indicator should display the colors with what you are supposed to display in contrast . under@@ exposure should display bright color and over@@ exposure to a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show@@ piece , has a side@@ bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and promotions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar can also be found in the image processing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five horse@@ men : &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , is an application to scan images which no longer makes images to scan and fl@@ atter@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an easy application to scan images that can no longer sell as images to scan and retrieve the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images in front of the file . &quot;
you can check the status of support your scanner on the SA@@ NE project by entering the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ G@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ p@@ l .
a standard scanner can be set at the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; using the command sk@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not open or if no standard scanner is specified then a dialog to select the scanner is open .
&quot; the user can select the scanner , select and OK to open the scanner . cancel , cancel or sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite . &quot;
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) covers these options not particularly .
&quot; to add an image , the user can only start a pre @-@ cho@@ p and then start scanning for the final scan . the Vor@@ sch@@ can is started by the preview button . &quot;
to make the picture better select the user into the image and from the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the zoom so that the complete preview in the window fits .
&quot; when the image is selected , the final picture can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when before saving a preview display in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a subur@@ b window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and s@@ lie ? s leads to a break and get back into the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the button settings , the hom@@ onymous dialog is open before the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images saves . dialog to save for each image opens the dialog in a previously defined folder . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , this automatically opens with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must save save without a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the pictures can be saved on the Option without after a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the pictures are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as standard for dialog to store . the default value is your home directory , and you can change this with the button ... change . &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically to be mem@@ orized images and is also the proposed name for the image in dialog to store . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical sou@@ ff@@ ix of each time , if an image is stored . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save . this value also changes the compression value by saving . if Cho@@ ose the image quality is not selected , then the default value is used by Q@@ t . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE About @-@ dialog for &amp; sk@@ an@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; below you can set up a list of this p@@ itations and their function . below you can set up a list of this p@@ ump@@ kin and its function . the global keyboard short@@ cut can set up , by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window and set the short commands ... choose . &quot;
you may possibly set existing multimedia keys so that it works as a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; they make your keyboard on a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ COP interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions which mostly can be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and should describe the D@@ COP functions of Collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . such as : &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ok supports the command @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition , Amar@@ ok has some own command @-@ lines options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script can not be executed on account of a missing dependence . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and take advantage of dialog , so that the user know why a script is not running . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ bin@@ dings v@@ 3.4 is for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the folder Scrip@@ ts / templates , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ o@@ ok and Amar@@ o@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the command &apos;s d@@ co@@ p ; which each K@@ DE installation should be included . &quot;
most scripts allow the trigger of external programs and commands . in this way the function ex@@ ec is used . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be viewed relatively easy . here &apos;s an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all the current scripts . for this reason , strings on the default version of the scripts is written . for this reason scripts should be monitored continuously and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can also ignore the events if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure We@@ is the script to display the furnishings dialog . to store and load the furnishings data , each script needs to take care of each script . if a script will be started , Amar@@ o@@ ok the working folder on the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ aled that a new piece will be played . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the pieces ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume sign@@ alized a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ er@@ cli@@ ffy : sub@@ menu navigation on the path to the selected files of the playlist , if a user @-@ defined menu item can be clicked on . to add an entry again , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script remo@@ ve@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or if the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to work for example the storing of data or configuration settings . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script management can also install script packages that can download the user &amp; eg ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ tar ) which can also be detected with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ Archive ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) that the user can see the archive clearly as a Amar@@ o@@ script package .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sion script . for this reason , you should nom@@ inate your script packages right away . &quot;
the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) to the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter to obtain the file rights :
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can click on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and the link to the Wi@@ ki scripts page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . to your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; Skri@@ ll . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful functions and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist rather than you need to work through endless menus . maybe you are also looking for a very specific title out of thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s gathering browser and the quick search , you will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult to select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to specific criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used so that you can listen to your music . Amar@@ o@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to enter into the basic folder of Amar@@ o@@ e@@ springs to compile and install Amar@@ ok and install : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf@@ ers and autom@@ aker used , you should have no difficulty in the compile . if you encounter problems , please tell them in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; and Amar@@ o@@ ok , like most applications , has some options to enable or disable the comp@@ iling point using the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain depen@@ dencies need to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort on the furnishings dialog . the furnishings dialog has several mapping cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; player window displays the player @-@ window in addition to the playlist / or from . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists are mentioned window ) . &quot;
mood bar@@ ometer : this function is only available when &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar is compiled . the option ref@@ uses the experimental function of the voting provider .
&quot; tuning full shape : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , the color scheme for m@@ ood@@ bar@@ ometer is changed . &quot;
&quot; voting files at the music files : this function is only available , if &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . otherwise , the .@@ com@@ b files in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; stored ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / etc / m@@ ood@@ bar / etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; external browser : let you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will be started when a browser is needed . &quot;
&quot; other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser , which is not listed in the list . &quot;
&quot; playlist that you save , the current playlist automatically saves the end of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; activate this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist when you don &apos;t want to lose . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , you will use these settings ; relative paths to the music files , from the location of the playlist , use it . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; up @-@ to @-@ date piece appear to be visible in the piece of change , that the play@@ lists window show up / drop in order to keep the current piece always in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when you switch to the context of the context , you automatically switch to the context browser when the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the appearance of appearance , you can customize &amp; Amar@@ ok . the section is divided into three parts sub@@ section . &quot;
&quot; in the fonts section you can use the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok . you can select fonts for the following range : playlist window , player windows and context browser . press to select ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have yourself the tor@@ ment of choice and can specify a separate color scheme . use these including activated colour selection for front and background color . &quot;
playing at the start brings that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; after the program start playing the playback automatically with the piece in the place where it was stopped at the end of the finish line .
&quot; the sub@@ window on @-@ screen display allows you to switch off the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can preview the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the cross @-@ field shadow means that the text is sh@@ aded in the OS@@ D .
&quot; to use your own colors gives you the ability to adjust the OS@@ D colors for writing and background . one click on the color surfaces opens the dialog to color selection . if O@@ e colors do not use activated , the pre @-@ presented &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the input field display text presents the text in the OS@@ D text . by typ@@ ing space transm@@ itters can the OS@@ D be adjusted to your needs . below you will find a list of available space holder and what they mean .
&quot; the option screen is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can set up on which screen of a multi @-@ speed monitor environment should appear . &quot;
the car@@ p @-@ card audio @-@ output lets you select an audio driver from the selection field . some drivers enable additional inser@@ tion options in this mapping card .
the mapping card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for a folder in the collection , select the cross @-@ box next to his name . this section also contains an@@ kreu@@ z@@ fields on display , as should be used with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folders recur@@ sively browse : this means that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folders to music is as well .
&quot; changes : allows &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files can be added or deleted ) . furthermore , an incre@@ mental search carried out to be able to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folder ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection adds . the added play@@ lists will then appear later in the play@@ lists browser . &quot;
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination environment driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , there is another facility in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ q@@ l institution . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l @-@ institution is used for inser@@ tion the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok . then , the calcul@@ ator is entered , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is entered , under which the database is available . name : is the database name , to which the connection is made . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data required for the connection to the database .
the car@@ n@@ card load .@@ f@@ m is aimed at support for load .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; can transmit the names of pl@@ ung@@ ed pieces to a load .@@ f@@ m server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your load .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
split pieces send and so update the profile : this setting allows it &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your load .@@ f@@ m profile .
similar interpre@@ ters call : after activation of this setting is shown &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to the each played piece . note : you can view the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a load @-@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ok requires only the package K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no further K@@ DE packages . you need to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D pres@@ upp@@ oses that your window manager will hold the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ ES@@ top@@ .org , so Gn@@ ome is going to work , but flu@@ x@@ box is prepared for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , as these are an excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will make a mistake in the tag@@ li@@ b library . you can see this file by clicking on ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ scan _ scan . after that , you can delete the file and let the collection again create . &quot;
mostly this is that Tag@@ lib during reading the Met@@ a @-@ info from this file cras@@ hes . please report this error to the Tag@@ us developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , then check SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; is a little mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if Z. B. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , tag@@ li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x , this leads to crash with the editing of the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with art@@ s@@ d then disable autom@@ obil@@ es . turn off , if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or at least don &apos;t use any value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens at a crash ) , and you will send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the fact that many program will write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the met@@ a info , but not as a Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l die &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag = &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed using this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can simply click the tool@@ bar under appearance symbols . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol to three times , until this attitude shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : invisible symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pix@@ m@@ ap@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map . this can be checked with ld@@ d &apos;@@ which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ous Q@@ t version or remove / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok finds the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are easiest through the help of an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for developers . use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ illa is not suitable to search for help . please enter there only one mistake if you are searching for a mistake in Amar@@ o@@ ok .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears a blank playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
that is easy . use the file browser on the left side and open the folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intui@@ tively , the start @-@ up window was converted into the statisti@@ c window . you can find it under Ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ o@@ 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be displayed in the playlist the rating column is displayed . click anywhere in the new application column . click anywhere in the new application column . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ o@@ ok in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press release on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist from the fold @-@ down menu . &quot;
drag a play@@ lists file with the mouse into the playlist and let them drop exactly how you would make it with other files . so simple is that : - )
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the addition button , the button playlist is stored . click on it . &quot;
&quot; probably the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for li@@ b@@ ish , this package contains many very nice visu@@ alis@@ ations . &quot;
the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via right mouse button ) . furthermore you will find it via the menu bar under Ex@@ tras E@@ quali@@ zer ....
&quot; yes , this really is true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used one from the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question is what media types supports G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even support text and P@@ NG . &quot;
&quot; it can ! perhaps use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , which will be supplied in the default no MP3 @-@ decoder ( for patent @-@ legal reasons ) . the solution : old @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online Update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the Al@@ sa driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must provide a mix@@ er . a mix@@ er allows several applications to use the device at the same time and can be accessed by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . take a look at the assistance of your mix for al@@ sa . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you find the problem mur@@ mu@@ le and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different S@@ ink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ ard ) . &quot;
&quot; that does &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ co@@ ded . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ co@@ ded it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ co@@ ded the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print right to al@@ sa , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest potential priority ( warning output ) and increase the size of the sound bu@@ ffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause un@@ disturbed play . read this error report . the enlar@@ ging of the Sound Pu@@ ff@@ ers in your al@@ sa furnishings file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help well .
&quot; either you do not use the Arts drivers but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been optimized for analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts bu@@ ffer in the control center and sound &amp; Multimedia , sound system . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less jobs react the visu@@ alis@@ ations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to change to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , pl@@ unges &amp; Amar@@ ok ; from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all components . run G@@ ST register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask at IR@@ C @-@ Canal # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok beforehand ! ) : - Download your ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then check the module folder of G@@ Stre@@ amer all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and run G@@ ST reg@@ isters again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok . &quot;

&quot; thanks to D@@ COP , that is already possible . put an alarm in your calendar program and let you perform with the alarm of this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ o@@ player play . &quot;
&quot; this command leaves and Amar@@ o@@ ok . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ o@@ ok ; running before you go to bed , then you will be wo@@ ken by the gentle killing of the music which you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how can you find out the currently in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles can be found when one is at another computer ?
if a functional SSH environment is available you can proceed as follows . this command gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Amar@@ o@@ player now@@ Play@@ ing
replace IP address with your IP and your username . this requires ahead that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; press window separated . press on the keyboard and the current Analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size changing window . &quot;
the combination of Str@@ g + Right click turns a piece in the cli@@ ck@@ line in queue . by pressing the input button after a search in the playlist the first search result is played and the search will be reset .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but how about the icon in the control panel of the control panel ? &quot;

&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ pack Dec@@ oder : other libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg , it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn them onto a audio CD . &quot;
&quot; So@@ x : an aid program , which can be applied between different audio formats and convert . So@@ x is used by the So@@ x Audio Encoder module . &quot;
trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : a full @-@ equipped authors system to edit , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ zing video CDs and Super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool will be useful to fit the volume of music files on a standard level . this can be useful for example , to create a mix@@ er CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different absorption of the various albums can lead to the un@@ beautiful effect that the music pieces can vary depending on . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folders of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects again to load . the associated sub@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has been stored once , the previous file will be over@@ written , otherwise it is asked for a new file name . &quot;
saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog will be displayed with which you can choose folder and file name for the project file .
saves all ge@@ on@@ opened projects . that &apos;s the same as if you would call it save for each individual project file .
&quot; closes the current project . if a project has changed and still not saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; according to what has to be done . you can then break between save and change . besides , you can also stop the left and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each not stored project , which is to happen , just as if you would have called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; closes all opened projects and ended &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for each non @-@ stored project is asked , what it should happen to happen , as if you had called File Close . &quot;
&quot; when you access this entry , you can choose to add dialog files to addition to the project . this has the same effect as if you enter the files directly from the upper view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files in the basic folder of the CD will appear . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue &quot; &quot; burning &quot; &quot; opens up for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the characteristics @-@ dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above what is the ? help files ( reachable via right mouse button ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it is useful if you use files from a previous session into the current project . however , the data of the previous session will always be used , even if this function is not used , so that you can see the files already available on the medium already existing files and folders . &quot;
&quot; this entry only appears in an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature is prompted to remove files from the current project . all other files do not remain in the project . this feature removes no files from the medium , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files back . &quot;
&quot; you can also create the CD @-@ Kop@@ er dialog . alternatively , you can also copy the copying of a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only want to burn a copy of a CD instead of normal copying . you should also want to cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with broken sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; you can also create the DVD copy of DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also use a DVD to DVD with the help of copying dialogue . moreover , there is also the possibility of converting a DVD using copying dialogue , so the target medium must be large enough to be able to record the entire ( video ) data of the source medi@@ ums in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , making the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; allows you to choose between the spelling mod@@ i and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burning a previous CD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ barbecue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data , which then immediately will not be supported by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , for this you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning a previously put DVD @-@ off . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously illuminated DVD video can be converted . this dialog window appears usually after reading a DVD in the table view , but can also be used only . it contains information about the illuminated video , code settings and even options for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
shows information about the occasional medium . this information is displayed in the table view and contain properties of the medium like e.g. size and title length of the CD or DVD .
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bar of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is listed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar is displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; switch the folder view one or off . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD disk drives . if the table view is enabled , their contents are displayed in the table view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media information , locks and locking the run or throwing the medium . &quot;
&quot; adjust the table view , or from . the table view enables to select and pulling files into the projection screen . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , provided a drive selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; spl@@ its the p@@ iste in the projection pattern or off . the p@@ iste is a narro@@ wer range , which is only visible when the projection screens has no real function , it only looks pretty and separates the proj@@ ector clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog window to change the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; after one has chosen one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adjust the key@@ note to it below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ 3@@ b ; furnishings assistance . thus , the proper per@@ missions need to be adjusted for burning CDs and DVDs . therefore , system managers are required , so you must enter the password for the system manager ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
&quot; opens the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; here , the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b will open . almost all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialog is intended to person@@ alize and regulate the programming of the program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , with a &amp; D interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the slightly more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the function@@ all@@ ine , so it is more of your taste and the way of your task position to be decisive , which the accompanying programs you give . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we take note that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to use the &amp; D functions , you need to make sure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D functions , which have all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program in common , supports &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
the standard D@@ COP interface between &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ e CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ COP@@ Ref cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id Seri@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id jel@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id jel@@ at@@ D@@ v@@ d ( ) Vo@@ id vo@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ ate@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ ate@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id Bur@@ ate@@ D@@ v@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l ) Vo@@ id .
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method one gets a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ Ref ( K@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b ) Payment Meth@@ od . by using this reference , it is possible to change the project about K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ interface which is only applicable to data @-@ projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; Vo@@ id cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ string name ) Vo@@ id creams Ur@@ l ( K@@ URL ur@@ l , Q@@ String Par@@ ent ) Vo@@ id remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path ) Vo@@ id remo@@ ve@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ string new@@ name ) Vo@@ id set@@ vol@@ up@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) Vo@@ id set@@ vol@@ up@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String ) &quot;
&quot; for example , it is possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then adds files to the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p K@@ 3@@ b@@ interface cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT creams Ur@@ l / home / tru@@ cking / some@@ fi@@ le@@ .txt / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ read @-@ out for &amp; k@@ de ; with it , you can easily read audio CD ; s can be read and stored in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the Encoder of computers . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading of &amp; CD ; data in W@@ AV files on hard drive ) and by many Ko@@ di@@ ers , which are enco@@ ding these W@@ AV files ( los@@ ting free compression ) . further codes can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD ; read and stored in W@@ AV files on the computer ( los@@ ures free and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per titles ) compressed to the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or also into other formats such as los@@ ed @-@ free FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ us@@ until ( for O@@ GG ) or other codes are already available , so it is very likely not necessary to compile some yourself . however , only FLA@@ C is not used , the installation is not required . &quot;
which Ko@@ di@@ er@@ er- / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ ter Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to Ko@@ di@@ ers , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word about copying from protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the &amp; CD ; in any case , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any cop@@ ier protection ; simply prevent the purchase of cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while the setup only needs to be done ( the furnishings dialog , however , can be viewed as often as a suitable configuration ) , the daily approach to read a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of user interface , over which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB can be obtained from the Internet or can work completely without a network , where everything is manually recorded . &quot;
&quot; this is just a brief list of the commands of the main window . on the other step , more information on how this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of the CD data according to the layout of CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first connect to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts reading and - if a Encoder has been configured using enco@@ ding settings in the furniture catalogue - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , so that the choice with a different en@@ coder can be read as the default . it is to note that previously the Encoder has been configured using enco@@ ding settings in the dialog dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , allowing an already illuminated file to code enco@@ ding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
opens the dialog dialog to configure the type of aler@@ ts ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ sen ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; stop ) . &quot;
opens the main attraction dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different mapping cards ( like Encoder to set up the En@@ co@@ ders ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully !
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ di@@ ers and compression rates , and helps you choose the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information should go lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats , the information is lost through data comp@@ utation according to their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG may have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in the audio quality at lower Bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) but above this bit@@ rate , the differences will produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos; not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still free with most distri@@ butions free but there are open license questions &quot;
+ high to very high sound quality ( at high Bit@@ rates ) but compared to O@@ GG easily deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rates .
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stere@@ otypes . today - at first 2009 - these devices usually support only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for the audio quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer more acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces , and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex musical pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &quot; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate approximately 5.5 . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 . 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information , which are manually entered or fet@@ ched by the free@@ DB programme , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can be passed / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the codi@@ fication program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with co@@ ding programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) add when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switches must be added from l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button @-@ drawing in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which individuals can download the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded , so that all other information is spoken of : &amp; CD ; title , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc . , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( An@@ m of the name ) am not lawyer . however , nobody can prevent that you are inf@@ licted on the &amp; CD ; however , neither the artist nor the CD ; any more or less worth@@ less , so cannot be obtained with an B@@ um@@ mel by a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is actively used to select a cross @-@ line ( sending a address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; for use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphi@@ cally is needed to use the next mirror server . this saves bandwidth within the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a recent list of reflections on the online re@@ vocation of &amp; CD ; information during the reading of a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( generally created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read @-@ program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used , who wants to know more exactly , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must first be installed separately if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to save the illuminated W@@ AV files , the Ko@@ di@@ ers and thus the desired file format can be chosen . in the first opening there are pre@@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a loss of compression for audio data ) on the tab . other Ko@@ di@@ ers can be added on this tab . &quot;
the code @-@ parcel package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution prior to the codi@@ fication . this is also required for the pre@@ defined co@@ ders . for more information about Ko@@ di@@ ers are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
after installing a Ko@@ di@@ ers you can get more information on your switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ tion window ( eg ; console ) must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; this can have many causes . check the setup of the sound designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing - and les@@ bian , and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio @-@ enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give an indication of what is wrong . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the sleeve of the &amp; CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; read the complete manual , read everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas which will make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to create MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sampling ( tags ) .
&quot; there must be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your machine . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it is not completely free software files . anyway , it is not necessary to compile source files , which of course you can always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of it and that you have scre@@ aming ( eg by trying to copy something into the quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; something that probably is done only once and
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which must be repeated for each exp@@ ires &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; here we define the enco@@ ding codes for compression to music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . since we are lazy , we share the program with the free@@ DB to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we are likely not likely to change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device @-@ drawing is handed over to the read @-@ program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ Data / pieces .
&quot; frequently , / dev / CD@@ ROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , you can also take a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the available entries for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the mapping card universal settings . here you can &apos;t do much . here an additional conversion will be defined . in our example everything will be shown as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; only in order to ask for incomplete information , so that you will be informed if details are missing for the detection of keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
the car@@ Parts Card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD automatically download the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the Internet during the reading of the &amp; CD ; so that it can access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second drop field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; this is with low risk associated , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting file name / file name and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; aside from this example , further to note : if you want to enter everything manually , you disable the selection fields and free@@ DB will not use . however , this is worth using free@@ DB locally in offline mode , the two choices must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following mapping card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is available for us free@@ DB . these are settings for the data request , for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server through the Internet . how do the system , which data will be given the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB . please read the section about free@@ DB . &quot;
mode : we do not have the database to be downloaded , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB server : please go to the page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a reflection server close by . on this way , the load between the machines is distributed . however , this attitude will work as first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , since many fire@@ walls apply the protocol 88@@ 80 default , there is perhaps more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first an@@ cross field should turn off . &quot;
simply take the settings of the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure that the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time when only an existing drive ? parallel reading and code ? the author does not know , therefore simply trying . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , you tick this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the trial . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you can cross this cruise , then / must be specified the path / folder in which the W@@ AV files can be saved . if the box is not listed , the files are not listed in the private folder . do not forget this folder if you want to do something using the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; all just enter as it is shown in the scre@@ enshot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances , you need to feed something to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &quot; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the finished bit@@ rate is 6.3 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the finished compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage . &quot;
&quot; note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the restriction on the production of tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; ID@@ 3 &apos; Tag@@ ger for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) , and the output file ( including the full path ) . &quot;
set the rest as in the scre@@ enshot . some comments on future use outside this example :
&quot; number of files simultaneously to codi@@ fy W@@ AV files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than a W@@ AV file can be enco@@ ded simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic establishment of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; it ends . this configuration is chosen as a standard for any read of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , described how the process of reading the &amp; CD is described ; the folder structure , the way the music is organised on hard drive , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data of the free@@ DB will be described . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each exp@@ elling &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet included in free@@ DB , the screen sn@@ apshots are a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; therefore you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually put them out of the Internet . comments will point out on the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is to find . it is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , the &amp; CD has to be defined now ; into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , as shown in the scre@@ enshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as an audio CD ; could be read and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
if this does not happen then you are looking for questions and answers after help or go back to the previous section concerning the basic settings .
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was successfully picked up from the free@@ DB , all the titles of the pieces are already filled , and the name of the artist and album are shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than an entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; the key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t have selected the cross @-@ field for automatic query of free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in dialog for settings ) , you can also trigger this manually by choosing the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have local data , you need the access to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD @-@ editor - entry of the CD data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next scre@@ enshot photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &quot; Cur@@ rent title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist should no longer be entered in the &quot; &quot; Cur@@ eller title &quot; , &quot; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
the detailed comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ vi@@ ell per piece ; the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply to all pieces of the CD .
&quot; attention : after the successful re@@ vocation of the data from the free@@ DB , the CD editor is not empty , but it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words with big letters start or not ... ) , but also to consider if there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limited the length of fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 signs for the comment@@ aries . if you have ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags , you have an unlimited field length , at least to what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum . this option is set up on the tab code settings ; take a look at the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the day information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers to find more information .
&quot; simply select an entry that is obviously wrong with the style of the out@@ source CD . in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for further information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for example can be found under rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , go back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you can see that the boxes for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . specify the title of the piece in any case and other information that you wish . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the front data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are marked as are selected . make sure that all pieces are selected , or click the button All pieces select at the bottom of the screen to choose all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was launched by clicking the button selection reading the reading process , this window appears to confirm confirmation . OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and follow what runs . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders to switch on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece will be read on hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the lower part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message you can see if you are trying to work with a co@@ aster , which you have not yet installed . pieces which have not been successfully enco@@ ded with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the target sub@@ folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you write writing to the folder for the temporary files and the target folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it &apos;s clear why the error occurred directly after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; order 1 reads the first piece of it , it is finished . however , we have added a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . hence , read and code parallel . consider the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has not found configuration setting to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing that is configur@@ able , is the number of parallel processes for reading and enco@@ ding . at high @-@ rate machines , the result is unclear . the used machines with a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous read and enco@@ ding ( however , two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is read , while another piece is co@@ ded and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to generate compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the code of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; today it is maintained within the &amp; k@@ de ; CVS as part of the dem@@ nity media package . however , if you already include a pre @-@ compiled package , as &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de creator ; if you want to read this , you &apos;ve probably already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to individuals that compile from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help as the program can be adjusted to your needs , then the following is right for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variations of settings . best to read the step by step for the options and settings . it shows the images of the different mapping cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that can not be used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still read on ? even if only the help menu has been clicked according to the first starting point of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program boot no audio CD ; on drive ) , or from an unusually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it ? who reads this , presumably has already started the program . it should look like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is meant as the first version for a hand@@ book to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; thought . who also has something useful to add or change it , may do it . at least just after contacting the author . and if you want to read this , he agrees this section and therefore agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely if you have succeeded in getting the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N then you don &apos;t need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and caravan game of &amp; k@@ de ; beside others it has with real @-@ time frame and kar@@ a@@ oke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some properties that others &amp; UNIX . -@@ MIDI players do not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so it should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ tical proj@@ ector , which is needed for CIS . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequence . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel through high@@ lighting the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can move in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window on the cap can be drawn .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( song@@ events or cre@@ denti@@ als ) . K@@ Mid automatically determines the procedure used .
sitting support . if you stop &amp; k@@ ish ; during the play of a song , K@@ mid will start again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI @-@ Syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , privileges , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
you can also let a file from a &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window will drop . this also works with several songs simultaneously .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and click the button drop in the tool@@ bar , select the entry play from the menu piece or click the blank . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts when you drag it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . ( in several pieces they are added to a collection and then re @-@ recorded each other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece plays , you can jump to any point by using the middle mouse button and drive along with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow , you can click on the arrows on the left and right of the temp@@ o . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the whit@@ e@@ ar like a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu piece , so break down the playback . pressing the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playing . &quot;
Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a musical piece . some pieces use text @-@ event , others use li@@ ed@@ tex@@ ter@@ eig@@ nis and again others both . some pieces do not have text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; mid ; you can set what events are to be presented and even better : the E@@ rec@@ ycle type is automatically detected , the one song is used , so you have nothing to manually set the item Autom@@ atic text . however , you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up a pre @-@ type type , select from the menu settings the entries of text events or song events . the same function also have the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summar@@ ize . these will be played in line . in this section stands as you can use collections efficiently .
&quot; to attach a collection , you first open the collection manager . this can be found in the menu Collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there in New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can adjust the treatments in the collection manager . &quot;
to the temporary collection get all the songs you want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collection manager . here , you can add a song with the button Add . it appears in the file dialog , with which help you choose the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when Autom@@ atically is enabled to the collection , a piece is automatically added when opening ( using File Open or drag &amp; Drop ) automatically to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if autom@@ obil@@ es add to the collection is not enabled , when opening a piece the temporary collection is activated and checked . this collection will then be added to the opening pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you choose the sequence according to the menu collection of the menu collections , the songs are shown in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add songs or select a random order in the menu , the order will be re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selective list above the kar@@ a@@ oke text . &quot;
&quot; to further jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu piece or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back a song , select the button previous piece , the entry previous piece of the menu piece or press the button to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection there and click on the button Dele@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection can not be deleted . however , that doesn &apos;t matter since they are leaving for leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI @-@ events in events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et , and thus always let a trumpet sound , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound@@ card GM @-@ compatible ( incl@@ . ) and CIS - cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file of hand ( with your favorite author ) . &quot;
a MIDI @-@ map is a text file that stores all the required re@@ alizations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . prerequisite for this is , however , that every appearance has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a paragraph is achieved . &quot;
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
&quot; in this section , it will be indicated as the patches of General MIDI to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that GM patches in the right order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with clay 60 ) , which can be similar to a gun . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( connection ) , it is patch 100 ( the drums on your keyboard ) and play the tone 60 , regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to be a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ instrument ( drums , pel@@ vis , Mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not the one where the tone represents the sound height of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument . use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their presence . so you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to make notes on the per@@ ch @-@ channel canal . look out as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
this section can be used to switch some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel you can easily take this in CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section .
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have perc@@ ussion on a specific channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , are based on the following patterns : &quot;
&quot; n here is the channel , which is illustrated on the channel N . if you use the Key@@ map option , the key@@ map is necessary to use the name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ patch option , all events will continue to change the patch on this channel . in this case , then patch x is used . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for instance to always use the Persian patch on the per@@ k@@ conversation channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates , in which ratio Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der event will be multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a Pit@@ ch @-@ ben@@ der event , this is only passed on with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the Map file no dec@@ imal number ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that gets a Pit@@ ch gasoline @-@ event with the value 40@@ 96 , to play a note higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards will win two sounds up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , just open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find this in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the canal view is a window with a whole bunch of cl@@ vi@@ ons ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these pi@@ vi@@ ons , you see which sounds are being played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel there is a selective list where you can choose an instrument , lights the button not green but red , to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the canal view ( up to now ) has two different views to indicate the played notes . view in the menu settings under the point of channel view : settings
&quot; the pace @-@ LCD shows the speed at which a song is played , the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so , if you find , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece needs to be played . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . . this can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , as well as two different musicians play the same notes at very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I can comp@@ el anyone , &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( an compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have compiled a Bin@@ ding distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid . to fix the issue you need to download and install an source distribution ( for example by k@@ mid ; &apos; s home ) &quot;
&quot; I &apos;d like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I do not want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; do not agree &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; beforehand , enable the setting of automation to the collection . otherwise , the files are added to temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow key left from the tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD double @-@ click .
&quot; I have a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ work@@ space a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; - window with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I want to play a kar@@ a@@ oke file ) or add a file , only to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window switch and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you want to listen to a file quickly without making them equal to a collection , turn the setting of automation to the collection , and the new one file will be added to temporary collection t.@@ opening of files &quot;
&quot; suppose you suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. first you just want to play the first file . so set the setting of automation to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then close yourself to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and make a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you very much ! if I see these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ates me , continue on &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;

a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends considerably from your sound card . it is not the same as if you use a FM device or a machine card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL page . it then runs as if you could hear a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files from the M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD s , V@@ CD &apos;s or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; the application window is formed from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . either there is a window with the playlist . and finally , there is a information window that will only be displayed when information is displayed in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to play the preferred compounds under the menu book@@ marks but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which are to be played after each other , you should use the category permanent playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarch@@ ical recording . when you click on an entry , its group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and the playback starts with the clicked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can be changed by an editor , but also through the application itself . simply by clicking a sub@@ group , the XML content of this section is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , the menu has to be chosen with playlist and either the modified mode is chosen , or another category will be chosen . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost when the processing mode is left or another group is selected , without the playlist . &quot;
&quot; due to the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation at the start and end can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able c and Change by &#91; General Options &#93; No in@@ tro = 0 ob@@ session option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will notice the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / /
&quot; the animation at startup needs not to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end @-@ animation , however the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the ads of a favourite photos : &amp; lt ; b ; &amp; lt ; s ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; in@@ sti@@ ff &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ f &quot; sr@@ c = &quot; in@@ f &quot; sr@@ c / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit &quot; ; are in the directory testing / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider on the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the inter@@ storage size of the data stream can be adjusted from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for de@@ bu@@ gging is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visible .
there is no rider for this playback device in the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ able c . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa is played :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be played by the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module , as a service provider for the M@@ ime type , / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the furnishings dialog file att@@ achments indicated by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is to start in a consoles application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the stressed process is called p@@ player . if here no error occurs , the back@@ end issue inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( View , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; thus becoming a pre @-@ prescribed back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type ( of course only if this was also determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ .@@ c . for example , phon@@ eme is supposed to reproduce all logged files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either by means of M@@ Player or X@@ video ( this takes k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog , or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( video data Rec@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player , the dialog is to use in the settings below - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ DR@@ - &gt; ( e.g. it PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has included a DV@@ B in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support from k@@ m@@ player can only use X@@ video ( probably this type of recording of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , this will have to be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally are used by KM@@ Player for the sources different names . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , dv@@ d source , dv@@ d source , source source , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there any evidence as to make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter when I play it from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / CD@@ ROM can be done as a user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely secure to ensure that / dev / CD@@ ROM shows on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
X@@ ine starts only slowly and why does my CPU need to be tested for their performance each time ?
note : the answer is over@@ hol@@ .@@ k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last stored value , only the first time x@@ ine check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ;
l@@ atex ; : a professional writer application . under Unix @-@ like systems will probably be applied to the package &amp; text live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution program should be used for the installation of the distribution of the distribution and installation disc ; / DVD .
the &amp; ki@@ le ; project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; -@@ website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users should hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , support for this project or documentation should be made to contact the ki@@ le ; -@@ website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions about or during comp@@ iling of &amp; ki@@ le ; or if extensions desired , this should be addressed to the mailing list of ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for use of all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ work@@ space . additionally , offers the possibility to complete all &amp; l@@ atex ; functions in a graphical user interface as well as conversion tools for these . finally , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and its possibilities should learn the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
for l@@ atex ; is the right place : L@@ ay @-@ TECH ; is the right place : L@@ ay @-@ TECH ; difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( engl@@ .@@ L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is also available that it comes from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here only a good mental view to &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book to go . about H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ AL@@ Y , A Guide to &amp; l@@ atex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd Edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ . &quot;
&quot; just as other figures discussed includes &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the most general properties such as paper format , lateral number@@ ing and text color begins with the command \ \ \ { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ by } command . &quot;
&quot; the quick entry @-@ entry assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a convenient feature for fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) provides some possibilities for the creation of the document . there can also be some features related to the document . &quot;
&quot; documentation classes : this type of document is mentioned : articles ( article ) , Book &#91; letter &#93; , Book &#91; letter &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; scr@@ re@@ pr@@ t &#93; , article &#91; pro@@ ver@@ er &#93; , slides &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user . &quot;
code : this is the character enco@@ ding is adjusted . modern systems are increasingly using the UT@@ F @-@ 8 code enco@@ ding as standard . best if the UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x are used ( for correct processing of l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; this list includes the most commonly used additional packages for l@@ atex ; for the integration of m@@ alls , they are only logged in the cross @-@ field . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Let@@ ter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . you should always use the creation of German texts . &quot;
new users are not worried about now . it &apos;s just a brief description of the functions and further information about this are given in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , attitudes and elements ( as well as the appropriate ) . by &amp; ki@@ le ; however , you should also noticed through the humble appearance of the output file . however , you can save it through the modest appearance of the output file . however , you will save you through the high@@ lighting time and shar@@ pen@@ ing time . &quot;
&quot; with automatic de@@ composition of the environments , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ &apos; { command } ) by &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically a blank lines ( for input of the text ) and the per@@ ched line at the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ \ \ command } ) . this function can be de@@ activated in the menu settings ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most common and more subtle , the lowest element ) : &quot;
&quot; in view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a mouse @-@ click on the respective side . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in search of your own &amp; l@@ atex ; once a DV@@ I , file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ eig@@ File ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by one click with the middle mouse button in DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer on the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the format and also other information such as font , and is beside PDF the most popular output type of &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and printing of DV@@ I ; -@@ files for different systems and upri@@ ghts . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ink , the elements of the DV@@ I ; -@@ file with the editor was sket@@ ched , and once upon a item in the DV@@ I ; -@@ source code was sc@@ anned , the corresponding section is plug@@ ged in the l@@ atex ; -@@ source text is attached to the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document the work is made with other integrated .@@ tex files . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be adjusted to project settings .
quick : the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text is compiled and the result will be displayed automatically ( unless there are no errors in the source text ) .
&quot; file A@@ wak@@ ening : in this mode the DV@@ I ; -@@ file on cli@@ que , cli@@ que , and there is no call of &amp; oc@@ ular@@ line ; after the rapid construction . &quot;
&quot; in viewing the Edit tool@@ bar , the three large @-@ scale selection fields marked up to all . the selection fields have been developed for the fast delivery of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Re@@ ver@@ able &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the selection field More is for example of articles such as keywords , joints , or references . the available options are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for one section , an image or other element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection above a selection field ) .
&quot; when applying quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; b ; the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ field with the name Gr@@ Ã ¼ e is used for setting the font . it can be set the font for the main text , the joints , etc . there are the following fonts , including : &quot;
&quot; in the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for the creation of a new document by selecting the document type and determining the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ &apos; class includes the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font . the font should not be set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
once the above source code has to be entered into the l@@ atex ; -@@ source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or of the button of quick @-@ making .
the code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage the storage is automatically saved .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be looked for in the log after errors . when using rapid development , it should be started . if this is not the case , the log should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English ) is a text that will be treated differently from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font should have been created and only a few sentences are to use a different font . the command \ \ \ { Environment } , \ \ \ \ \ and \ \ \ } allows you to get the most part of the font within the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the changes are only stored within the environment ( from \ \ &apos; { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) downhill , there is no connection ( number ) to the above @-@ type within an environment . &quot;
&quot; there are many possibilities to detect the read@@ ability and ease of use of the document . for example , certain fonts , fat pressure , sub@@ cut@@ ters , etc . add @-@ ups either with the command \ \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin of { emp@@ h } : this command is open to the short pressure and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be displayed with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ Per@@ rate : creates a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ &apos; { ratio } and ends with \ \ &apos; { Per@@ cent@@ age } .
&quot; once the background was shown to write the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ pron@@ unciation , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for the creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit &apos; text was entered , a few adjustments to the better read@@ ability of the document should be accomplished . therefore , a quotation , a few positions in fat and cur@@ ative print and a poem comes to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , via Editor @-@ View or Str@@ g E can be returned to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . with an external viewer , its windows must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I ; file was created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script file ; simply try and spa@@ wn . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a common file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ eig@@ ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .@@ d@@ vi issue such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ conver@@ ters or computer screen . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DV@@ I ; file the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking DV@@ I , the document can be printed by file Dru@@ cken ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is correct ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DV@@ I ; file into other formats . as soon as the DV@@ I ; -@@ file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ source text was created , the conversion will begin by means of other formats in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the prefer@@ ential search allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position inside the DV@@ I ; -@@ file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ s files . this only needs to furn@@ ish modern under settings ti@@ le ... tools be@@ ys .
&quot; to di@@ gest the pre @-@ search search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and clicked on board search . the jump to the appropriate place in the DV@@ I ; viewers will then be carried out . &quot;
with this feature in the DV@@ I ; - with one click of the middle mouse button in DV@@ I ; - document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; - document of &amp; ki@@ le ; inv@@ ading and to the corresponding line . this must be specified &amp; ki@@ le ; in &amp; oc@@ ular@@ line ; as a text editor set up ... Editor )
&quot; if a mistake should not appear in the handling of the &amp; DV@@ I ; viewers cannot find an error . should an error appear , this will be shown in the log file or in the news window . &quot;
&quot; the log file doesn &apos;t complain the error source in the source text . in the editor then the kno@@ b La@@ Te@@ X defect can be used in which the error appears . the log file is always displayed in the error message , the error must be cool@@ ed to the error in the log and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to the faul@@ ty row . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window appears to choose the template for the document . the options presented are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting le@@ eres document , a document can either be re@@ written or used to create a new document . further information can be used in the section . &quot;
&quot; users of &amp; l@@ atex ; mostly use the same introduction to virtually all documents . templates can be stored in &amp; ki@@ le ; added , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file should be created , or a new file will be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selecting a file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character enco@@ ding ) . these variables can be set up in settings to set up settings ... &quot;
&quot; when creating the own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
&quot; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into the documentary category . typically , they will be used in the following form : \ \ document@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard , and the thus built @-@ up inser@@ ts of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps have been accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can be viewed instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; l@@ atex ; files will be created . a simple way to create a template , should be looked after one on the internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is an editor of reading and high@@ lighting of many different types of text files ( including also l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for programmers directly from &amp; ki@@ le ; out .
to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and his possibilities should learn the manual to K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; - Command refer@@ ence , which can be inv@@ oked a valid description of virtually all commands that can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; use of the syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with dr@@ unken string button to look at the &amp; tex ; word processor . that means that in this way , by clicking \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; when pulling the text with attached mouse button , the text is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , the parts of the source pane can be washed in the editing window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibilities to search for different types of source texts and to emphasize these things . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex commands differ from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu features a jump to the first or last jumping mark . thereby , this jump is highlighted , so that it is automatically deleted at the first entry of a sign . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate , have been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for their selection . under editing , the following commands are included to the text selection : &quot;
&quot; one paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines included on both sides a blank lines ) . with a paragraph is not included a text with cross @-@ level lines ( as in other text enco@@ ders ) . this advanced significance includes tables , &amp; l@@ atex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . the only preventive thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is thus that the output is separated by two blank lines . &quot;
the word under the current curr@@ y position . this selection has also an advanced meaning since this command is also l@@ atex ; -@@ commands with a bunch of course ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) at the end .
&quot; for viewing a part of the document , the button can be removed from this first . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ note c@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers the following commands to include a faster result . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition of a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of editing paragraph paragraph .
&quot; it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF : more commands under editing environment for a very simple work with &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
this command is arranged at the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to use the surrounding area .
this command is arranged at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is located before or within the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } , becomes the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many spar@@ ed ambient commands , the command can quickly go lost . this command slept the most recently opened environment so that the dis@@ closing ambient structure does not appear . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ groups which are determined by stap@@ les { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a couple of important commands that suit those from Edit surroundings .
this command is called for the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the soft brack@@ ets .
this command will set up to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded brack@@ ets .
if the cursor is before or behind the wel@@ ded brack@@ et of a &amp; tex ; group # is placed to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many spar@@ ed groups @-@ brack@@ ets can quickly get lost from the perspective , the most recently opened group , so that the spar@@ ed structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not f@@ lin@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in l@@ atex ; two simple addition marks are used as a type of equipment . for the affir@@ mation of the instructions is used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple equipment marks . also for the affir@@ mation of the attached signs is used , and l@@ atex ; one . &quot;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double bedroom signs can set up under settings ti@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and be left out .
you can also use L@@ Ã ¼ n@@ der@@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) and therefore German or French . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; at the end of Shift ; input taste for a smart for@@ ef@@ ace . if the current position is located within a lists of en@@ umer@@ ate ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , the current position within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ umer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) is available , not only a poin@@ ter , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables environment , t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with a respectable for@@ ef@@ um@@ nia . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ presented &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments to be supported by settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) . &amp; ki@@ le ; sought to use this . &amp; ki@@ le ; according to the most common t@@ abo@@ o in the above line . although this Tab@@ ulator is not the per@@ imeter , to the columns position of the current t@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; a good source code has already been extended , these are still expanded in &amp; ki@@ le ; in order to have specific commands ( mostly for l@@ atex ; ) working three different modes of work . all these modes can set up different working methods , set up under settings to set up ... &quot;
&quot; when you start a new environment using the command \ \ &apos; { surroundings } , &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically added the command \ \ \ &apos; setting } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when the kn@@ it@@ ching taste is removed , the last letter of the input will be removed and the complete list is thereby the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed from selection of a command . alternatively , jump from &amp; ki@@ le ; also jumping brands can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions by means of Edit spring@@ marks is possible and the fixed parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; set up settings ; set up settings ; complete settings on these lists can be made . - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands , as well as W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ents of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the instruction mode is for the complete processing of environments not n@@ ent . there are always a few letters with \ \ be entered and the call of full @-@ consuming mode will have a crude list with ambient conditions . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the complete over@@ lap mode , the command to change the environment is automatically set up and it appears \ \ . after that , the ambient temperature is continued in the simplest way and through to the input , the input can be finished . &quot;
&quot; after this is accomplished , the environment will be automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; realize that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is set up . &quot;
&quot; under settings ki@@ le ; set up ... ki@@ dy ; complete settings on these lists can be made . this mode uses the machine list of the complete pres@@ upp@@ r &amp; tex ; - and l@@ atex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; supported user @-@ defined lists of cras@@ hes that are immediately set up by le@@ aning strings . the lists can contain ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word used mode is introduced to the menu and the key@@ note mode , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; rough che@@ eses are not helpful for automatic refin@@ ing . however , it has been found that many W@@ aters have been written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the complete damage to all already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can set up in the menu of C@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ sions . here , also the Corpor@@ ations for display can be specified . &quot;
&quot; the complete disp@@ osi@@ tions can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / / / / / / / / / / / usr / mode / the Persian home folder . mode stands for alignment ( separation ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ Ã ¼ r@@ ter@@ book ) or vor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed as simple as possible . for viewing the bases on the graphics formats , sections and sections should be observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for viewing and re@@ arrangement of pages . the PDF version can be re @-@ arranged and then converted to a PDF file with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf file . &quot;
&quot; to examine the results of work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus to create comp@@ iling , create and create a view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source text for viewer such as &amp; oc@@ ular@@ line ; or the other conversion can be used the key@@ note Alt ; 3 used by old ; 4 the DV@@ I ; file into a PS file and file called Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the Command Con@@ struc@@ ture , it is usually called a spect@@ ator after comp@@ iling . should not be used in the und@@ ener viewer , each new window will be used . &quot;

&quot; the API scripts are not yet developed , and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; even more . &quot;
first must be said that the output environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a systematic object ( = ki@@ le ) with the following methods :

&quot; a complete refer@@ ee for &amp; tex ; and at the same time , it is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather it is ideal for searching for a specific form@@ atting . as it is a very rough document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents related to those &amp; tet@@ ex ; the Fin@@ der of the right document is not always easy . as a common help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; the small application ly@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which includes a database of all , delivered documents and thereby a graphic upper area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories and the common advantage is the search for package names or stroke . of &amp; ki@@ cks , then only the results are displayed . &quot;

&quot; output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files will be deleted every time , if pro@@ c will start . &quot;
&quot; as already said , everyone who has already worked on the &amp; D , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; there is now a great graphical interface for it . &quot;
&quot; if the just opened file inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is , then they just leave the current working folder . if not , then select current working folder and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ do@@ book is available . &quot;
when it comes to an output on the screen your file is faul@@ ty . please check the faults and try again .
&quot; if the file is already highlighted in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; then they simply leave the current file . if not , they delete the tick into current file and select the file by means of other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you only want to know if the file well @-@ known , then click the Well @-@ tech review . &quot;

&quot; if the file should be printed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; it &apos;s already marked , then the current file will simply be chosen . if not , remove the selected file and select the file using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should be named , the file is usually saved in their home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; it may have little to do with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; it might benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone can use the ge@@ wished in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. for more information about it . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a box , we start with the menu @-@ plug @-@ in Edit menu . this dialog will be opened : &quot;
this dialog allows you to ad@@ minister all the included plug @-@ ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
&quot; here you can enter the search trail . when adding @-@ plug @-@ ins without a memory location , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this path to search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often working on a project several individuals in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship with each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; supports the specification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties tab .
the name and e @-@ mail entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Ni@@ ck@@ name is the user name of the user and serves as a clear identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team@@ leader as well as sub@@ project leader . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of members who he is . this happens by applying the team member from the list and put the button as a press . the currently selected member ( its identity ) appears : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important with regard to news and notes . see for further information on notes .
beside the overview of your team there is another advantage with the capture of the members of the team : it can be created an event for the information to the team leader when something happens . see in for more information .
&quot; event actions are actions that can be executed when something is done in the project . an example would be a record of opening and closing the project , so later that a file is saved , or a script that is added to CVS , as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges can create events , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see list of the addres@@ see list . the addres@@ see may be a team@@ - or sub@@ project leader . see in , we@@ i such ladder will be set up . &quot;
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
&quot; typ@@ ing comments is simple . it can be chosen either the note -@@ entry from the editor @-@ context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word entered in a commentary text followed by key@@ note text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent a determin@@ able member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nickname of the project leaders and sub@@ project leaders should be given the corresponding departments or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
&quot; nickname and re@@ els names are independent of large or small , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invalid . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ T@@ D diagnostic and web@@ based form@@ atting and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; specific settings are treated , a short description for the other can be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up using the Qu@@ anta settings ... called . this dialog extends over several pages that are dealt with .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; on tags including car completion can be modified . the entries are :
large / Klein@@ aphr@@ asing of tags : big / Klein@@ spelling by automatically applied tags . normal Groß / Klein@@ spelling means the tags are inserted as they are described in the day XML files .
&quot; large / Klein@@ aphr@@ ased by attributes : big / Klein@@ aphr@@ ased by automatically applied attributes . normal Groß / to@@ graphy means , the attributes are inserted as inserted in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically include : if noted , it is optional for tags , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after the end ; added . &quot;
non optional tags automatically include : as on top for all other tags with the exception of the simple tags .
&quot; starting and closing day automatically update : when switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding co@@ ding during the inser@@ tion .
&quot; M@@ IM@@ E types : facial types for detection of different types of files . by means of a button standard , the default ones can be restored . &quot;
standard Dia enco@@ ding : the enco@@ ding of newly created files or in other ways than with file opening open files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be avoided ) but this setting is loaded here by the same in the projection characteristics if a project is loaded .
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D is not recognized . this attitude here will be copied from the same in the projection characteristics if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; created regular backup copies , so by black@@ out or crash at the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . it is not the same as storing the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be shown either in the editing area or a separate view ( or the documentation in a car@@ pond ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings on the standard back at the next start is useful when the user interface through modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views through each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning @-@ out area is serving the taxes of the possibility to ask the display of warnings by An@@ ha@@ ken of non @-@ queries .
&quot; the place around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be specified the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source text view in the shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here , the Par@@ ser and the Stru@@ c@@ tive tree , which depic@@ ts the illustration of the Par@@ ser knot@@ s in the document , in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse @-@ click on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural control settings , the visibility of no@@ des is to be automatically opened in editing and how deep when modi@@ fying the structural tree is to be opened automatically . empty knot@@ s are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are such as no element found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; the area to commemor@@ ate the abbrevi@@ ation of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) which can be un@@ matched when editing with extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each one can apply for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation is something different from Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plugins , the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plug @-@ ins are sub @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re @-@ used by any K@@ part @-@ capable application , most well @-@ known &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; for inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not on a stand@@ still like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file to the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the folder folder . &quot;
component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plugin does not deny the loading . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse the store when this option is not chosen .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this activated , then tested &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; if the offered information is correct . choose the saving of the inser@@ tion even if the plugin is currently not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; starting from version 3.3 , the bu@@ gging was completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was adjusted , as well as support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept has been implemented , which allows various implement@@ ations about plug @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available that adds support to the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the Debug@@ ger Plugin the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . usually appears in the left @-@ hand dock .
&quot; a view in which all semi @-@ points are listed , with poin@@ ter numbers and conditions are usually listed in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is displayed . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
&quot; with this action , the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or she shares the plugin with , to listen to debit requests . this action is run by default , when a project is opened , so that normally it should not be respected . &quot;
the counterpart at de@@ bu@@ gging session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the lau@@ ghing according to requirements .
sends a HTTP request to the server to insert a debit request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the issue of this requirement is displayed in the review de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger , with the execution of the script to start and information about the monitored variables as well as the currently defined line is ongoing , the execution is continued before a debit request has been started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without any information to be monitored variables and the current poin@@ ter number . when this happens , the execution runs further . when a debit request is given , the execution starts , as soon as a requirement is placed . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger runs the next order in the script without entering into the functions or needs .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next order in the script , where possible in functions and needs to be faul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; points the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next one , as if there were not the current ones . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog , in which a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the supervised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog can be entered into a variable or a new value of a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keit@@ h Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front @-@ end and a K@@ part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on htt@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g.@@ s@@ f@@ .net with many other works of Keit@@ h .
&quot; this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; to suit your needs , and how to help you &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; help to get better . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting pack@@ ets ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to give support for market and scripts , as well as &amp; CSS ; to give them a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web development , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and the tool@@ bar . the tag folder included two data types , the &amp; b p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and day @-@ XML files are included , the text and instructions faster into a document , as a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create equ@@ XML files , then the &amp; b p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ ing . in short , a &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags and the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ di@@ alo@@ ges , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even tool provide fast inser@@ ting tags in a document without danger of writing . &quot;
&quot; tag folder are nothing but a folder . they only contain the &amp; b p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag folder carry the name of the compl@@ aining language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary , or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to give other users a better insight and more information about working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and borders will be shown in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of an equ@@ XML document . it can only exist once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains as only one element type over itself . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when used is called &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the tag@@ ty@@ p class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only applicable to the Type Meth@@ od . gives the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a single attribute and the attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into dialogue . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; day . this is an element @-@ element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of a tag . this element can only happen once for any attribute . it lays the name and type of the attribute . additionally there are other tags , which should describe how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element @-@ element @-@ type element . &quot;
&quot; indicates the source of the source text for the attributes in the tag Edi@@ tor@@ dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p @-@ methodology within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % day @-@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container day that group@@ ed the elements of a list together . it can only occur for a attribute . it is an element @-@ element element .
sets the position of the attribute of a tag within a dialogue . this day can only occur for any attribute in a dialogue ( e.g. once for each attribute ; att@@ r &gt; day ) . the element is empty .
&quot; gives the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each one ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; day ) . this element is empty . &quot;
there is a list of elements that may occur within the defined tags . this element is an element type .
prints a list of elements that end a day . this element is an element type .
all day @-@ XML files must start with a &amp; XML ; declaration begin : ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be neat and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; dis@@ lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the equ@@ XML files , the tools are set up in the fields of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to start the window and check the X@@ ML@@ X@@ ML@@ .@@ A dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . currently , check only when charging the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; in the following example for a family 1 day XML file , this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; -@@ schema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this equ@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following example for a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file , one &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this equ@@ XML file is supposed to be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; = US@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &quot; &quot; session _ name &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; &quot; string &gt; &amp; day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Ds p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor available , accessible via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created an easy &amp; ver@@ bial line ; with the following entries : &quot;
&quot; &#91; General &#93; version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D . ( / / T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified , the name will be used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can be made with settings actions ... created . click New action to the same dialog :
&quot; with clicking the keyboard button . by clicking the user interface , you can be assigned a short@@ cut . with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ecting settings and in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can use external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; even if the fast start - dialogue or the various refer in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
although qualified paths are permitted , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line : global scrip@@ ting folder : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts / scripts /
&quot; % f : we will be replaced with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : will be replaced with P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; only one instance is running , the text becomes unique to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. from the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above methods there can be a script entry of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. from default . in the drop @-@ field input can be determined , which is to send to the default output . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected range of the document will be sent to the script . the % input is usually useful only with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the implemented application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output , written on the default output ; it can be specified using the text written on the default output , making the value the selection issue is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the market @-@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create a tool@@ bar for each group . in any given case , it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self @-@ explan@@ atory . pressing the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add it to the day to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete all and , if the day has attributes , and you can plan their usage , enable you to edit dialog &quot; Day , &quot; if available , so that an entry to the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in connection with this symbol ? replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we are &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; please select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting kno@@ b as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually considered less , rigid , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to user will be sign@@ aled ; start@@ led this symbol to the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to action . this happens via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ) and selecting the desired action . in addition to the text field there is one button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored symbol is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the use button and continue it with other tags , so it still exists , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ features to tool@@ bar , or it should be setting this to better overview by some tr@@ ators in several groups . open the tool@@ bar line using settings tool . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; I want to choose the tr@@ ator ( very left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element that should be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to preview a quick way to access the quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , how the separ@@ ators do not support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by proxy of all symbols , to ensure that everything works . &quot;
&quot; after re @-@ XML does not exist in the right folder . after new XML does not exist , there will be im@@ partial folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be saved in the right folder ( s ) , when a file is open from the appropriate type . &quot;
perhaps the worth mentioning extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. for the normal user is the ability to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ atting language that you like most . therefore this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use .
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; Re@@ pository , whether someone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part is left to you , the second we treat here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ figuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc You = path , relatively to this file , to the documentation files , e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 Sec@@ tions = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html 2 = # Sec@@ 2.2 Sec@@ tions = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html 2 = U@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html 2 = 3 1.@@ html 2 = &gt; 1 . &quot;
the section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary movie . for example do you see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so something :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element = php of content = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = In@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ tro@@ duction = Re@@ tro@@ duction = Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ cy@@ .@@ html ...
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with their own content . there is no known border for the chess bag ( except through reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ential at the top of the Bau@@ man@@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but watch on &amp; and &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; D ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; resources are being replaced .
&quot; the section section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is intended for the design of the context @-@ sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script _ fetch _ array function is to be displayed . there are only two types of entries click here : the context list ( text list ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
&quot; a simple list of separated context elements which are to be available ( for &amp; PHP ; , these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) . &quot;
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save , according to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as you specified this in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these well and it are worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to use by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. -@@ community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best Web@@ Develop@@ ing platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; are you not alone . it is possible to share the resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ sets with other actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise . at different places there is an e @-@ mail address , like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) using email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. users can download it . the contributions are reviewed and only available when our team needs them as accurate and user @-@ full of publishing , which ensures a GP@@ G / P@@ GP key . thus , the origin of resources is ensured , both for our team and for later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for their private GP@@ G key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not stored ) , or in the case that you will have several keys , you can enter an order . in the dialog New resource , you need to keep an out . in the dialog New resource you need to be filled out ( URL preview can be empty ) and by clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ loading can be up@@ loaded by the menus D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool@@ bar , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , even before installation , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signature . in case of problems , it can be canc@@ eled and it can be cancelled correctly . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the declaration of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages , which is currently not created by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. ; it can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of day files will be necessary in the day XML format . there is the easier way to convert a D@@ T@@ D automatically into a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D store and converting a D@@ T@@ D menu . select the .@@ d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description which should be used . afterwards the following dialogue appears :
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; will be written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition line : the string , displayed in ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day , such as HTML Public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ d@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot;
setting the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; according to the conversion of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , there are some key concepts . to understand this and to get full benefit from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this chapter tries to give them precisely these concepts without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; little benefit . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the work@@ space is divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for each one who is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; stored by tool@@ ing through actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. ; this allows the group of administrators different tool systems to secure promotions and patterns in the global tree , which are then available to each of them in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ making . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related items are available only within a specific project . this can be done everything from &amp; CSS ; -@@ patterns up to tool can be specially filed for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are set out in the folder tree of the project which includes the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edi@@ tor@@ window , the man@@ age@@ views , the car@@ n@@ re@@ ites with info and the tool @-@ making . please hit , and for more information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the car@@ rot with the right mouse button to receive a context menu with the current document pass@@ able entries , such as close the current , other or all the car@@ rot , re@@ charge , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editing area lead to a further context menu regarding the edited document content , such as the basic processing steps ( cutting / paste / paste ) , editing of the file under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , when the string is referred to under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top of the editors of the editing pane , the tool@@ bar takes place . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as a standard for which a set of tool@@ sets is shown . in the course of further execution of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the machine tools are adapted to the new features and associated user requirements . &quot;
&quot; using tools is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , e.g. &amp; lt ; then click on the icon which represents the tag on . now , you can insert the data for this just added tag . should they want to insert the data for this just added tag ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog various fields . &quot;
&quot; the man@@ age@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to navigate within the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to navigate , to open and ro@@ am . in the representation of the car@@ ou@@ re@@ ites are available for files , project , sample templates , document , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; this view shows all the files in the project and allows the administrator of the files in the project by means of right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading , or delete files from the storage medium can be carried out using the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; the use of templates . almost everything can be a template . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which connection they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; working area is always available , local templates are only available for the corresponding users and templates in projects are available only in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . on the right mouse button , more functions are available , such as the script to start , edit or send with email . &quot;
with this view one shows the internal structure of the active document . by links @-@ clicking on the document the cursor is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element it opens a list of commands in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree .
this tree appears among the other tree views . with it can change some quick attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace . that allows the contents of any available attributes with just a few clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation on web technology for your development to find . it can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc into a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; two car@@ bons at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the beneficial information : the window window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this car@@ rot displays information about each in the Qu@@ anta @-@ running script . for example , the currently used D@@ T@@ D of the current document and any changes to D@@ T@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this car@@ rot displays all errors in the market @-@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; scripts , which are executed , give all error messages ( so there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; tool@@ sets are extensive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the Cho@@ colate &apos;s side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ oto ; to define . &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; send the tool@@ bar as compressed t@@ ar archive across &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email , they can secure them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. like every other . &quot;
it &apos;s reasonable when you want to adjust the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. -@@ files on your system . for this , auto@@ conf has a number of options to get to the configure script . in order to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and here not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path before its bin folder lies . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE interface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; was optimized for a rapid web development and combines a well @-@ engineered development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul began to employ with a closer idea : what would be if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; a self @-@ constant , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up language editor would do ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. from now on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; to be the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; well , to the above claim must be de@@ tained that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; developer &apos;s community is based on how someone else has developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; rum@@ or is not only possible all possible , but it allows users and developers to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; allows Web@@ Develop@@ ers to make use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . through the program , they can then expand them &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for a fast web development , and quickly became a well @-@ engineered editor with many powerful functions . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; for more details , documentation is using help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; input , or box help help : / qu@@ anta perform ) . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; is being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ lagoon sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ an@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ an@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file that is not located on it , whereby the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project pre @-@ deposit folder , only a bug is reported . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board , there are special characters to the &amp; HTML ; -@@ note , so that it is displayed correctly and can not be mis@@ understood by the browser as a form@@ atting instruction . &quot;
convert the text from the cli@@ p@@ board into &amp; URL ; -@@ note that is the correct way to insert special characters and space characters in &amp; URL ; s is primarily used for inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s in the anchor day .
switches the block@@ ages to or from . this allows you to select text @-@ sticks with the help of &amp; Shift ; taste .
go directly to a poin@@ ter number . this is very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are available !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the news window on or not . this is the window in which you see the display of scripts and de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; initial and switching of problem problem at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. ; main window is activated , as soon as you switch to the struc@@ turing . &quot;
&quot; displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to put book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu together with the entries of previous or next , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
opens a existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; projects are stored with the file . web@@ pr@@ j .
presenting a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the repository directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files that could be there . that allows e.g. video files into your project folder or sub@@ folder , and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; starting and whether you have downloaded additional input / output modules ( K@@ IO sl@@ aves ) .
settings like &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; the project managed . in the chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. -@@ Projects you will find the details .
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in Project You / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned it to this project .
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialogue to add a new tool@@ bar . that creates just the name . actions must be saved by means of saving actions ... added , or you will be requested when you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . that del@@ etes it from the hard disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( maybe to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar in the next release is available ) . the menu item opens a new e @-@ mail with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; allows the up@@ loading of tool@@ sets to the main server , where every other can access it . see in . &quot;
&quot; download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D , who has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; own description format . &quot;
&quot; loading / refresh the duck from the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; is useful if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be refres@@ hed , without renew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder does not exist , fails the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu includes a list of tags you are present in the currently packed tool@@ bar . if the standard ( HTML ; ) tool tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard , which contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setting dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
activated or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the inser@@ ting by means of tool@@ bar if this day at this place contradic@@ ts the rules .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed under the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click here . click on an activated plug @-@ in disabled . &quot;
sel@@ ects the synthesis @-@ up mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; version .
&quot; select the type of poin@@ ter identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms to the developer . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; through the external application tidy .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . by some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch @-@ up sometimes need time or may cause un@@ fine graphics . recommended , the mapping card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the display in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a selection , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
saves the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; main window at or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog affects every application that use the K@@ HTML , including the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Web@@ browser . &quot;
set the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which you can change and follow the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should generate a help in accordance with the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not yet implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the top of the project , e.g. after filling the project name for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can later be adjusted later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are adjusted later . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering your name file , file will be filled automatically . &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; the project file . by default , it has the name of the project in small letters and without spaces with the enlargement web@@ U@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the repository directory . &quot;
&quot; here you will find the server address of the machine , to which you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ name .@@ Ex@@ .de ) or an IP @-@ address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; lets this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote computer it could be an adjustment . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars can be stored for the project . it is a rel@@ ative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a shared collection of files for different projects is used , this folder should be adjusted instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to include files from local file system into the project . you can choose multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you can download and modify ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , should be integrated . if a project is started anew , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders are displayed within the main folder and you can make an accurate selection of vou@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by typ@@ ing or , by removing the tick , clips from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project wizard includes three settings that simplify your work . these settings can load up in the menu with project properties in the menu profiles up@@ loading , or with the keyboard short@@ cut Shift ; F@@ 7 changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) that are newly ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders .
&quot; supple@@ mentary option to the above , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the projection view , which is loaded when opening the project . can be read more about projection prospects . &quot;
this can be selected to the desired de@@ bu@@ gger . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed is found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plug can be adjusted with the button options . in case the bug search is described .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles can upload high @-@ load profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building supervision for the content of the server for each profile , by drawing up an own building supervision for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window event configuration , you can switch action actions and add these actions to change or delete it . event actions will be executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the Si@@ des of a file . see into the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , we will open &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; the last project , which was open at the moment . &quot;
to open a different project , select Project ... from the menu project or the symbol Project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ stat@@ j as enlargement . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; closed , the project file will automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; changed files . the same happens if you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , however the entries are opening opening and opening with ... in the right mouse button on the menu button : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the upload files . see .
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only a profile is available , the button is cut down to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and remember with program@@ ing . this possibility is useful when frequent loading of files is necessary , and the rather non @-@ secure password on the record can not be placed in question . &quot;
this will stop transferring or simply leave the dialog when you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , many high ratings profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) are up@@ loaded to different servers . when editing or create a profile , this dialog will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the name of the server , to which the files are to be copied . either a full @-@ qualified dom@@ a@@ ame or IP address will work . &quot;
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for transfer . usually , this does not have to be changed except the network administrator does not operate a service to the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is saved on the record , so it can &apos;t be easily read , but anyone with programming experience can easily be seen in the plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only a set of files and tool@@ making . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ sets can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved in the menu project or the project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool tool@@ bar , opened or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , with which one has most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows to adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ t. to your own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above are tool@@ makers in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; best about the menu tool@@ bar . use and add @-@ sets . the addition of tool@@ sets is dealt with down in the section &quot; &quot; Add @-@ tool@@ ing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the machine tool@@ bar and the symbols can be set either using the context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which with new action , a new tool@@ bar can be set out , what actions can be specified in the dialog where actions can be visible on this or other tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action indicated that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the machine tools and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tool set up ... and settings actions can be set .
&quot; templates are essential in the essential document skel@@ et@@ ts , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files to link . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; used templates basically like a common file system with exten@@ sible organization and interfaces . templates have been copied to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; into about the restrictions you imagine for the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; included templates have conditions for their use . please read the terms and conditions set before using the template .
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be any file out of text , i.e. pictures , &amp; PDF ; binary templates are usually included in documents using IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in documents using IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the pre @-@ free tree under global templates . &quot;
&quot; documents can be created from any text document type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally , special rum@@ ors can be found in appropriate sub@@ folders . some examples can be found in the previous tree under global templates . see for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; this kind of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted based on a template , but the same text area is always added again into the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl base . see in for more information about the templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole web sites as templates . they are a collection of different documents organized in a folder structure , summar@@ ized in a zi@@ pped tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul . &quot;
&quot; design a documentation structure for exposure to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file As templates as a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once that is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as a project situation ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the stock @-@ tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template , save the selection as a local / project situation . alternatively , the selection may simply be drawn with dra@@ gging and dra@@ gging on the designs . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a pre @-@ deposit folder . it can be used all file management functions , such as pulling and inser@@ tion or inser@@ ting the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder right in the file tree or in the project files section , select a name for the template and secure it . by default , the project folder is guaranteed , but of course it can be stored as local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ line and foot@@ ers or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create , add files or link with them . in addition , you can keep some things in keeping with templates in projects very profound . &quot;
the basic structure in the sub@@ window designs is based on the files specified in the $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates / Distri@@ anta / templates
&quot; to set the behavior of a folder in the submission overview with the right mouse button on the folder , and select in the context menu properties . the following dialogue appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection field with the three types described above ; files , text or templates . this selection is ab@@ stain@@ ed as soon as el@@ ter@@ al attributes is distorted . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and adap@@ ts to everything except for the regul@@ ators in the pre @-@ supervision . if a regular folder would be dis@@ credited , unless they would be explicitly activated . in the case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ stone . if nothing appears , one is probably in a stem folder . &quot;
&quot; permitted names or copied text for templates in this folder . this could be general Head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all Templ@@ ates for a specific project , enabling copying contents into a folder with special Head@@ lines / foot@@ er a whole presentation already with the appropriate head@@ line / foot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you have a text menu ( shown to show right mouse button ) through a complete instruction collection for adding folders or paste and paste from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; the first mode replaces the code editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second one shares the editing window into two parts : the code text editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : it invites a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or a cursor . then you can edit and switch to the source code in which the changes performed in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be visible in the source code .
&quot; working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . there are no plans to modify this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode is exactly like the first one , except that at the same time the changes are activated in the code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ously is running , this mode is already active , the key shift from one window to the other , whereby the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor can be set up via settings qu@@ anta . in the selection automatically , the recommendation can be adjusted after a click or automatically . basically , the recommendation applies : a small span@@ king for fast calcul@@ ator and a big chip@@ board for slow . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , so the tool@@ sets is possible to choose from . thus , the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will also be called , as soon as a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; this is used to modify : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . one click to the list allows modification of content , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word keywords . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the view@@ points of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons below the list or delete a change about the list is exactly as possible with the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not yet supported .
&quot; it is possible to include an external CSS @-@ style sheet , adding to the file @-@ open button and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , due to the arrows due to the arrows . among rare circumstances the cursor works as usual . text can be inserted through one type , and deleted by means of re@@ plac@@ e@@ taste or removal . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags will be done in the same way about the tool@@ bar , as in the code editor . it &apos;s too noted that the inser@@ ting tags before already available existing tags are not removed , e.g. if an anchor day , surrounded by text , any other surrounding anchor needs to be removed . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ sets like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; work , in this release , the tables or lists must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for investigation of style templates . in contrast to other programs for styles , the search for certain elements is possible and the execution of the sty@@ list can be tr@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; to be able to compile and x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully compile , you need except &amp; k@@ de ; nor the libraries li@@ b@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ bex@@ s@@ lt and li@@ b@@ x@@ ml , which are in a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
&quot; stop in a template , in one place in one of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g downloaded de or x@@ ml file or at the current node . new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in the g@@ db Com@@ pati@@ bility mode , you can set brack@@ et points in a specified file and poin@@ ter number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g follows the complete path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without p@@ ad@@ ress . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top loaded style file name x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is the following input file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible the following input is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a pres@@ age named my@@ ME or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agrees with each my@@ ME , which contains the string template . &quot;
each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; QNAP ME &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the name specified in the X@@ SL &apos;s source file : test 1 &amp; eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test 1
a attached brack@@ et must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and poin@@ t@@ number . this is automatically executed with the loading of the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . half @-@ points are re @-@ reviewed shortly after the start of each cycle .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I have written .
&quot; the compilation had been very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had been made to many changes , and at the same time , another programmer had changed a lot of text simultaneously . the result were numerous conflicts that lead together . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the modified lines , but I could not see what had changed exactly within that line . and there was no indication of the places where maybe only the objection had changed . that &apos;s the result of this change was a small nightmare . &quot;
&quot; thus , this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; there could be differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful features were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board and add it to one of the comparative windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparison , and merge from folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people are working independently of a piece of co@@ ders and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and shows simultaneously the expected result . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files at the same time :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in the folder @-@ assembled :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you need to check with frequently Ko@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white characters and t@@ ul@@ ators are visible . if lines are visible only in a certain number of white signs , one can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble any more , when someone changes . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in one line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can make yourself ease yourself by typ@@ ing the first file by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ 3 Ord@@ inary 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ folder k@@ ho@@ 3 Ord@@ inary 1 Ord@@ inary 2 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ 1 folder @-@ folder
&quot; opening dialog allows the manual type of file names , the selection via the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the list . opening your selection and displays them in the next time . you do not have to leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed . &quot;
&quot; above the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparison will be selected , for B and C , however , use a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A to the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when glu@@ ed together , the input field is actively involved and can be processed . however , it is not absolutely necessary to immediately set an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the comparisons .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison starts immediately . in opening dialog you don &apos;t have to select files , you can simply connect the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use dra@@ gging and pick@@ up : drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and let it fall over a comparison window .
&quot; which thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these features are , it would be a relatively great effort . you need to load only two corresponding files , they &apos;re in &amp; box diff@@ 3 ; you can just copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
note : currently you cannot draw anything out &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only the case of text in a comparison window is supported .
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the pulling and drop of text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and inser@@ tion ) . in such a case , your original data could be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window , the info line from the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the poin@@ ter number of the first visible row in the window . ( note that Windows C is optional . ) E@@ ach Info @-@ line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , leave the mouse a while above the line . then a small aid window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three swelling are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , you can see in the color that file is different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merged ) . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the column @-@ column column . if differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + Z. B. the white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the processor and in a few , rare cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the column @-@ column of the text , is inter@@ sec@@ ted in the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the poin@@ t@@ len@@ nia is activated , the line will be dot@@ ted in the broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the comparison table ) also has an info line with the ins@@ cription : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; changes &#93; if you have dealt the result . usually it contains automatic text already , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons to be found to be found to be found the remaining conflicts ) . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ es are used , each difference is at the same time a conflict which must be solved manually . &quot;
by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows that appears to the line of the group in all windows and the first line of the group will be shown . this group will then be highlighted in the current group . it is highlighted with the color background color for current field and each of the left appears a black beam .
&quot; sometimes , through the automatic transm@@ itter or by manual editing no more line will be left in the group ; it is only a place for the case that you may change your mind and perhaps once again select another source . this text does not appear either in the final stored file , nor in a mark@@ er you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text and lt ; however , in the cli@@ p@@ board , however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board if you copy such text from the window window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if when selecting the sources , ignore the options number , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly done with the scroll and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the windows , Si@@ w like you can also use it from other programs . the passage column beside the vertical panel bar can also be used to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button , you can switch between one @-@ feet and trans@@ cri@@ tically mode . ( pre @-@ set is the single @-@ feed mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the table columns syn@@ ced the view of all windows at the beginning of each group ( as already in the section together and explained the edi@@ table window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( Str@@ g @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ image ) , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ bottom / Str@@ g @-@ Image down@@ wards ) or to the next / previous conflict . therefore , all non @-@ sol@@ dered conflicts continue to be considered conflict . therefore , between sol@@ dered and un@@ solved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you need to copy the Copy -@@ button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ tion ) . if this option is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , as you might write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board acci@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; poin@@ ter will be stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a poin@@ ter notes \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use car re@@ tool@@ box \ \ r \ . K@@ de@@ 3 keeps the poin@@ ter of source files not at , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use with binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved and restored to the next start . ( menu inser@@ ting - &gt; K@@ de@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog is also using variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are displayed in short notice . if the chosen font does not support this display , does not happen at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form , but would be activated . on these systems , the button pres@@ ets automatically represents an odd color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the button of the tablet button is inserted into the respective number of spaces . otherwise , a t@@ ator @-@ sign is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you enter your input or return , the default line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the cli@@ p@@ board . manually copy the manual into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which poin@@ ter type you prefer to store . the pre @-@ set value is the generally usual selection on the operating system used .
&quot; while using files it tries &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs may not be ignored . also , the white characters are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a wagon sign &apos; \ &apos; and one poin@@ ter result &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others , but then could handle models with different sizes in the side @-@ to @-@ side comparison , but then they could be disabled in different sizes . during this option , this option must be disabled . in the default , this option is disabled . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; &apos; - &apos; ) ignored . in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . changes in comments will be treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; intensive search for even smaller differences . the option is activated in the default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atically St@@ opping mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict will continue . &quot;
sol@@ ves automatically all conflicts in white signs by selecting the chosen file as a source . ( pre @-@ set is manual selection . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in numbers or comments when the options are selected or ignor@@ es C / C + + comments .
&quot; these options are dealt with in the chapter on the scanning of folders and break@@ through@@ s . look for details under documentation to the directory , comparison and inter@@ mer@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is attached .@@ ori@@ g . if already there is such a back@@ up@@ file named the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without any further backup . &quot;
fits the language of user interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you have to finish &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; end and restart so that the change is active in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language there is global over the control center . )
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; above the selection fields for the enco@@ ding appears a short notice what the local co@@ ding is . ( this cannot be changed here , and has purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters should be treated and interpre@@ ting . since the enco@@ ding for each file is individually adjustable , can even be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can set up what co@@ ding is to be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , they may not be working with your co@@ dec . ( e.g. , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only be used with 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option you can specify the code of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
disable this to sup@@ press the high@@ s of changes in white characters in the text or check@@ box . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a colour co@@ ded column column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B ; -@@ gt ; C is displayed next to the normal nor a second super @-@ column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . bl@@ ends you simply the less important window . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
orders the comparison window side by side or over@@ head . this can also be useful for viewing long lines . ( this option is located in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes you consider the differences and then opt out ab@@ rup@@ tly , the files collap@@ sed . a simple click starts the compilation and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as pre @-@ given name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the file again , then the name of the last used file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass on to this external command . in &amp; box diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own processor that matches your own requirements . you can use this function e.g. to trim disrup@@ ting parts or to correct penetration . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is given first to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is specified first ( see above ) , then the issue of the command is specified only when poin@@ ter is used . you can write your own processor that matches your own requirements . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow the user more flexibility in setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; use this for@@ ging command for dra@@ gging in order to convert the input into the upper case : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ \ ( . \ \ \ ) refers to the found text in the first brack@@ et string . \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in large letters . &quot;
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to add automatically generated string . * \ \ \ &apos; s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might start to understand it and perhaps you might think these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ de@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre @-@ processing command for pointing down@@ right . sed &apos; s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , so everyone will be replaced by nothing , so virtually er@@ ased . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several requirements at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions from one another . example :
&quot; instead of sed , you can also use something different such as per@@ l . per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / Cre@@ ating / switches &apos; However , with per@@ l some details differently . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) requires per@@ l only ( and ) without the defined &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data according to the normal pre @-@ processor will be retained for viewing and conver@@ gence . further operations only change the data , which sees the poin@@ t@@ len@@ ght @-@ Al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you use a normal pre@@ defined processor , the poin@@ ter code provides the output of the normal pre@@ code as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simul@@ ate the simul@@ ated and shows the simul@@ ated changes without doing them really ;
... &quot; select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
&quot; this is very similar to the comparison , and merge single files very similar . you only need to open the folder on the command line or in the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; when three folders are assembled , folder 1 is used as a base . if no target sub@@ folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as target folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , do not compile it . to start together , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 button . ( further details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during reading the folder you will notify you a little news window about current progress . if you break scanning the folder , only the files are listed until then were compared . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder of the scan found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can choose an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
the folder structure is usually folded up . you can click a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object double or by clicking the arrow buttons on the left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories and all sub@@ directories can be applied to all the folders and folders .
&quot; if you double click on a file , the file will start off and it appears as a comparison window . &quot;
the symbol in the column name reflects the data type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the data type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the detailed window to the selected object . in such a case the contrac@@ tion @-@ hr action cannot be automatically selected . if this will be started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , are used in the columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; with identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered as identical if their entire content is identical . then also folders the same color . with folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... A , B and C do not have the same type of data ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file is ) : errors : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this may not run together . &quot;
... A and B does not have the same type of data ( e.g. when A is a folder and B a file is ) : errors : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , this may not run together . &quot;
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active , if only two folders and no explicit target sub@@ folders were specified and if the option directories are pro@@ active . then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action is identical , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : assemble and save the result into both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ame for the output file only B ; Right to the merged file only B ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are assembled and the option re@@ vert file will be selected , then analyzed &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such mistakes are not fixed , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; you will perform one file after another . you state Status column displays skills when the collap@@ sed successfully , and according to other messages if something was completed , you should check out a final review and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; when in the furnishing dialog the file @-@ method full analysis is chosen , K@@ de@@ 3 further columns will display . these contain the number of un@@ ison , sol@@ dered , not white and white conflicts . ( the column for sol@@ dered conflicts will only be displayed when three folder are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the just selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all inter@@ connection actions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can run it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have any target folder , then in the three folder mode , it will be used as target , in the two folder folder , B as the target is chosen and the synchron@@ ize is used A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a target folder , please check if all entries should be displayed in the target folder . there are several options to be displayed in the folder structure . check these options to avoid un@@ favorable surprises : &quot;
to assemble all entries : select directory assemb@@ ling / continue in the directory -@@ menu or press F@@ 7 ( the keyboard short@@ cut ) . to run only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if the conflic@@ ting dat@@ atyp@@ es will still exist together , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialogue window appears with the options circul@@ ating , simul@@ ate and break down . &quot;
&quot; choose Shi@@ pped , if you would like to see what would happen without which really changes will be made . you will then get a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then leads certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( merge a single file ) , then a composite window opens ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished using a file , select again directories will start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not yet saved , a corresponding dialogue appears . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to a mistake , a message appears and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will find some error messages that will help you to select the cause of the problem . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before proceeding with the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were assembled individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and takes them later together . even if this has been compiled or not saved , these entries are considered to be done . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be assembled once again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ de@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory assemb@@ ling with these options :
&quot; only files that match the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; separate space holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default setting is * . folder must not match this pattern . &quot;
&quot; files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild @-@ holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders corresponding to this pattern are not displayed in the elementary tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild @-@ holder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that are also ignored by CVS . the great advantage is that this folder can be set specifically with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files , files have an agent attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a single poin@@ t. is marked as hidden . this option lets you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the Element@@ tree or not . this option is switched on the default . &quot;
&quot; on links to files : when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in the default . &quot;
&quot; on links to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links will be treated as normal folders and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; cras@@ hes on possible recur@@ sions . ) This option is off in the default . &quot;
&quot; results in full analysis of each file and displays statistics columns . ( the number of sol@@ vent , un@@ ison , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) The complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and substantially slower if it is applied to files that contain no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern ) . &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folder via a long @-@ lasting network , it may cost faster , only the chan@@ ts date and the file size . however , this speed board cost you a certain degree of security . please be careful with caution . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; similarly as confidential for the date of change . there is no real comparison instead of . the files are considered as identical , when copying the change from the date . please be used with caution . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; activated the sync mode , when two folders are compared and no target sub@@ folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions are to be assembled . also the results are stored in both folders . this option is switched off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is considered uncertain as it is assumed that the other file is not changed too . you should check this in any case . ) This option is off in the default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced by another or deleted , the original version is ren@@ amed and gets deleted .@@ orig@@ ines . if an old backup file is deleted with the .@@ ori@@ g extension . this also affects the normal merge single files , not just the merged folder . this option is enabled in the default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder @-@ conver@@ ters should be visible by single files ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to switch the window directory &amp; text window , you can switch the main window in window menu and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file simply using double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a single file in the same menu . once you save the result , the status will be set to be done and the file will not be assembled once you launch the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you want to re @-@ read the directory again : list -@@ menu : new &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO sl@@ aves . K@@ de@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open on local or remote computers .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP @-@ server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a zi@@ pped archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should consider :
&quot; a path can be relative . or .. contained . that is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank records &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes using the protocol you used . it follows a short list of constraints : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder is displayed . then , a file is accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change of change . therefore the per@@ missions or change from the original date . ( note that the option is familiar to the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
&quot; the main purpose of purpose is currently as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first ever starts the built @-@ in differences . to start K@@ de@@ 3 , press the right mouse button on the differences viewer and then select In K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; usually required &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a tile , takes &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of original files from the patch file . then starts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch has to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ de@@ 3@@ Part , please note that if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since generating the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the equivalent of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . this is not supported , or the same of folders is not supported in the box mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ de@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist it comp@@ are ) there are already . also the name K@@ de@@ 3 already indicates that it can bring together as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs quite long and have learned a lot by watching into the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who have gone this path or go to this way .
&quot; you have compiled the program from the sources and the configure script should not be given the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default installed configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you can find further information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white signs is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; but if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line will be treated as not identical . if the lines are next to each other , this sequence is , but this is the case , this is the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers every difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this important information is however lost , if the result is simply stored as a text file and it is much effort to create extra a private file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort to do so far has been too big . you can always restore a specific version by selecting a source A / B / C . to process larger quantities of text should be used by other editor .
&quot; after removing the text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c lin@@ t , and the text does not delete itself . what does this mean and how can this be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; used already many colors to highlight of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and lacking the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new .
information on how to use K@@ de@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Qu@@ etz@@ og file in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; install and install , use the command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system , installed in K@@ DE . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf@@ ers and autom@@ aker used , you should not have any problems during comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ mail@@ ing@@ lists . &quot;
cutting ( Str@@ g @-@ X or Exten@@ sive removal ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ V or Exten@@ sive inser@@ tion ) add the text from the cli@@ p@@ board at the current curr@@ y position or replaces the current mark .
&quot; only differences indicate : files that are identical in all folders , do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the target folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current version of the program version , you must update the folder with the function actu@@ alizing . ) &quot;
&quot; there are only entries displayed , the differences show . that also performs that identical files are not already copied in the target sub@@ folders . if the target sub@@ folders these files does not already contain , they are missing after the folder . ( the behavior will be changed in a later program version . ) This option is off in the default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons on the selection of the source with cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the appropriate window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the window window ( if the lines are already present ) , they will be back on the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in the default , this option is disabled . under@@ differences in each character ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; shows a thumb@@ nail of all virtual desktop surfaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the desktop surfaces to change their size , finish it or shift them . this works both within a desktop @-@ surface as well as at several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the running applications , and the applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a desktop and on other areas of work . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is clicked , when on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the context menu has only been clicked on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; if however , on an application within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; however , the symbol and the name of the application and the entries are minim@@ izing , maxim@@ ise , on the desktop and the end . the commands do the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izing the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; this cross @-@ field indicates , you can move windows within the &amp; box ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other desktop surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the name of the virtual desktop surfaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; crossing this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the numbers of virtual desktop surfaces . it is covered together with name , the names with Ord@@ inary numbers are provided , &amp; eg ; 1st floor space . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each work@@ space is also displayed as a background in the background . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs are displayed as a small window in the &amp; k@@ p@@ camp ; otherwise , only the empty work@@ space will be displayed to enable them to choose from . &quot;
here is the view of the program window selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . symbol shows the window with its standard symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the real programme . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will appear : classic leaves &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n @-@ aster , known from P@@ ager applications in some other windows , wa@@ ver@@ tically displays all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizontal range , which is very well suited for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager mini @-@ program in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can be modified in the size , displaying the windows as symbols or with their content and can move beyond the control panel . &quot;
right @-@ click within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent extrac@@ ting switch settings ... lets the dialog settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog settings . but you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ amed c with any text editor , such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you do not login to the file , you must register as a user @-@ administrator or login to your system administrator . in this file you must enter the key @-@ do@@ w@@ ling fashion and add value to it . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE @-@ Basic package . &quot;

&quot; it may be a screen lu@@ pe . you can enlarge with &amp; box ; a part of the screen will enlarge . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , Web @-@ designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; cold . &quot;
&quot; it is a very powerful application , which is constantly enhanced with new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; when you &amp; box ; start , a window appears as above . the main window of the screen , displays the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a window window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting &amp; box , the area around the mouse @-@ cursor like a moving lens . alternatively , you can provide a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( drop @-@ in mode ) or the environment of the mouse @-@ cursor at the screen ( eg ; on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window will be displayed , select the mouse cursor . please note that &apos;s not able to detect the form of the mouse cursor . this is always the standard box ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse @-@ cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button down , so you can einf@@ alls the content of the enlargement window and move it with the arrows . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift ; taste press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
with this combination you can change the size of the drop @-@ window . note that the upper left corner of the drop @-@ stand remains fixed and only the lower right corner is to move .
&quot; has a lot of features . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy into a file , to add it into other applications ( to add it later to other applications ) , turning the picture and much more . &quot;
starts or stops the update of the display . the t@@ opp@@ en of the update causes that the required CPU time is against 0 .
&quot; choose the actu@@ alization rate ( Very low , low , means , high , Very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window appears . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; you automatically use your provided short @-@ command to save files , opening a new window , print , no@@ vices ( with the button document again download in the &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and cl@@ ei@@ vers &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you can also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a screen lu@@ pe . you can use a screen to enlarge in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from research che@@ ating or artist to web@@ designer or visual handic@@ apped persons . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is distorted a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer at the R@@ SI syndrome ( repeti@@ tive @-@ ray @-@ in @-@ stage syndrome ) and those of each mouse @-@ click pains . &quot;
&quot; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates one mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is distorted a while on the same place . it is meant to help people who em@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and where every mouse @-@ click pain is prepared . however , this requires a little practice . &quot;
&quot; can handle pain caused by clicking the mouse and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you may also be suffering because of your computer with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it once again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pain help helps to be caused by clicking with the mouse , it is against pain caused by filling the mouse , useless . and as with all the ergonomic means : the result can vary for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads one mouse click away as soon as you break the movement shortly .
&quot; is the intelligent move activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a break after it is done the pressures of the mouse . move now the mouse , just wa@@ its to the end of the motion , before the det@@ achment takes a little practice , but you quickly get used to it quickly . &quot;
this sof@@ tening time must be pet@@ ri@@ dden after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; one mouse click .
&quot; intelligent reloc@@ ating is enabled , the turn@@ around is active ( 1 / 10 s ) active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after downloading the mouse is waiting , before the mouse button is getting rid of the mouse , if there is no effect on the mouse . &quot;
&quot; and k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; now supports click through mouse shifting . if this function is enabled , one click on the right and back , followed by a break , one click with the right mouse button . one long way back to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements will be started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool . the first time will be started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can shor@@ ten the reaction time ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound Pu@@ ffer to shor@@ ten you at a lower value in order to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , is marked &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; at any start by &amp; k@@ de ; it is currently only available under &amp; k@@ de ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please make sure to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; setting all settings back to the values that were set when opening the dialog . have you already applied the button , the settings will be applied to the state after the latest pressures . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; initially with the preferences . in particular , the intelligent lifting should you first be switched off . if you then click to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , if necessary , it is necessary to reduce the answer times by &amp; k@@ de ; by sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse @-@ click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which does not represent a link , do not lead to un@@ seen reactions . you can therefore park the mouse on such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse is printed , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you will not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; first , you must take out the mouse ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse differently . however , it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily shor@@ ten with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system breaks the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if you just started a failure . if you &apos;re in this case the intelligent shift , means that &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation no longer can finish by the slo@@ wing of the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; under a different window manager use and shift a window .
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you yourself perform a mouse click . here , the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool is reset , and you can continue to work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : when you enter text , try &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to run mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another location . &quot;
&quot; solution : use mouse to place the cursor up there , where you want to have it . but do not park the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you are unable to produce a ke@@ ystro@@ kes . safe zones for the mouse @-@ cursor are un@@ prepared reactions . thus , the gray areas for the mouse @-@ cursor are free &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the front lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with smart shifting , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; intelligent reloc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very well possible to copy it into the cli@@ p@@ board or move again , or any other action in which you want to move the mouse in an pressing mouse button . however , there will probably be some advice on them : &quot;
&quot; use the intelligent moving not , if you just start using &amp; mou@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; select text instead as follows : run at the one end of the text field and hold the switch @-@ down button down , while you move the mouse @-@ cursor to the other end of the text and click the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; by doing it , every time you use the audi@@ ble mouse button ; the mouse buttons presses a sound like a mouse @-@ click . so you know exactly when in the smart shifting time begins . later you can use the intelligent shifting even without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , it requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Win@@ dow ; it should be the case on most system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has sound card and speakers and are correctly furnished .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse button as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short for@@ war@@ p . this program was developed for people who suffer the R@@ SI syndrome and whom the actu@@ ation of the per@@ sever@@ est pain is prepared . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a certain time waiting for a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is released . in this way the pulling and dra@@ gging with the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; mouth : is a program , with the mu@@ te user can let their computers speak for themselves . &quot;
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; you can let mu@@ te users talk the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the list of propositions which are to be discussed again .
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) , enter the command later used for the voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furniture . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text device . from the text device books you can often choose text passages without having to type them . the text passages can be edited naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third side ( right scre@@ enshot ) you define the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . in addition , you can specify the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can read the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . in addition , you can only read the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly arranged and contains essentially a input field for the ke@@ ystro@@ kes of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a distor@@ tion of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white box in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you have c@@ mouth ; right , you can enter in the input field the sentences you want to hear . each spoken proposition is attached to the per@@ imeter memory . you can select from it propositions which are to be talked once again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings box , setup ... open the settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two mapping cards , voice @-@ over@@ s and settings , the page Wor@@ ter@@ ing and the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the diamond card , you enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ field under the input field you specify the string code , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; mouth @-@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the cross @-@ field , if the text is to be shared as default on the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the cross @-@ field is not selected , the text is shared as a parameter . you can use the following space holder to use : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice @-@ output depends on your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation on your language generator . examples of this can be found in the App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; to use as speech service as a language service , &amp; k@@ mouth ; as the first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the further settings on this page are available and currently being developed in SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection of action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by keyboard short@@ cut or by choosing a text passage in the menu text pass@@ age@@ book or in the bar for text pass@@ agen@@ das . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of instant reviews , the chosen text passage is directly talked and added in addition to the storage area . with selecting from In the input field , the selected text passage will only be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection of the editing pane for text pass@@ agen@@ das , you can specify whether the text agent can be saved automatically when using the editing window . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of text pass@@ age@@ book , the book is stored . if you choose changes , the text password is not saved . select before saving , will &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text agent is to be saved . &quot;
&quot; the page Wor@@ ter@@ s@@ lement contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection field , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this drop @-@ field you can choose the currently used dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add the sequence of books or export them to a file . below the list you can set the name and in the selection field the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads then the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation . the frequency of individual words is simply determined by billing of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the list of words with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , in order to add properly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; this option allows you to merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks , which dic@@ tion@@ aries are summar@@ ised , and how this wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you place a new , empty dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new entered words automatically into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ agen@@ books is double @-@ divided . in the upper part the text file books are represented as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated short@@ cut . if you have selected a text agent , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or selected text passages and books , you can either reach either the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via an up @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order of text passages or text passages , by pulling the mouse to the new location or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; -@@ key . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the run @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field , a text section is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected areas of the run @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; the currently active sentence is spoken . if the text is located in the input field , this is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the run @-@ storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is displayed with buttons for frequently used commands , the tool@@ bar is arranged by default on the editing window directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left @-@ hand side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is noted , a narrow bar at the bottom of the main window is displayed with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not closing , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is displayed , a postpon@@ able le@@ list for text pass@@ agen@@ das will be displayed directly under the tool@@ bar . by clicking on the left @-@ hand side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; probably you have not entered the command for the voice @-@ issue correctly or not completely entered . open Settings box , open the page General Settings and enter the command for the voice @-@ issue on the car@@ et@@ card voice . ( see settings dialog for language profi@@ ci@@ ers to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a voice @-@ issue of the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ tically supported . the license allows to use festival for free and without restrictions on sale . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the adjustment of the language issue , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival . the command to voice @-@ output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is one in &amp; Java ; at present , he only supports the English language . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS for free and without restriction on restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for the establishment of the language issue , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . language edition is possible with one of the three following instruction examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed@@ ding , so you need an additional program to use the text in phon@@ eme . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text in ph@@ on@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , under the assumption that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to get the last character of the text so that an additional character must be added . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / debit / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp /
all parts of the command must be written in a line . the option data is to be sent as default .
&quot; the speech D@@ lam@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further language service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various language output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the adjustment of the language @-@ generators is carried out only in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as kt@@ ts@@ d as language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD @-@ language service , which appears in the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successful to use , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; needs about 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; mouth @-@ mouth ; is an application , with the people that can not let the text display , text by the machine . it is saved a list already sal@@ ted sets , which can be used again and again . &quot;

&quot; the mapping card orders is only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD has been launched . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the mapping card and cross @-@ screen ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed web page . then check the text that should be read , and select in the main menu tools text read . after a short time the language output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to highlight the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; -@@ pr@@ elo@@ ad and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; K@@ ate ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can submit text read . then check the text that should be read , and select in the main menu tools text read . then the voice should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works , if &amp; K@@ ate is embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; par@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which will notify you of you of the specified events . you can read the text of these messages also by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in conversation , the IR@@ C program of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set different types of messages . you can be notified when in an IR@@ C channel , you can notify you if in a IR@@ C channel , you can then read the IR@@ C messages . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ not@@ fy , appears a menu entry in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ not@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; filter for drawing up a good opportunity in &amp; store ; incorrect or wrong to correct messages . it is a good example . it removes the tags and b from the news , the K@@ mail and also the expression / local / In@@ box , since it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filter are one of the advanced capabilities of t@@ kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filter is not required .
&quot; in Fil@@ ters , text is edited , before he is sent to the program @-@ speech at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to select false words or abbrevi@@ ations , select a matching language and speaker or to deal with certain defects of voice iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Sa@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be held to all other orders and holds this orders . if the edition of the screen reader is pre @-@ read , the challenged orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after the warning output .
&quot; messages have the next priority priority . a message dis@@ closes normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that can read messages . while you are &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site , you can welcome you with &amp; k@@ mouth . read someone who is just the room . &amp; k@@ de ; noti@@ fications are also news . read about it . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text entries . each order you encounter from the car@@ p card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text entries are intended for the issue of longer texts , which have no special urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four orders are processed in queue , except the issuing of screen readers . if an application sends the output of a screen Re@@ aders , during &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre@@ reads , this issue will be stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to regular warnings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ News . &quot;
filter edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are running as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
string sub@@ sets replace parts of a text by other text . the app@@ alling parts can be delivered either as words or as regular expressions ; it is supplied with pre@@ defined strings as follows : - ) by text or for re@@ forming messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; mail ; in a better understanding .
&amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) around &amp; XML ; are included in a format by a format to a different format . included in SS@@ ML are included in the package .
&quot; with spre@@ aders you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program , which is sent to the text . if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can be read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , which he is applied to a voice @-@ issue . if the filter is fixed that its rules will not apply , there will be the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; conc@@ ise ; sent out , it is processed by all activated filters on the page below . editing the filter is made in the order from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the designed normal filters . if a filter is not listed , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be dra@@ gged down from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of the filter , and it will display the following furniture di@@ alogs below . &quot;
&quot; for the installation of character programs , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding substitute text . large and small spelling is not considered by comparison . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . this name can you choose according to any number , it just has to distinguish from the names of the other filters . &quot;
&quot; this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column , and replaces him in accordance with the string of column . the list is processed from top to bottom . &quot;
click here to post@@ p@@ one the distinctive word or regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save or delete the current list . download a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language listed here , the filter is applied only when the spokes@@ person speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you click the mouse click the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; button down . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter will only be applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : con@@ vers@@ ation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID @-@ ID programs will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you need to leave we@@ eds . if for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ator ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be shown copies . &quot;
&quot; the template filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the cast@@ or filter if match . all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared to words , the string composition filter regul@@ arity in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be limited by divi@@ ders ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular press , you can call it in the di@@ alogs adding or edit as help to make this expressions . the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; -@@ Re@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such conver@@ sions . it can only be applied on shap@@ ely XML . however , the aid program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the ambient variable path is also sufficient x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker filter you can send texts to a specific speaker , which is set up on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can choose for example that texts should be read by k@@ mail from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text on the filters over@@ comes , there is a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program proposes that the text is available , and the characteristics of the speaker available on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card speaker are selected . with the speaker filter you can write the chosen spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; here is a value registered , the filter is applied in case the text is applied , in case the text entered the regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular press , you can access it with a click on the button to get aid in the input . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the characteristics of the filter conditions specified by you . if the text is met at the top of the filter conditions , the speaker is selected , who corresponds to the desired requirements . click on the button on the right to display the dialog language selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your speaker settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the inter@@ op@@ tionally filter is applied only to the text when all conditions with an entry in the box , apply filters when you apply . you need to enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the VO API , of &amp; k@@ de ; , with the programmers able to lend their applications T@@ TS abilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module , with the language profi@@ ci@@ izer to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , allowing you to use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; -@@ interface of the language version API of &amp; k@@ de ; the full documentation for both AP@@ Is are available on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications demand voice services over the &amp; D@@ Bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; here is text of the text for reading and option a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are more commands you can use for a list of all commands .
&quot; open two &amp; console ; -@@ window . run only frac@@ ts@@ d in one window , then k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language profi@@ ci@@ ers support my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Per@@ former@@ filter , but when using the module for festival websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to a mistake in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able does not work at all . so , you must do it yourself if you &apos;re not installed the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c and find the ambient variable path . &quot;
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation appear to cause errors in the synthes@@ izer , so whole sentences is printed or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , ensure that the option dra@@ ko@@ ding is adjusted to the correct value for the appropriate language . there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be corrected by a string composition filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; speech Disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses a customiz@@ able module @-@ architecture for language profi@@ ci@@ ers . if you want to expand for use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; -@@ conver@@ gence filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt install install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile and compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( Version 3.4 or newer ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; speech @-@ dispens@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you purchase the source text files from the source file , from the source file , or download the Tar@@ ball up to date , install and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you or kt@@ ts ; use first , check if speech Disp@@ at@@ cher works correctly with your voice , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is to be further developed so that the program of speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is dis@@ assembled in individual sentences . the user may withdraw , repeat , repeat the output or break off . &quot;
&quot; when an application is text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; it can request an application for example a female English speaker . if you have appointed a speaker , whose language English and whose sex is feminine , this is used , otherwise , the most suitable speaker is chosen . if you want to know more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; write a speaker , look inside . &quot;
&quot; when you click on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card speaker to Add , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit@@ but@@ ton@@ . as an example , the display of the module for Festival Interactive will be displayed . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to Festival is included in the path , you just need to enter a festival area . &quot;
&quot; select the string code for text that is handed over to Festival . for voices that are handed down to Festival . generally speaking , Western languages are using ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliding players make volume , intercom speed and sound @-@ height of the synthetic language . if you can not select some regul@@ ators and this grey will be displayed , the voice you choose not to use these settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be loaded on account of their size several seconds . if you mark this cross @-@ field , these voices are already loaded into the start by K@@ TT@@ SD so ( on a larger memory consumption ) the first set is more quickly syn@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; if this cross @-@ field can not be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; this entry is marked when starting from k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr , the program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the icon k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; this entry field is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area , as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this gives you the possibility to read or otherwise control it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders listed in queue , along with the application , which has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the just edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the cardboard card . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can buy sat@@ bil@@ ise in the order that is selected in the list below , pre@@ - or returned . ( but not every job consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click OK , all changes of settings ( also on the other car@@ p cards ) are taken over and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to show the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the mapping audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text entries are listed and managed . issues of Screen Sa@@ a@@ ders , warnings and messages are not shown . for more information about the communication types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component can not be selected , or kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding Audi@@ om@@ o@@ du@@ l or t@@ kt@@ ts ; the necessary libraries cannot load . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de is to be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules can be displayed in the list , you have to select at least one module , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; make the microphone speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ cm ; % roughly the double normal microphone speed . thus , these settings can be implemented , the program must be so@@ x installed . &quot;
click to apply the new settings for the running &amp; product ; -@@ System .
the list of al@@ sa equipment comprises all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you will need to find out which device works with you . in doubt you choose standard .
&quot; on this map , you can set specific actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Sa@@ a@@ ders has the highest priority . it will be held to all other orders and holds this orders . after the output of the screen reader has been read , the challenged orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have priority the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor becomes too hot . a warning holds the output of messages and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; news have the next priority . a message dis@@ closes normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you want to read a long text on a web page , you can welcome with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless meet someone who is just the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen Re@@ aders , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio version into the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played then , when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active as well as introduc@@ tory message , the introduc@@ tory sound is played prior to the introduc@@ tory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this paper card apply only to normal text entries . for messages , warnings and issues of Screen Sa@@ a@@ ders there are no special promotions , if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read by &amp; kt@@ oria ; K@@ not@@ fy messages to be read , start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr and click on noti@@ fications . the mapping card notices appears . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field , to read the reading of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ discrimination . if this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and t@@ kt@@ ts ; reads no aler@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; if this attitude is highlighted , noti@@ fications , where a sound is played , by &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list or delete it . if you click on the button Add , there appears a dialog where you can choose the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone is mentioned in an IR@@ C message your nickname . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which in the list nothing else is indicated , are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
use this selection field to set what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do if an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected the text @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following space holder to use : &quot;
&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired language device . standard select the speaker , which is shown in the list on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card narr@@ ator as top @-@ to @-@ top entry . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action for all other events of the particular application is executed . as the last possibility comes the action to carry out the action under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the following noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button save to load the settings for noti@@ fications in a file . use the button shop to load stored settings from a file . if you want to start with an empty list , click Dele@@ te . all entries are deleted . all entries are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to highlight text for a voice @-@ issue . this standard contains marks for the control of voices , the speaker speed , the volume of voice and pitch . also marks for controlling the pron@@ unciation by example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you need to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) , since this is the default , the festival is used in the SS@@ ML issue . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pick@@ up in the festival @-@ configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ cm ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE , Public &quot; - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis / m@@ is@@ .@@ d@@ t@@ d &quot; &gt; Who has slept in my bed ? asked Mama B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked the B@@ ären@@ child . &#93; &#93; &gt; &quot;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and typ@@ ho@@ beam filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . SB@@ Ds are required , because only the first set has to be syn@@ ced , not the whole text order . thus you can also stop or stop or stop , even if the voice leaves this not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional group filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up as a pro@@ filing filter filter . you can change their settings or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters , starting from it . &quot;
&quot; in the simplest way , you will learn the setup of the language selection by selecting . switch off the text selection , change the speaker selection and check how the selection of the speaker is changing . therefore , you need to have set up more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is un@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; then faster with the pre@@ reading can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last for a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can stop or cancel the text orders at the cardboard card orders , even if the voice leaves this function not supported . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional group filter is automatically set up when you start k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . change anything about this filter , unless you know what you do . &quot;
pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular code ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( temporary code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional limits ( t@@ abl@@ ation characters ) are automatically removed from the text ) . note that the standard pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filters are maintained .
&quot; SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; news , warnings , messages or the output of screen readers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from Ver@@ see the normal pro@@ sec@@ tional group filter , you can insert it again by loading the _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the map selection , you can write the speaker settings for the application . the car@@ p card will be displayed if &quot;
use of the default speaker ( the top one on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card speaker ) . in other words : there are no inter@@ viewer properties set .
&quot; using the most suitable intercom device , which displays all the features of a furnished speaker . if you do not delete or edit the configuration of the speaker , choose this speaker ; otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker from which is most reserved to the original properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method of entering the desired spre@@ aders , by clicking on one of the selections . &quot;
&quot; select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , enter nothing . &quot;
&quot; select this cross @-@ field , if the property should prevail over other properties . you can also set several mark@@ ers here . &quot;
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as a prime property . you &apos;ll want to use this property rarely . the only case you may need to specify that a particular application text in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field speaker , who is closest to the following , click the &quot; &quot; Copy &quot; &quot; button and then use the speaker , which corresponds with the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the entry 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr cras@@ hes immediately when it started . I have to compile Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get back tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is cras@@ hed and pointed ; it was completed . probably you have to register G@@ ST register . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not resolved , possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer is not resolved . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio version above Al@@ sa does not work when I play music at the same time . when I keep a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears , which states : &quot; to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts occur at al@@ sa , which prevent an simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . notes for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ Book@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I have loaded one additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I have installed it and can use it in festival , but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr shows that voice not . &quot;
&quot; add to the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / add the new voice . as guidance , you can use the other entries . if this is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the mapping audio there is a setting speed . so this works , the program must be so@@ x installed and accessible via the ambient variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive provide a setting for speed . depending on your chosen voice is this active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the intercom speed are ignored , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; ( this is because you are completely gr@@ aced by the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite gr@@ ace@@ fully , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML , and set the microphone speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t make it that web pages are read with a female voice . I have set a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 , the Day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . so the festival does not produce mistakes , re@@ jects the x@@ s@@ l file to convert SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the Gender @-@ Tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a own string composition filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no longer sat@@ d - or go back . on the car@@ rot orders is displayed just out of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( point , cargo , comm@@ uting , comm@@ a and semi @-@ col@@ on ) must not be fil@@ tered . use for these signs instead a filter for the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflicts in the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously stop music and then start a text . &amp; # 8217 ; free@@ zes also if you can stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions to this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with stand July 2005 a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you have a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet again . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the intercom speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the command apt install install . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as tar@@ ball ( with tar @-@ packed archive ) , sign up as normal users and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

&quot; the following modules for language profi@@ ci@@ ers are created by default . some of them possess a tre@@ ad@@ dictions of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the guidelines of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . the column configure option to cut off the configure parameters , which causes the move parameters . &quot;
&quot; as default , it is specified as default , in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . this folder is not listed in the ambient variable $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR@@ S , you need to specify as an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you or kt@@ ts ; use first , check if your language works correctly works correctly . follow the instructions that you have obtained with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is revealed . the quality of voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . with many voices you can set volume , microphone speed and pitch @-@ height . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help them find in the instructions that will be supplied with festival . do you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions on the transfer . &quot;
&quot; this voice uses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or a new one . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in festival / lib / IP / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian / Russian . select a ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic ( 8 @-@ Bit@@ - ) enco@@ ding like for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; - distri@@ butions as first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option code must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Ky@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
Festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; synthes@@ izer takes over the le@@ x@@ ology analysis and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates the audio version . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes can be downloaded by
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from Di@@ ph@@ on files . you need additional software to create these Di@@ phone . Festival required by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also generate from German texts Di@@ phone . more information can be found under .
&quot; with this procedure , additional Wr@@ apper code is added to Festival , to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes for language synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; file files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ folder , but in the folder festival / lib / . instructions can be found under &quot;
I@@ MS German Festival is a changing version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ votes . required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival of
&quot; instructions can be found in the file RE@@ AD@@ ME in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the inser@@ ting of the error correction is not required , you just need to translate one festival ) . add the following lines into the file festival / lib / sit@@ es@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; voice location &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you have to edit the / etc / fes@@ tival@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German votes . replace the right path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . currently , the correct path will work in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . currently , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German festival . &quot;
&quot; this method uses special code to specify the language about the festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and install first Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure they both function . then download Festival @-@ Czech &quot;
un@@ zip the program with tar to a suitable folder and create the dictionary . the exec@@ utable file festival must lie in your path .
download the voice @-@ file cz@@ 2 from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder .

&quot; Lite Lite is a free , qu@@ el@@ ist language , who currently supports only a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with even sufficient stimul@@ ant quality . with &amp; t@@ kt@@ ts ; you can either get a single @-@ height , volume or tuning speed with this language . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; search engines therefore first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; H@@ adi@@ fix is a two @-@ step guide , which works with di@@ ph@@ ones . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o translated from it the sound . language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , microphone speed , and volume over k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr . &quot;
&quot; download at least a German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ page and un@@ zip them with un@@ zip into the folder / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the file . &quot;
on the car@@ p menu device select a voice and make the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correctly .
&quot; E@@ pos is a free , qu@@ el@@ ist language , for the Czech and Slov@@ ak language . it is a simple language synthes@@ izer with even sufficient stimul@@ ant quality . with &amp; t@@ kt@@ ts ; you can only use the volume using this language . &quot;
&quot; start k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr . on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card speaker click Add . select the Czech or Slov@@ ak language and E@@ pos T@@ TS @-@ language courses . if the E@@ pos programs do not enter your path , enter the path to the programs on the Kar@@ tei@@ Card narr@@ ator . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter a &amp; console ; E@@ pos -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ ist language , which was written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can adjust neither ton@@ ing , volume or speed . &quot;
&quot; the commands mode ou@@ du@@ l allows you to use &amp; store ; with any voice , which can be controlled in a &amp; console ; on the command line . &quot;
&quot; the best use one command to write the voice output into a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; D monitor ; enabling the management of network interfaces , rout@@ ings and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; D monitor ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings on a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; box monitor ; can be called by selecting &quot; K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; D monitor ; create areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , there will be a new module settings in the &amp; box monitor ; display network settings ( net@@ work@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network networking settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu . &quot;
it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware do not need to install . physical devices and their drivers need to be functional and configured so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all indicates and setting the network properties .
&quot; in most cases drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed at installing &amp; Linux ; installed and set up . networks are added later , the drivers need to be loaded according to the following files , according to the core version . &quot;
&quot; the module controls will be loaded if the option is selected to network settings in the &amp; box centre ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , it is trying to detect the platform used by the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform can not be recognized , the hanging choice is offered . it is the platform from the list to select which the distribution and release date is best . by setting the setting non @-@ again issues the definition can be taken permanently . when starting the network settings then this selection will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; modi@@ fying the network settings is possible only in the system management mode . previously , all options are grey , which means the settings can only be considered , the change is not possible . in the system management mode , you arrive at the right bottom of the module . it is required to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab : &quot;
the rider network interfaces is intended to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are shown . from the rider network interfaces the following tasks can be performed :
&quot; the settings can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button &apos;s button , set up in the dialog device . &quot;
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button of the button Settings shows the dialog with additional possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Autom@@ atically fet@@ ched the TCP / IP settings from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings apply to the system at the same time with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP information to each system launch , so no further settings may be required . in the selective list can be either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , you can set the TCP / IP configuration without your H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the input field , the sub@@ net is set to set . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is highlighted , the system is initi@@ alizing the network interface in the boats . if the initi@@ alization does not spare , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered into this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the box .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . input an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; console , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switch from the list and use of interface can be activated .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off , depending on the need . select a activated network unit by selecting from the list and clicking on interface .... &quot;
&quot; sets the IP @-@ address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with computers in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer exists more than a network interface , the interface has to be selected to the net in which the gateway computer is selected . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name due to the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNA triggers this name to an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the machine to nam@@ esp@@ ouse part of the equ@@ est@@ or solution enables a simple administration of this list . entries can be added , removed or modified wer@@ .@@ DNS entries can be ordered by selecting a tra@@ int or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons , or will be ordered in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group of calcul@@ ator , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then add the button Add . the entry then inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; from the group of calcul@@ ator , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the Edit dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list specifically known calcul@@ ators describes billing address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily by bo@@ oting when no DNS server available . in small , closed networks can replace it DNS server . &quot;
&quot; normally , the list contains particularly well known calcul@@ ators some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses support . still in the test version of IP should replace in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the famous billing address and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add . if the well @-@ known machine has several ali@@ ases , the button Add several times and enter the other Ali@@ as name . &quot;
select an entry of a named calcul@@ ator from the list and select Edit ... The dialog to edit your machine is displayed .
&quot; it can be done one of the following tasks , then by clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , must be placed in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
&quot; the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net , from which you can download the latest version of the source text . &quot;
&quot; for the installation of the binary distribution ( mostly r@@ pm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it &apos;s easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; console ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool can be used with graphi@@ cally surface such as the package or the installation tool of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; not , but additionally the development packages are needed with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technology is given , in the second are discussed all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; changing configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network will be conve@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never been found large distribution . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore focused on the widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of which IP address is to assign to a network interface . in foreign networks , on &amp; eg ; work@@ station is the administrator @-@ administrator who can use a valid IP address or if available , the IP address can not be selected just as desired ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , so it is possible to use any use . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machinery can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
for smaller networks are usually used addresses in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers .
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is mostly set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all computers are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special items , 0.@@ 0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.@@ 0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own machine ) . &quot;
the net@@ address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local own machine . usually the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of an own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files , which are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes change dynam@@ ically at DSL connections , so it is not surprised if in case of active DSL connections , there is no other content than set there . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ SE@@ config . another stand is expected as expected . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for belt drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar , which provided furthermore the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for quick , selective ex@@ ams . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife imagined : how much longer it takes when you secur@@ es it ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be involved by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; acc@@ ented the band back and reads the pr@@ elo@@ ad information of the belt . recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the preview of the tape is not , you will be asked if the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; DAT ; the preview , searches for the matching index on your record . can this not be found , you will be asked whether the band@@ index is to be re@@ created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol is changing for the belt drive to indicate that the band has been involved . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be searched out by the time of the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before throwing the belt , first the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to achieve this : &quot;
&quot; by changing the symbol for the tape , the integration of the band was solved and displays a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be thrown out without danger . &quot;
before a tape of &amp; k@@ dat files can be used it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ;
&quot; a band @-@ types must be form@@ at@@ ted before you use to store data . this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; this process does not correspond to the form@@ atting at &amp; k@@ dat ; it does not matter before you are form@@ at@@ ted by the belt of &amp; k@@ dat ; if you do not form@@ ulate a form@@ atting of the belt , DAT drives , on the other hand . &quot;
&quot; after entering the belt , and the capacity goes &amp; k@@ dat ; with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape will be lost automatically ! after finishing the format , the band is automatically integrated and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you encounter the backup process , you need to select the backup files . that can be done on three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only be backed by this file or folder .
highlight a backup profile in the tree . only the files shown in the profile are stored .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . just the so marked files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
click with the right mouse button on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ k ...
&quot; once the backup has been initiated , the dialog settings for securing . in this dialog you can check back the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog appears to secure the progress of the backup process , including data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives on the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
highlight the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a bun@@ ks . it will be tested only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders .
click with the right mouse button on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the test process has been started , the dialog settings for verification . in this dialog you can check back your selection and change the folder folder . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check carefully . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data collection and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can manage the restore , the files you need to be restored , this can be selected on two types : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives connected to the belt run . it will only be restored the selected file or sub@@ folder .
highlight the desired files from one of the archives with a tick . it will only be restored the so marked files and / or sub@@ folder .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu Re@@ manufacture ....
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog settings for recovery . in this dialog you can check back your selection and change the folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for recovery , the dialogue will be re @-@ establish . this dialog shows the progress of the restore process as well as the data collection and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it proves to be necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file by using the band &apos;s contents . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band :
this will create a backup profile with the currently selected files and default settings . you can make the following settings for backup profile :
&quot; the current working folder , in which the backup should be made . the list of the safest files is automatically updated according to the chosen desktop folder . &quot;
&quot; for all the folder that are listed under backup files , is that only the files are stored in the same file system , as the folder . folder that are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can enter separately under backup files . each entry is viewed by tar independent from the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ cre@@ mental backup , will have a snapshot file . it is only saved the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file which is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshots file before the call of tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of buttons are stored ; and lt ; files have not yet been completely implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the full path to the device driver for the belt drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ portable version of the belt device .
&quot; if this setting is active , transmitted &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is involved the command loading to the drive . with some drives , this is necessary before reading or write operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; to block the throw at the belt drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , it is thrown out by solving the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically the tape is ej@@ ected . use this option not at Flo@@ ppy Stream@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat . not all drives support variable blocking sizes . no matter if this attitude is active or not , you have to inform you &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your band @-@ run will communicate . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; dated ; a tape form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the belt . this file should only occupy a memory block on the tape . the content of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( by@@ te ) The band ID . the format of this string is billing : seconds , where billing is the full name of the system on which the tape is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the time when the band is form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat / .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives , which you can manage directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work , as long as it is not an incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the contents of a backup job . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; the program is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system prot@@ ector . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where to obtain information about your system , or where the system allows the various protocol files . furthermore , the system allows quick access to the example of information on issues that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; system logs ; helps users understand what makes your machine in the background . the task is suitable for in@@ experienced users , who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited the various protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; systematic users enables quick access to the example of information on issues that occur on their server . &amp; nbsp ; tries to provide some advanced functions with which the protocol files of certain programs can be fil@@ tered and evaluated . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 only has a system log ; a number of useful features . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , sets &amp; col@@ lo@@ log ; functions available , using their help the single protocol @-@ lines of a protocol file easily fil@@ tered and sort . the individual possibilities for sor@@ ting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting the system is trying to log in ; first the main protocol @-@ file of the system - the system prot@@ ok@@ oll - to open it , so you &apos;re not displayed with system administration . the protocol files can be found under Linux usually in the folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter for a selected criterion , or after inser@@ ting strings . in the default setting , the drop line contains next to the filter all . then a protocol column contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of filter search is included . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . selecting the filter search protocol will then select only with the entries in the specified column . select for example in the filter tool@@ bar the name of a process , so displays you &amp; schedule log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol rows of the level error are displayed with a show@@ y color as protocol @-@ lines of the level note . the color display of protocol lines can be switched off .
&quot; if you want to show only a certain process ( for example , in the system prot@@ ok@@ oll or in cr@@ on protocol ) , you can see the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case you use the filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the next protocol . &quot;
&quot; to use multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open and ad@@ minister . once you selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;

&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and in the following as named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for control of program arts at the high @-@ cycle of the system in the &amp; Linux ; therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -@@ In@@ it system . &quot;
I will not go here further into historical aspects ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe anyone could try to make a machine on System V In@@ it without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it , that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following further folder : &quot;
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service that you would like to launch on a different run@@ way . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ ops , which is only once started . such calls are according to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use there . you can also let a r@@ c.@@ b in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a bit on what to do with the serial connection .
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is registered in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably see that the pre @-@ placed Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it / etc / in@@ it@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful when you want to fix it by using the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you enter -@@ l enter in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that in this folder there are no right files . instead , each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
how does it start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is so written that it &apos;s an argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scrip@@ ting from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one includes a K , the script will be called stop on the argument stop . if he includes a S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server @-@ running level , which only htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; run , network &amp; etc ; , network &amp; etc ; start . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another poin@@ ter is easy to not say trivial : draw an entry from the range of Av@@ ail@@ able system services to one of the six run@@ way to start it at this level ( or stop ) .
&quot; you can move scripts also between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else . however , the entry is removed from its original runner level ( or its position ) . this only happens if they draw an entry from the range of avail@@ ble system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved , if you want to copy them into a new zone . to just copy them to a new run@@ down menu , you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of an order can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sor@@ ting numbers of the surrounding entries , before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : at present , there is no possibility to restore entries which were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tablet button to enable the different work areas ( Av@@ ail@@ able systems , Run@@ level 1 stop , Run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous ones . &quot;
to post@@ p@@ one an entry to another Run@@ level ( you can also cut it with cut into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) .
&quot; to manually change the item &apos;s number or the name of an order , press the input button to switch between different fields . enter the dialog by entering the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of loss loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) . otherwise they are stored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; restored . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts up constantly . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default run@@ way to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for exec@@ uting under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the distribution of distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way , such as system services started in these distri@@ butions simplify the configuration for proprietary combinations of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use another distribution : check if all configuration files are present , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) just end without message if its configuration files are not present or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ time so that this manual can be attached . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; to start , it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; once you have made changes , you need to save it . either you use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry into the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window is simple application . the main window consists of two mapping cards , the user and the user list . to edit the desired user or the requested group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user and group properties . &quot;
&quot; some car@@ p cards are only represented if you have advanced system settings . only if you are running space constraints ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a car@@ p card will be created where you can make individual settings . other mapping cards may be installed if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
the Car@@ tei@@ Card Pass@@ word will be released if shadow -@@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD -@@ Uni@@ xes are installed .
&quot; this mapping card appears only if for at least a built @-@ file file system ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable on the file quot@@ as user / quot@@ as group on the file system ) . here you can modify parameters for each user , using the space constraints on KB : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system , the current file system is selected with the help of the field fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the mapping card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group , to which the user belongs , you will find in the field prim@@ ate group . furthermore , the user can be member in other groups by taking them in the large field . &quot;
the dialog properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to a group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the matching addition button of the tool@@ bar . edit or delete the selected user or the selected group is an@@ alog@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the L@@ ILO boot manager , remove the pass@@ password , remove and change the time up to the boot of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , modify , change and more . &quot;
