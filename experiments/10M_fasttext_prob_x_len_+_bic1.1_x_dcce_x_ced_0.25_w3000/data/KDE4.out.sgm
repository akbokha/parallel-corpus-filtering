<seg id="386">"yes! whether you are working in the sRGB mode or do not, you need to monitor your monitor, since sRGB, so you need to work your monitor. if you are working in the sRGB of sRGB, you have to either use your monitor on the sRGB standard, you need to use your monitor profile or both."</seg>

<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the luminosity level over the entire image so that the darkest point is black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without its color variation. this feature is often a magic correction for images that are dark or washed out.</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method jusates the luminance factor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the Intensity represents the same number of pixels. sometimes, the resulting very good results in improving the object of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that leads either wonders with an image or it is destroyed."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic abbreviation: this method maximizes the color area in the red, green, and blue-channel. you will find the dark and bright borderones and jusks the red, green and blue channels on the complete histogram."</seg>
<seg id="393">Contrast: this method improves the contrast and the luminosity of the RGB values of an image through the move of the lowest and highest values on the widest possible area and a new jiustification of all values in between. this is only visible in excess pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>

<seg id="407">"this tool opens the same dialog as to the processing of blanking images. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles can be drawn to the chapter colour administration."</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tonic Surgery. this tool provides an integrated way to use multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or scanner is always the same correction. in the manual on tape correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool at the gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & checking came; tool Farming effects introduces you four color effects, a solar system effect, a neon effect and a sewer filter at your disposal."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was Solarisation, also called Sabatier, an effect of which was created by an partly developed pressure of a short lightening and afterwards the development of the picture was completed. the result was a partial negatively of the image. this tool allows you to finalize this interesting effect finely."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the solar system. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what chemically possible is possible. another increase finally creates a negativity that is not to generate on photopapier.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of solar energy efficiency. the original image is the (1) and that process the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a satiation that he makes a stronger contradiction effects which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simply, it embellishes many photos. "</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for one on daylight optimization color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the characteristics is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for his smooth picture structure. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some photo-ographs especially those little landscapes abouts too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contradiction. the parameter level controls the brightness of the outcome and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonment. at large pictures, the filter can hold the entire CPU for one moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon for you to fix the color contrasting of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your alignment can be seen in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result you are using the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you can make a photo with bad light conditions, you can get the reverse problem: one too big saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation will be a good choice for saturation rather than raising them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool Gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool for sound correction to improve exposure. even if the dialogue on this tool is very complicated, you need for the purposes described here only the area of the sliding. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>

<seg id="479">"& publications came, three different tools for the sharpness. each of you has advantages in other areas."</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpen is a traditional tool for the sharpness. it is very fast and easy, but, especially in dark areas, granate pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">Awkward mask works at the contrast of edges to make a picture of sharper. in fact it is not a little bit of psycho-visual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it's a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is copyright protected by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">Focus is possibly the best of the three because it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has several parameters to adapt.</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digital images require a correction of depth. elements that are smaller than the resolution are put together with minimal differences to a color point. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more intolerable sharpness as normal cameras for private use.</seg>
<seg id="484">"with JPEG pictures, it is often applied to a camera of internal sharpness. pictures in the raw-format must always be welded during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner apply a sharpness filter already during the reading of the image. if you disable it, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening shutters. this allows you to access the menu-yield correlation with the menu-yield."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should deal with caution though, as the results do not seem very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also amplify the noise. in general, the most suitable technology for sharpens a tool can focus. under refocus you can find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is crisp. the solution, the image a little soft to record, is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to expand with the menu item basket and experiment with you something with settings. the default window on the right of the Dialot will show you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview helps to process the image. the preview display shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the standard values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or amount will enhance the effect. if you make the sharpness mask too strong, smokers and impression of grats will generate close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius is how many pixels are affected by the filter by the filter. high-resolution images permit larger radii. they should therefore sharpen pictures best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount will be added to the percentage between the original and the wiped image one of the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the apply differential amount. it is therefore possible to define a minimum difference to a channel of filters. in this way areas, areas with a soft change between the sounds are exempt from the sharpened and therefore flaw in faces, Healing and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp mask. the original image is the (1) and the edited image (2). unsharp mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & checking came; tool refocus refocus on a picture by improving the sharpness. it used to use the copyrighted disposal filter by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to revert a picture of & quot; refocussing quot; in which it is the defocus. this is better approach than just trying the photo. refocus usually reaches better results than unsharp. you can start it from the menu by using colors refocus in image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding divides is much better than the Gauß's Faltung. the Gauß's Faltung has a very long tail, which is leading far from the source pixel, which is far influenced by the original pixel. the FIR Wiener inverse of the Gauß's Faltung is even greatly influenced by the distant pixel. caused unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. it is the most important parameter for use of this module. you can set a higher value if your image is very blurred but then take care to halchers.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: an increase in correlation can help you reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values nearby 1, & eg; 0,95 and 0.99. high value for the correlation reduces the sharpens effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filters: an increase in the noise filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1-1. however, values are higher than 0,1 only rarely useful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is 0.03. a high value is lower the image even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's edge. use these parameters if your insharpness palate is. in most cases, you should let this value be reduced to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. in most cases you should use this value to zero, so you might also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"Matrizensize: this value determines the size of the transformational size can produce good results, especially if you choose high values for the circular edge or the Gauß's edge. note that the module is very slow when you choose high values for these parameters. in most cases you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"storing as and charging buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any number of refocus parameters that you have set will be saved for later, and can then be loaded."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cuts, color and Intenances on the picture before you use the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that much operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later left unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress pictures, & eg; as JPEG, you should use the module to apply the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masking produces better results as sharpening. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighbourhood than sharpens."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, it must have seen unsharp masking always produce artifacts. even under optimal conditions it is never possible to remove the effect of insharpness. for the ViIR Viennese filter at least as well as the sharpness mask. the FIR Wiener filter is often better in the processing of small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is attributable to insufficient light for the Auto-Focus Linse.</seg>

<seg id="517">"this tool contains different preferences as a starting point, in order to simplify the restoration. the available preferences are listed below:"</seg>
<seg id="518">If you want to use the filter settings on a jusfold you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings.</seg>
<seg id="519">Detail Dewatering [0] 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to a consistent smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should be given clear that no harness should be subordinated primarily for homogeneous regions. please note that the detailing will always be subordinated to the right direction.</seg>
<seg id="520">Rivers dependency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG artefacts will create a high value wave-like pattern. JPEG artete is best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all enacted. thus, the relative smoothing factor defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value suitable to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is weenched. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">"reps: indicates, how often the algorithm is going through. usually, here is 1 or 2."</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-wide da [5, 90]: winds-dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is elected, it should also be small chosen. so note that small angles should generate a long run time. so you should choose this value as maximum possible and acceptable to suit your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral strides [0,1, 10]: integrated step-wide in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>

<seg id="535">Radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time the filters per pixel requires, and the image is spoiled by the radius of the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller faults. "</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the pivotal effect. this value sets the pixel to look forward to see luminous changes. if it is lifted up, smoking tips will be deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter picture details can no longer be received and smokes or lubricating again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge diaccuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the whole noise is removed or noise tips can occur. put it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a caller noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance of the image. we recommend you to change color or lightening to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process caused by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color intolerance of the image. we recommend you to change color or lightening to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process caused by the details -settings.</seg>

<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the phosphate absorption. this value defines as quickly the adaptive filter radius on variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges may appear too high. he can remove noise and phasenjitter at the edges. he can remove noise tips and is the recommended method for it."</seg>

<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; recurly because the second method is adaptive-recursively; recursively, because every pixel continues to be further divided and adaptive because the recurve loop depends on the calculated colors.

<seg id="1046">"when you choose the first method, POV-Ray pursues a beam of pixels. if you set the difference between hues to the neighboring pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the lowering value on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be charged with a lowering of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays depending on the pixels."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 rays depending on the pixel. if the difference between the colour values exceeds the pre-defined threshold, then the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixels and the maximum depth of the recursion can be checked with the lowering."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the generation of noise on the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, changes & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer more acceptable transparency for most people and most of the music pieces, and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme" = 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex musical pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice. "</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256" = 256 kbps CBR, compression rate approximately 5.5. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. "</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11. 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good Genug for music of young people, portable devices and autostereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information, which are manually entered or fetched by the freeDB programme, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can be passed / used with & kaudiocreator; and the codification program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with coding programs, there is often a combination of programs for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the Kodiers explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) add when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switches must be added from lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator; the result looks like '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & audiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button-drawing in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which individuals can download the audio CDs, so that all other information can be downloaded, so that all other information is spoken of: & CD; title, artist, names of pieces & etc., not by the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (Anm of the name) am not lawyer. however, nobody can prevent that you are inflicted on the & CD; however, neither the artist nor the CD; any more or less worthless, so cannot be obtained with an Bummel by a & CD; business, physical or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & audiocreator; it is actively used to select a cross-line (sending a address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address is not used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; for use of freeDB, the geographically is needed to use the next mirror server. this saves bandwidth within the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a recent list of reflections on the online revocation of & CD; information during the reading of a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (generally created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which read-program is used to store pieces from the & CD; in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used, who wants to know more exactly, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed separately if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the illuminated WAV files, the Kodiers and thus the desired file format can be chosen. in the first opening there are predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss of compression for audio data) on the tab. other Kodiers can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The code-parcel package must be installed from the respective Linux distribution prior to the codification. this is also required for the predefined coders. for more information about Kodiers are in the chapter Welcher Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1539">After installing a Kodiers you can get more information on your switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a consolention window (eg; console) must be replaced by the name of the installed Kodiers.</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the setup of the sound designation of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing - and lesbian, and whether both cdparanoia and the audio-encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, ogc & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give an indication of what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you do not want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check out the sleeve of the & CD; this will not succeed!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step for step example. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"read the complete manual, read everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas which will make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to create MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 sampling (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your machine. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution, as it is not completely free software files. anyway, it is not necessary to compile source files, which of course you can always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd consists of it and that you have screaming (eg by trying to copy something into the queror).</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setup of & audiocreator; something that probably is done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">"the second section describes the procedure for reading a & CD;, which must be repeated for each expires & CD."</seg>
<seg id="1549">"here we define the encoding codes for compression to music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). since we are lazy, we share the program with the freeDB to download the & CD; data from the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we are likely not likely to change it with any reading of a & CD; if once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device-drawing is handed over to the read-program so that it can read the & CD; -Data / pieces.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently, / dev / CDROM is a symbolic link to the real device drawing of your drive. if this is not working or if more than one & CD; / DVD drive is available, you can also take a look into the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the available entries for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1557">"the second drop field is simpler, a & CD; entry is found immediately the reading of the & CD; this is with low risk associated, if you are later dissatisfied with the database entry and the resulting file name / file name and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"aside from this example, further to note: if you want to enter everything manually, you disable the selection fields and freeDB will not use. however, this is worth using freeDB locally in offline mode, the two choices must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following mapping card."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"CDDB is available for us freeDB. these are settings for the data request, for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server through the Internet. how do the system, which data will be given the CD? read the section about freeDB. please read the section about freeDB."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is assumed that GM patches in the right order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all notes that need this instrument to put on the tone with the number M (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with clay 60), which can be similar to a gun. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so when a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (connection), it is patch 100 (the drums on your keyboard) and play the tone 60, regardless of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term drum patch the patch is meant to be a different percussioninstrument (drums, pelvis, Maracas & etc;) and not the one where the tone represents the sound height of the same drum (as some keyboards possess)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is needed to indicate how sounds are shown on a specific channel or instrument. use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as their presence. so you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only need to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to make notes on the perch-channel canal. look out as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">This section can be used to switch some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel you can easily take this in CHANNELMAP section.</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, are based on the following patterns:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n here is the channel, which is illustrated on the channel N. if you use the Keymap option, the keymap is necessary to use the name for this channel. if you use the Forcepatch option, all events will continue to change the patch on this channel. in this case, then patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for instance to always use the Persian patch on the perkconversation channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for Pitchbenderratio indicates, in which ratio Pitch-bender event will be multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch-bender event, this is only passed on with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the Map file no decimal number)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM gives a keyboard that gets a Pitch gasoline-event with the value 4096, to play a note higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards will win two sounds up to an octave higher. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, just open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find this in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the canal view is a window with a whole bunch of clvions (one for each MIDI channel). on these pivions, you see which sounds are being played."</seg>

<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so, if you find, a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece needs to be played. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc.. this can perform the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, as well as two different musicians play the same notes at very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can compel anyone, & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (an compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>

<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML-languages, which is currently not created by & quantapt.; it can be time-consuming because hundreds of day files will be necessary in the day XML format. there is the easier way to convert a DTD automatically into a DTEP package."</seg>

<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web developers for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolmaking. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related items are available only within a specific project. this can be done everything from & CSS; -patterns up to tool can be specially filed for the files of a specific project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are set out in the folder tree of the project which includes the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project.</seg>

<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, sets & collolog; functions available, using their help the single protocol-lines of a protocol file easily filtered and sort. the individual possibilities for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after starting the system is trying to log in; first the main protocol-file of the system - the system protokoll - to open it, so you're not displayed with system administration. the protocol files can be found under Linux usually in the folder / var / log, for the normal user usually no permission to read."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar, in order to filter for a selected criterion, or after inserting strings. in the default setting, the drop line contains next to the filter all. then a protocol column contains only displayed when in one of the columns the string of filter search is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can also select another entry at this point. selecting the filter search protocol will then select only with the entries in the specified column. select for example in the filter toolbar the name of a process, so displays you & schedule log; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol rows of the level error are displayed with a showy color as protocol-lines of the level note. the color display of protocol lines can be switched off.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only a certain process (for example, in the system protokoll or in cron protocol), you can see the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the samba server. in this case you use the filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can jump the option to new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new additions to the next protocol."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"to use multiple protocol files in separate subwindows. to use this feature, use the entries in the menu window to open and administer. once you selected a subwindow, select a protocol to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& A system log; has its own website on http: / / ksystematic .forum-software-software-software-software-software.</seg>
<seg id="2955">You can also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archives; kmlog; in & kde; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and in the following as named) as & ksysv; this section leads a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init rapidly develops into the standard for control of program arts at the high-cycle of the system in the & Linux; therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful and more flexible than the traditional BSD -Init system."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further into historical aspects (e.g. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe anyone could try to make a machine on System V Init without a reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init, that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysinit and the following further folder:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service that you would like to launch on a different runway. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setops, which is only once started. such calls are according to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file even if there is actually not much use there. you can also let a rc.b in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a bit on what to do with the serial connection.</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is registered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably see that the pre-placed Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix it / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful when you want to fix it by using the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you enter -l enter in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that in this folder there are no right files. instead, each entry is linked to one of the scripts in the directory init.d. "</seg>
<seg id="2968">How does it start and stop init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is so written that it's an argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripting from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one includes a K, the script will be called stop on the argument stop. if he includes a S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server-running level, which only httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc; run, network & etc;, network & etc; start."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say trivial: draw an entry from the range of Available system services to one of the six runway to start it at this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can move scripts also between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. however, the entry is removed from its original runner level (or its position). this only happens if they draw an entry from the range of availble system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved, if you want to copy them into a new zone. to just copy them to a new rundown menu, you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu and insert it into the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an order can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries, before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: at present, there is no possibility to restore entries which were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tablet button to enable the different work areas (Available systems, Runlevel 1 stop, Runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">To postpone an entry to another Runlevel (you can also cut it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V).</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change the item's number or the name of an order, press the input button to switch between different fields. enter the dialog by entering the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of loss loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc). otherwise they are stored by & ksysv; restored. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts up constantly. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default runway to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for executing under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE; or Delix (DLD), then you need to edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the distribution of distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way, such as system services started in these distributions simplify the configuration for proprietary combinations of these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use another distribution: check if all configuration files are present, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) just end without message if its configuration files are not present or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of & Linux; -Runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runtime so that this manual can be attached."</seg>
