although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is tremendous .
&quot; as many of my generation I grew up with American films , have danced to American music , American authors read and operated his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; when 14 years I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , like he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ let letter , a terrible re@@ porter with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed , who served his interest to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free according to Meth@@ od Man , &quot; I was , as if the absolute truth is , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only reinforced my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even wrote a very black@@ ish love of its size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot was written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as it deals with his bot@@ t@@ apping .
he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague express it , and declare publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people have re@@ acted to his statements and voted for him in Sh@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes received by the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number one ever reached by the Party &apos;s nom@@ inee candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ otte person why I asked myself ?
I could not reconcile Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journalist program , which people from around the world took up a deep @-@ hearted man with whom I talked about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ umps of world@@ view not agreed by Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our joint love for basketball , and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps In@@ intolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , who fights their lives long the environment , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me as their son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the commitment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot at my career . &quot;
these people and those through them embo@@ died values deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; during Tr@@ ump his way to the nom@@ inee of Republi@@ can Presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps especially because of his cont@@ emp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to overlook these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is unfair to describe the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as a rac@@ ist .
&quot; to arrange the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
&quot; this is superficial and respectful , and indicates a in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think . &quot;
it shows the people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most white are tuned for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick who comment@@ ated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with cont@@ emp@@ t for those who look differently from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( An@@ m. ) . : as much as &quot; Rec@@ eption of the White to all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; ; wording of white in terms of white and whi@@ plas@@ h , as it was the great Van Jones , has just killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have , America is called every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land , as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers , whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin , they say . &quot;
&quot; for all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word @-@ change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would have my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , a place in your America ? &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a loud &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; brood the amount . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; I answered them . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they called them and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a lonely and vo@@ icing &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan closed with the words : &quot; God be thanks , Mr. Tr@@ ump , that is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now m@@ umps , &quot; &quot; said the message . &quot;
and all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find place in this new America .
and that breaks my heart .

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean city C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a huge garbage dump , just 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( Musik@@ Ban@@ de ) has now played a sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra in the municipality : a way to overcome them with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hop@@ eless@@ ness .
the young band@@ members are taking their obligations to the music group very seriously and means the local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI .
&quot; once they come out of school , they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to follow their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they come close and play with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , flute , pen@@ thouse , pen@@ ises and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from the trash
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village which is practically located above at the biggest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments that are made from reg@@ aining waste material : &quot;
&quot; playing with re@@ prepared instruments , made from local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura where the recycling under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Chávez have started to transform parts of the fall into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate G@@ own , viol@@ as , viol@@ as , bass , bass , fl@@ utes , sa@@ x@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion who were all produced from the rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of The Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times F@@ avi@@ o Chávez , a local econom@@ ist and musician instructor of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no space for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash . children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o somewhat what he had never seen before : one out of waste @-@ made violin .
today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments coming from again prepared material and that is called The Recycling Orchestra .
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmony &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world creates about one billion tons of garbage . &quot;
those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of C@@ ate@@ ura . Paraguay .
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis .
these East African countries show how technology and team work can be successful by illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was then known that this ship had already operated il@@ bla@@ sts by illegal fishing , before it was the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a legislative bre@@ cher of this species at its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to give him one of their har@@ bours and refused to give him a fishing village . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries which you simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisheries authority . it is part of a team that discovered the ship again and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : he did not succeed to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , because of pl@@ undering of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which protects criminal practices and protects resources , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fishing stop ) . &quot;
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that at that time had driven the Premier of their waters .
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where it is illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project provides F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , present because it is extremely difficult to trace . so , the illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing from regions . &quot;
&quot; through the inten@@ tional cont@@ emp@@ t of existing laws , by which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that a delicate equilibrium . &quot;
&quot; however , while actions against illegal fisheries were once affected by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the snow@@ fl@@ us@@ o , with the information between individual countries , the actions today occur in real time , with trac@@ eable on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists of existing licenses , updates to suspi@@ cious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to identify the authorities , ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such as susp@@ ects discover - about those who indicate that a ship invites its full fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fish license where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal spirits . &quot;
&quot; countries which are against illegal fishing , may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports , which means that ships can not sell their charge . and that they can even be forced to numbers of punishment as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s then about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is financially supported . &quot;
&quot; and this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leading Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the previously mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales , which increase the eight members of the network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i each year because of illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fish , present to the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also seven illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; their practices include such activities such as the sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit licence papers , indicating fanta@@ sies , the fish @-@ protected species and the fish in reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non @-@ incomplete control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier there was a ship illeg@@ ally fishing and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ed not to run my harbour . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and exactly this leg@@ ale hat@@ ch tries to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i now .
so far the closed front does not work .
F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i participated in more than 30 examinations of susp@@ ects .
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , the fake licenses used in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identities and it has been pro@@ secuted and found fle@@ eting ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crimes , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i may share information on illegal fishing over large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system that is to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i , susp@@ ects ships more precise . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always further developed , will also help to split the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems , giving them no longer of satellites . &quot;
&quot; cop@@ eland helps therefore to build a system that connects various information levels with each other . it should help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find crimin@@ ally agile ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global F@@ ishing Watch , together with Google and the Sea Organization of Oc@@ e@@ ana : a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown by means of the position of every single trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this is simply meaning &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities can not only feel criminals but they too .
&quot; ships used earlier without a license and had little to reck@@ on with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i countries meanwhile have a 33 % increase in fishing sales , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped , Gre@@ ko 1 opened up doors , the inspec@@ tors found there on board hau@@ ling networks , whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with kind permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing every year . &quot;
&quot; there are six countries collap@@ sed , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting for illegal fishing , according to the same model such as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; With security , the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions &quot; , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could report from Somalia : in October it was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under false flag . and not only was the ship used without a license , and were used by hau@@ ling networks , which are now prohibited . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put a strong sign that they will proceed against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collaborative effort to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea . Emma Br@@ yce is freel@@ ance journalist and lives in London . she writes on the subject of environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and in the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is moving forward to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of capture the country &quot;
the street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
they are considered to protest against the decision of the government to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela has rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , re@@ acted the Venezu@@ el@@ ans , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country ran into emp@@ t@@ iness by opening up the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( e.g. : the return of Venezuela ) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the low@@ land area Bar@@ inas , in the Andes @-@ regions Mé@@ rida and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , centrally located north @-@ north of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita at the federal state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country is continually worsen@@ ing what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication .
&quot; &quot; &quot; many representatives of the opposition have blocked the chance of fundamental change in the ministers of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro . ultimately , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , concludes with the context of the Government &apos;s article in its latest article : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and violence belong to the highest around the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was the only way to restore its institutional structures and to close a new governance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral bloc of Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Democr@@ á@@ tica or briefly MU@@ D ( e.g. : round table of the Democratic unit ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups were assembled , calling on October 27th , a mass rally to support the National Assembly , on November 3 , should continue to persist the blocking of the referendum to the ministers . &quot;
the call has been commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike , and on 3 November all following Car@@ acas to Miraflores palace . &quot;
continued ! pic@@ .t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ N@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action program &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , 26 October . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches , which are published in real time , testify among other things an overwhelming involvement of the people in numerous areas of the country , but also disputes with poli@@ c@@ emen and advoc@@ acy of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most shared images shows a prot@@ esters that calls through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot;
&quot; will you kill me , because I have hunger ? &quot; , &quot; scar@@ es of these Vene@@ tians . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter accum@@ ulate images that tell of disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; especially great waves , the news about poli@@ ci@@ al repression in the central @-@ north city of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the demonstrators moved back to the local Cathedral to protect itself according to their own statement before the police and the armed advoc@@ acy of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went on . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstrators tried to escal@@ ate the police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear rub@@ bing , because otherwise you could see something that many nation@@ alists do not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an Info@@ graphic is already making a lap which forms the amount of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a ministers process - this has now been proven in the eyes of many innumerable people on the street .
My@@ te@@ ke Media Labs in addition :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o claim that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your counterpart !
on the road !
&quot; others , consider these protests as a further step in the fight against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and would rather be busy , critical voices . &quot;
they have taken us so much - but also fear !
the mar@@ ches always take more in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some vene@@ ers reported the media , they are too hungry to participate in a strike , instead of working or to buy shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview of Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was instruc@@ ted on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ inian news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father , the atrocities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; now , in the context of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , Qui@@ j@@ ano said in the province of Córdoba to his father . &quot;
&quot; in the process , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not chosen his life .
&quot; starting with the Bür@@ de , to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military audi@@ tors in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed in the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years he held the family of life for himself .
in the situation then I believed that was all right .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , Fol@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was gendar@@ mer@@ ciful . during the Argent@@ in@@ ean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state hero@@ ism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Assistant commander of the intelligence department 141 in the prison of La Per@@ la . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano .
archiving .
&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pressor , which is charged for ab@@ duction in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atrocities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a national court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent over his child , and as this child chose a path of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I had made friends with a boy who made batt@@ ling . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend on it .
he said :
&quot; you are an Ar@@ sh@@ ole , you are delighted with one of the ERP . &quot;
pass solely on that they do not lead you one day and I have to save you .

that &apos;s why he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me with his work on the military base .
&quot; he said to me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine . for so my father had moved me . &quot;
at the military base I had to destroy Pap@@ ers who had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ dr@@ on are the prisoners tor@@ tured
my father took me a total of four times after La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
at first and last time he allowed me to wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to leave . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , television , refriger@@ ators - just everything possible . &quot;
all of it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small in a blan@@ ket wrapped bag , and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a large l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
this day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items have been parked and signed me with a guard .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
there the prisoners are tor@@ tured .
I saw in and saw a couch that were tor@@ tured on men .
she looked like a field bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they fortified the one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they rarely saw a man with a hand@@ shake to the bed , covered it with water and said to him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the st@@ ank there was in inside ... like a fil@@ thy winds .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were sh@@ ac@@ kled with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and to bind them . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian one who was also charged in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a series of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
close to the entrance of the entrance stood still on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father spot@@ ted that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ est thou so , Ar@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
I escaped &quot; Why have you otherwise brought me up ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my father spoke at home .
&quot; besides La cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms , which were called offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero made a man up there and killed .
&quot; ( according to the survivors of the civil ist Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indicted in La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , through the former folklore chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , on which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the map , see that they took about this route and then tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names have changed and they received a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement from above came , that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the euph@@ em@@ ism - for the deportation of men and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; War Cri@@ mes &apos;
my father brought all kinds of stolen things with home .
back then at the age I had no idea what the &apos; war &apos; was - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later on the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - became clear to me that war ute was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs which one is opposed to an enemy which is fought . &quot;

&quot; but if one goes into a house and the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war of war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
&quot; I was also officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I never liked to penetrate into a house and ste@@ al everything in it . &quot;
I don &apos;t understand how my Father could do this .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , and thou art thou cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded before anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and bring you stub@@ born . &quot;
for this we need no one else !
this was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I told the process , I showed a photo of that time on which I bore a jacket and a sco@@ pul@@ pul@@ lover of wool . both I had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; then he accused me to defend the defense , a co @-@ conspir@@ e with this crime . I am temp@@ ted , no problem , they can put me to the burden of what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the sp@@ ying of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I find re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; it develops and recognises , that it is wrong to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ iled to people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children run ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with his mother , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
I asked me again the question : they were tor@@ tured but why were they killed ?
they would have just been able to put them into prison .
&quot; I guess it was simply decided to kill this people , but what their cor@@ p@@ ses leave ? &quot;
were these people not also families who could pass their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the dis@@ mis@@ understanding of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when the democracy was re @-@ introduced , hol@@ ked machines to eliminate the mortal remn@@ ants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and found somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something of course remains forever .
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought , indicate my father , was created during a conversation when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atrocities that I had to experience .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ wardly dead and asked me , why the whole over@@ plain patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; which they supposedly defended themselves . &quot;
then I scre@@ am :
how can you tell me something about me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed horrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he only ref@@ utes &quot; &quot; Well @-@ then &quot; . &quot; &quot;
that is exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I re@@ funded the first ad . &quot;
I was finally recognized that he was a criminal .
no one can blame me that I am ab@@ used . I finally told my own father .

the judg@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the Spanish order of the ruling .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera passed away because of the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims in August 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 op@@ pres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity ; the Court held in 28 cases of life @-@ long arrest , and in nine cases of arrest , between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were free trial . &quot;
eleven of the original accused died during the trial .

&quot; a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; terrible driving &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation errors in a center in Kyoto , in which one can extend his driving licence . &quot;
the photo was circul@@ ated in social media .
editing of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened center in which one can prolong its driving licence , last month witnesses a very special translation . &quot;
&quot; on a shield , the Japanese word does not mean the &quot; older drivers &quot; that means &quot; older drivers , &quot; mistak@@ enly - maybe but also with arches &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; fri@@ ghtful motor@@ ists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the false translation was from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
dealing with the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that have often been divided into the social media .
&quot; the mistake was revealed to the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a inhabit@@ ant of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local time of the local time . &quot;
the daily newspaper Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city such as Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; drivers &quot; &quot; ) was later replaced by the en@@ ere , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct designation &quot; El@@ der &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police in Kyoto pre@@ apologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , it was stated that the error was already included in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not tested on its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported like this about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincere sorry that older people felt by the insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News set something more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan apart and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was denoun@@ ced as in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are not involved in accidents , but definitely cause for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the pre@@ fecture of Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , Sen@@ iors 1.@@ 8@@ 03 caused by a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; thus , her share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has declined in total , the proportion of seniors caused by seniors in the same period has increased . &quot;
&quot; the specifically called re@@ porter brought comments to light in the published version of the article Comments to the light showing , which prejudices some Japanese apparently he@@ eded against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo , about the translation errors , received the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; fear@@ less driver &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; Just error is the translation actually not , or ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t find that this is a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so common in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real bon@@ anza for these bizarre mistakes in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to over@@ head , one needs two important skills : passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case with native language . in general , the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be . &quot;
&quot; thus , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue , the translations into English . this may be mis@@ led by understanding of the over@@ putting , cost @-@ grounds or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese learning . &quot;
&quot; some companies that even have no foreign employees , translations can still produce fir@@ ing internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are perceived as the best ones , for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ated and pu@@ zz@@ ling phrases that are created by machine translation , show that this technology can not replace a human translator for a long time . this applies to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are used only for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be as jewelry yet acceptable or at least harmless . but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
the city of Kyoto is hopefully using a serial source for its translations in the future .
Venezuela : to take protests and cens@@ ored actions on the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7th of April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users who won &apos;t have access to the online radio station Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presence of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV also wrote no more accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ itter , the protests of the protests in Car@@ acas were organised by op@@ position@@ ists , who res@@ isting the government Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests started in early April , after the Supreme Court was dissolved the Parliament and transferred the responsibilities of parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is folded , and recommended the users , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activated your VPN .
it seems that web pages of the Venezu@@ elan provider are once again locked .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of unrest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been hesit@@ ant in the reporting of protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission was calling for tele@@ com@@ s and def@@ enses when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
surprisingly that it is still cheaper than two lit@@ res le@@ mon@@ ade to buy .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by a block of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online channels . this also applies to the website , on which the National Assembly transm@@ its its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier retrosp@@ ect of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had to use that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS @-@ server answer specific domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server respon@@ ds or denied the request during the call of such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; in V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , the transmission on Thursday , 6th of April , was hired , as the V@@ PI@@ TV camera , Elvis Flor@@ es who took live the protests in Car@@ acas live in custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police officers .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multi @-@ media coverage about current events in the country . &quot;
Paraguay will become a lot of girls to get an apprenticeship
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . now , she visits the house where she worked for years . &quot;
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimonies of other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just like the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo of Cecilia Ro@@ jas . use with friendly permission of Kur@@ ier .
the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and published by Global Vo@@ ices of Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household , where they didn &apos;t work together with the family who was living there . &quot;
shortly before their university degree at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house spoke full of pride about it . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; the one turned out of something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she started working as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ lla , in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money over@@ comes their under@@ age son or her inferi@@ or daughter to another , richer family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned in this case is that the children should do so countless days of house@@ work that will never be paid and be victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a treaty that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this is known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , Paraguay is widely used in Paraguay , due to the participation and acceptance of large parts of society and in spite of numerous complaints from human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization which is fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ lla - especially young girls are affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - accum@@ ulate testimonies , investigated and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things on behalf of name , because the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated the Cri@@ adi@@ c , is guaranteed to be silent in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who wish their daughter in believing that they can complete their education , improve their position in society , and can make something out of itself , to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes the girl with themselves and justi@@ fies their exploitation with the belief that they would give someone a chance that would otherwise be no education and maybe even star@@ ed . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mis@@ used , his family will experience only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they even experience them .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previous relatively unknown phenomenon has been held in the secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; as Carolina Mar@@ ín in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú came to hospital , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former military district Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer at the District Court .
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 km east of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in the end of January 2016 Fer@@ re@@ ira , as long as with a stick in Mar@@ ín , until they suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of young girls .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they emphas@@ ised that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go deep in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ment of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest leaders and demanded that there will be no other Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows as children registered , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to hurt the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a rapid investigation into the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a case of Carolina , if for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; criminals are exploited not only as workers , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ mers , where her father worked , she had to register and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; her brothers now had to work all , and began to sell on the street or on the market sweets to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employers Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
she had to share the time so that you still have time to learn .
she stood up against five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; for example , puri@@ fied the fridge , pl@@ ast@@ ed the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more they had done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; however , this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she had to go hungry , but got also not in@@ definitely food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the landlord as eating out of the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ isers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings of households Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him and to read editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings like &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to not believe the reports of the official media on the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he did she for intelligent , but he did not speak with her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke to him , while he spoke about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t allow me to visit my family because they were of the opinion that I would go there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; so they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ í , at home again their mother tongue Guaran@@ i would speak . &quot;
&quot; her master feared that she had the education , which she had allowed her to lose again , she explains . &quot;
&quot; it was quite clear , however , that they had paid for everything they had received from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; also in the school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a is discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never was spoken , Mob@@ bing and the Shi@@ ph@@ s are exposed if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children parents have , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I could not invite anyone to my home . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , at the time where friend@@ ships develop , I feel particularly clear that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;

&quot; another woman who also came from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s inner that would like to work . &quot; &quot; &quot;
then the op@@ ener in the ad changed once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I see if it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;

draft law prescri@@ bes Egyptian users social media to register with the government

&quot; sixty Egyptian votes have recently agreed to &quot; &quot; the regulations governing the use of use and usage of social networks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by the Parliament , beneficiaries and users of social media must register in Egypt with a government agency to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , then there would be a position that is asked to give citizens a permit to give social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , beneficiaries and users have to register on the site with their correct names and personnel numbers to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it failed to do this , so that could be a penalty of up to six months in prison or a money . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six Par@@ ag@@ ra@@ fen and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs over the Internet and used to communicate with others through voice , vide@@ on@@ ach@@ ers and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when the draft is assumed , since the draft is no indication of how Egyptian authorities want to record the user . it is not clear that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l S@@ du@@ l S@@ du@@ l S@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , Parliament of Parliament and promot@@ ers of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user name , and users received a username and a password to come through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt is planning to judge a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . due to those , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts on site are skep@@ tical about the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research @-@ related research &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , &quot; said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt greatly on the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as it could be done by violent physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then this means that they will establish a strong surveillance system to request citizens who request permission or not . and this means a mad system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring it into a judicial process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legis@@ lature of the Parliament and the Constitutional committees before it goes into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military mind@@ set in parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and is ensured that no ab@@ err@@ ation of scar on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy struck a law against cy@@ ber crime against cy@@ ber crime , in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those intended to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and to protest . &quot;

high up in the mountains of Kurdistan in the north @-@ east of Iraq the animal conserv@@ ation@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and her team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , that strikes between Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and fra@@ gment of their habitat and since they are always less loot @-@ prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; like R@@ aza in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining rob@@ ber in the Kurdish ecosystem &apos; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on that a big predat@@ ory is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video is therefore fixed , that they have a shot of a great cat in the camera , breaks R@@ aza in pure joy . &quot;
as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ ine R@@ aza passionate about a different side of their country that does not just consist of war and conflict .
it has been involved in field studies on wild animals and studies of Nature Iraq for six years .
it has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring that protected zones for wild animals in the region of Kurdistan have been established .

&quot; early March 2017 documented that was achieved for the North @-@ East Japan daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made during the last six years in order to re@@ construct the life of those who had been hit by the &quot; Tri@@ ple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a tremendous earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic @-@ accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered the disaster . &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , was one of the pre@@ fec@@ tures in Japan Nor@@ theast , which both had to experience the earthquake and resulting in ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring par@@ c@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate have been forced up , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had whole coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; even so , Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture has had a nuclear accident , already alone - 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows the progress made six years later in order to re @-@ establish the lives of the local population .
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as pol@@ l results of those affected by themselves .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ newspaper reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( on the contrary , have been applied to the pre@@ fec@@ tures of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could be recorded Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima with 70 percent will be the final light . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , one always tries to locate six years after the catastrophe , ev@@ acu@@ ated by Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ shel@@ ters ( on the contrary , the usual , cas@@ et@@ su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) to be settled in final spare parts . &quot;
after the triple catastrophe nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in housing shel@@ ters .
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such car@@ esses . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evac@@ uation from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remained more successful in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas mi@@ ast@@ ag@@ i was more than 75 per cent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated shel@@ ters , which were transformed into final houses . &quot;
the number here is about 34 per cent .
the state of works and daily life in the three concerned pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; how the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 from 1100 schools , which were affected by evil , their p@@ for@@ ten by December 2016 , which makes up almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures is much more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of the fisheries in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , have resum@@ ed only 30 percent of the fishing ships in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; ts@@ un@@ ami and the atomic accident , have drawn large @-@ scale in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agriculture . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of destructive agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a result of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of arable lands from Fu@@ kus@@ hima are located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear waste zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered and recovered , but here Fu@@ kus@@ hima remains far off . &quot;
the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent on the same level as before the un@@ happiness . Fu@@ kus@@ hima can be achieved here only 75 percent .
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the catastrophe nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it feels more difficult to feel their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next major earthquake ?
&quot; to determine a total picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys under the native population and under the evac@@ uation by . she asked her about the state of re@@ building and also how their rebellion has changed to the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in their introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey through to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness under the native population .
&quot; the survey brought that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken to be prepared to be prepared for the future earthquake and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , there are 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents , that still did not have enough to be done in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; as it comes to those , which had been ev@@ acu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture . &quot;
in her expenditure on the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also strengthened its attention to the position of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima had to experience not only the enormous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness to the worst , disastrous , nuclear accident , the Japan ever . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 Ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were moved outside the pre@@ fecture of the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2016 a little more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , were transformed into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the date of 2017 , there are still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es , most of the ev@@ acu@@ ated cities are over 50 years old . they do not have to compete for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima with massive construction projects . this is a building projects , which are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; if one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our in@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in the reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly linked to someone over language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i speaks about the similarities between Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ aci@@ as explained how the love of music worked with people from all over the world ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when she worked with people from around the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week into the intensive care centre : last Friday had taken him a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with a stroke on the head . nationwide took millions of prot@@ esters in a protest march against austerity .
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , the social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several fac@@ tions . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and now took him into a artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local sculptor Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread rapidly in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures also the face of the police officers can be seen with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the investigation of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers , as he suggests in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia with his stroke on the face of the students Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) . &quot;
&quot; if a police officers would knock out a prot@@ esters and land on the intensive care station , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , divided by Lu@@ iz da Luz , where you can see how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edic shortly afterwards to him . &quot;
another video with the same scenes but from another perspective is also filmed in social networks .
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state of state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ an Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to cover a part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás experienced a wave of political force : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ m@@ me was murdered by his father , because he has been murdered the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have been attacked the very sad case by Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who has been attacked by a poli@@ c@@ emen , who has been attacked by a police officer who has beaten him with a stroke . &quot;
police attacks
Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil where there was a brutal police force against prot@@ esters last Friday .
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen were at the protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where prot@@ esters had built a stage for speakers , rubber @-@ stories and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police via speaker to ren@@ oun@@ ce violence against demonstrators . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media street prot@@ ru@@ gated by focusing on another , unexpected protagonist : a window of windows . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported on a cervi@@ cal glass window to shape their front page illustr@@ ative with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o fav@@ ored a title story with a one in fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken shut@@ ters than the protests of thousands of thousands who serve the defense of a special thing . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary to recognize , if you are strictly against any form of atomic damage . &quot;
&quot; here also here the term &quot; &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; &quot; receives an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical violence of military police are dec@@ eived by headlines with the title &quot; demonstrators in confron@@ ting the Police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
those of the de@@ indu@@ str@@ alization of forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the Act of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar factories included in Cuba the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of its that there is no worthwhile sugar @-@ harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were l@@ ame in the sugar factories .
&quot; after completion , the sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its installations , until only the rum@@ ors of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 2@@ 72 workers had to find new things anew .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ fied and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which still ad@@ mon@@ ition . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , which stands every day at 4 : 00 am in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry is rob@@ bed not his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are su@@ gars in the east of the region sugar factories , which are in operation after lengthy in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remembers exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich were received the sugar factory , but the promise has not been kept . &quot;
&quot; the su@@ gars industry already resist the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , the in@@ efficiency , the poor administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production of 1,6 million tonnes was sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; for a few decades , the news would have been a motive for alarm for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests have not been any new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway station of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar industry was an economical necessity : the 155 sugar factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they became in@@ portable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to focus production on the most efficient factories , the annual production goal amoun@@ ted to 4 million tons . &quot;
they only allowed the factories to produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of the sugar plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the su@@ gars rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 the price of an un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os , according to the OECD , published by the OECD and FAO , the agricultural and Food organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would achieve the level of 2001 ( 3,@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the pipe exports would manage about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go into history with certainty , which were the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro in his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years the lac@@ tation of a total of 98 sugar factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the su@@ gars of the Greg@@ orio Arl@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez worked since 1967 in the factory .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word he most repeated , &quot; scam . &quot; &quot;
nearly all respondents are of same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory was shut down .
&quot; in order that the place will receive , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first closing year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would only be distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , the addres@@ see and date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could approve any acceptance . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was sur@@ passed and the letters were becoming more frequent . &quot;
Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the st@@ alled factory two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will in the lac@@ tation of the factory , at whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part that he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important job producers was er@@ ased out .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services which generated the systems in the municipalities where they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President looked into the eyes of the present people , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane brands
since 2004 the sugar cane is extracted only high by the parliamentary elections .

&quot; after two years the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar factory closed , or better said , when they began to dis@@ credit them , they also listened to the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting , this also disadvantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search for other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without a prospective perspective , many young people have left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for supplying the community . &quot;

first Nations Young people use Hi@@ p Hop to express themselves and get their own culture
&quot; recording of a song from &quot; &quot; Home to Me &quot; &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation . &quot;

&quot; young people of the First Nations communities in Canada are dealing with issues that are important for them . they do so by Hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a number of migrant workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of the N &apos; we Jin@@ an Tour , the workshop team has been bringing mobile studios directly to schools and youth centers in order to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were guided by educ@@ ators David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then worked together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop is thus increasing that young participants in discussions related topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , conflict , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever happens to them . &quot;
&quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which young people are the main actors . &quot;
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago at the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the School &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ yo@@ o in the area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia shows for example the story of Highway 16 , also &quot; Highway the tears , &quot; at which almost two dozen young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely unknown .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the young people don &apos;t always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from North@@ stars Hi@@ p @-@ Hop @-@ group who had a St@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e .
&quot; at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ site of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is at your disposal , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel as if none have ever been interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
that is the day when you receive our cry
because we lost our way to life as a youth
but I believe that we will be raising one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and move on our youth as well .
how can they do what it is determined to be the creator .
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ he in Sil@@ en@@ cap@@ tion ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan they can be seen in front of almost any restaurant plastic courts .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , are exhibited near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ ze san@@ pur@@ u ( including the usual , the usual , &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; ) of every food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
the customers look at these plastic meals and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic treatments .
&quot; in the to@@ ki@@ cking part of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a variety of these small businesses that manufacture the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a in front of more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese these plastic meals are usually so common that they don &apos;t even find them up to them . however , a new trend transforms them today into show@@ y cell accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of Social Media Links and Photos , which show this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ ze san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in the special sale : new with plastic @-@ produced mobile @-@ belts , as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods were converted to kit@@ ten collection objects , as in this case , cooling cabinet magnets : &quot;
here are a few Sho@@ oting refriger@@ ation cabinet for a new exhibition in Tokyo @-@ Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly expensive .
in this case a cave @-@ don ( a popular travel line with seafood ) was transformed into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone .
also this part we have made for the exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple that cap@@ es your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to see as an apple , with a candle for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing strain .
&quot; some Handy @-@ St@@ ones and mobile @-@ designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen used , a popular lake , which is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; is there someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now can I let my mobile with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot;
I believe I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic food can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , in order to surprise colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest mobile @-@ pole has the shape of mel@@ tdown .
&quot; in addition , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and hand@@ y@@ tapes of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals you can view at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter to the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to find out more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you insight into the district of K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi , who is dedicated to the recovery of the restaurant industry . for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ ze san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually produced .
a mex@@ ican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports foreign and foreign media above the in@@ famous &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the mis@@ hes and Get@@ ting periodic@@ ally appear to appear regularly in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy which this struggle with itself . &quot;
&quot; reporting about drug bos@@ ses like El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ els , pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , there is hardly any one looking at the grapes or the con@@ gregations that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind each bone of bone , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , their wounds might never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the mex@@ ican intelligence portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with the drug store &quot; &quot; ) to give this sacrifice a voice , and stories of people working in the struggle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico describes the project so :
organized crime cannot only be afraid of our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , if business close , because they are threatened by drug retailers and all municipalities therefore need to ride many kilometers to buy something such as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ es@@ p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; as fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , who is looking for every weekend secret tombs after his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ guez , who in just one day lost their father , their four brothers , her husband and two of their ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task that we have placed ourselves , go and to graves after the people we loved to look . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
&quot; he was 28 , when he disappeared . &quot;
he has three children .
he worked in a power shop in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13 he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should return again , but he never came again . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
there is also my mother who is also here with me .
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you have the assurance of my father , but they do not receive them out because of a mort@@ als . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we don &apos;t just need to show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high risk cancer .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a les@@ bian of Animal Pol@@ í@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the title pages with pictures that actually can only come from a textbook for criminals or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only ones that disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts as a lack of respect towards the person who once belonged to that body . &quot;
I cannot be equal or consider this as normal .
you write on :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin wants that he will be Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if he is great . and it is also not normal that people listen to the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me it is , as if they dec@@ ayed those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened so something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if telling stories about blo@@ ating numbers in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of men is incredible for me when the death of six people and the ti@@ ghtening of 43 students were justified in a neighboring village that they were &quot; s@@ äs@@ sig . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk , that they remain spar@@ ed by such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months &quot; black@@ mail in the main urban district : how a family with threats had been de@@ pl@@ ated by threats , as they press the armed crime month for month money from their business until they ended up not only the shop , but also had their family apart . &quot;
you think about everything you have lost and how some people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain upward never goes , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed their phone numbers too .
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are away from each other , the better . &quot;
it included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , as one does not know when they are led or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if wines would solve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I have forgotten how to cri@@ es . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the contribution &quot; The forgotten Children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : one of violence referred to .
he raises questions like : who takes care of the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies which live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; however , they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for the whole life of violence , and to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but that was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been past two years ago , when he saw only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like that : &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , Ju@@ á@@ rez , Ju@@ á@@ rez , the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murder , public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the pro@@ secutor &apos;s secutor had been 3@@ 103 mur@@ ders . this corresponds to 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just some hundreds of thousands of thousands who leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate into the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live with new headlines , but this project reminds us of those we must not forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; has launched its target @-@ job project of Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the past four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this article and the pages to which he linked , include pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about up@@ lift or fal@@ si@@ fy a fake .
&quot; but how is the years after doing something the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to persist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication it was mis@@ leading , trage@@ dies , which actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; wrong context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of me@@ tic@@ ulous reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our longing for pictures on news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol @-@ carriage crossed the place of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked around and explo@@ ded . thereby , 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war in Africa the second largest country had been neglected and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region had become dangerous paths full of perc@@ ussions , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the petrol station fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; official representative described a fire@@ ball , the Danish houses interven@@ ed including a movie theaters , which was full of people who watch the football world championship . &quot;
houses were scattered and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses in the streets scattered .
many people were burned aside .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; by Im@@ g@@ ur users My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Multi@@ er photos of the board are the gru@@ es@@ ome scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for this .
it shows rows el@@ ded body that are mounted on the floor during persons they look at .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been applied several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not in the context of the trage@@ dies , particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what and what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atrocities that they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and cor@@ pse pl@@ agues in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed , but no one stayed back to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen on Human Rights Watch . &quot;
many were disper@@ sed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be exemplary . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army base in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am , country to gain ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture taken out of the DR Congo again when it was mis@@ understood as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented :
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failures ; Africa check has documented immigration to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the picture was presented as a test@@ ament to mass@@ ages .
yet another step further bring personal comments like this example of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to arguments .
the image from San@@ ge entered also in combination with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash message , published by the United Nations the ones that could flee , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported by violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , &quot; &quot; Po@@ sts like the following that these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo have gathered : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 was argu@@ ing , the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ ein being said , monks and politicians would have involved in the assassination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to watch this information . &quot;
&quot; the original fee , which was finally accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that AF@@ P came as their source as well , had also written Th@@ ein being this statement , but did not have the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false cl@@ ots date back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using a &quot; reverse picture search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; a revers@@ ed picture search with the search engine ink Tin@@ Eye has found at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixing of private sites , platforms in social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek , and Portuguese . &quot;
some have passed incorrect reports , isolated others have tried to dis@@ solve counterf@@ eit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; we have limited examples of the use of ab@@ used use and associated with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . by this way , we want to be more visible than the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were linked in some cases ) several examples of mis@@ used use .
here some cases that can now be completely sc@@ aled ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fr@@ ames .
country examples from the wrong head of the picture from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange @-@ colored countries indicate sides or server , on the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or counterf@@ eit messages still are available . &quot;
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples which are available according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ der , probably also for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; remembering , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the picture from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeri@@ an and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot;

&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only report the false statement , but also discussed the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria and further questions about the intentions of the people and the involved trage@@ dies ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los Cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article about explo@@ sions in North @-@ Canada in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ blica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
&quot; La Rep@@ ú@@ blica cited as his source of Spanish news agency E@@ fe ( not known ) , whether the original report has the image included ) . &quot;
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; T@@ wit@@ ter@@ contributions according to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , like this one , who used the picture from the DR Congo to illustrate the &quot; atrocities of Islam &quot; , have clearly seen no pages like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster to refu@@ te this . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a Association of students of theology ( Mul@@ l@@ ahs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the N@@ asi@@ m Agency and illustr@@ ating the picture of the DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;

&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria this photo was divided by the DR Congo as a test@@ ament to the bombing of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano , in public discussion . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of a mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo , with a twe@@ et , sympathy against the Nig@@ erian Mass@@ akers , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger , the asser@@ tions that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are pro@@ secuted , since the photos of it were mis@@ used . &quot;
Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , the Myanmar government released a ri@@ ghtful place to create what it was considered as &quot; inten@@ tionally fin@@ alised messages and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings with regard to Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this ri@@ ots , which is exclusively published in English , also includes references to counterf@@ eit images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to kill Buddh@@ ists and around ( which is often circul@@ ated by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; this post , which directed itself to the members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is not allowed to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page asser@@ ted that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein dw@@ ells in 2012 have been given that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image of San@@ ge .
the article was updated in 2014 and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 &quot;
&quot; this article by 2014 about students who were killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the recent news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture was not written by the kill@@ ings but it claims that there is a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later linked to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to resist that there was connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ u@@ y@@ a@@ Ma@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria burning , the world is sleeping ) . &quot;
&quot; the picture of the DR Congo emerged , provided with this twe@@ et @-@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and del@@ etes a discussion among Muslims after the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the proposal on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ in@@ ably in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was danced as a test@@ ament to the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 Male ret@@ we@@ et ) . but the messages that were associated with it were taken in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting in the comparison of Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) in 2014 .
&quot; after a message that was supposed to have been written by a &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , we put forward discussions as this here in Vietnamese and explained it to fal@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; from the message , in which the image of the DR Congo was included , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of an incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sides in the following countries ( on the cap in grey ) , ink also indicates , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Ethiopia , Peru , Ethiopia , Japan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ w@@ lers and isolated they have image input in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all of these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the image ultimately carries a correct description , but the original fee is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two powerful topics or frames ( fr@@ aming ) that draw these po@@ sts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to major discussions on the silence in connection with the m@@ ord@@ ances of Christians through Muslims or - to defend Muslims - the m@@ ord@@ ings of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how a African life will be under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; however , a deeper question is what happens when readers cannot give these images any longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media there are tens of people who have un@@ intended share , the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ary this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atrocities are un@@ true and decorate it the real atro@@ city of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of tremendous images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that this rejection of images of a wak@@ ening equ@@ ates to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images readers and audience is des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the investigations , like non@@ violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent representations in the news media , it is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists experiment on because with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will thoroughly think about the situation where a picture can suggest something suggest , which actually can also be solved in the context or completely mis@@ used manner . &quot;
&quot; however , every investigation of false supplements should be considered as internationally as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons used according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( for example , uns@@ plac@@ eable ) endeav@@ ored to provide language enthusiastic to offer a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
&quot; there are such words in every language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these uns@@ ot@@ able words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese aci@@ dic sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ k@@ esa ) .
but they are all stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly to every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; one word or an expression is not enough , why a complete explanation and sometimes something context are required to accurately understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese , or Finnish words , while the author and Lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Bem@@ ü@@ h you for your parents in recognition of how you have endeav@@ ored to help you in your younger years .
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil as : &quot;
&quot; k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - its convenience or sl@@ oth , which you feel after you have ra@@ ged on cold days in the sun . &quot;
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they compens@@ ates other cultures , un@@ veil other thought of thought and wake up our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page , and show how different , valuable and impres@@ sively these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; Red@@ ner of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by the trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite no@@ ok here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka deals with the worst fl@@ ut@@ ary disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking at the worst flood of water and lands@@ in disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which is normally committed in late May , are by strong rainf@@ alls , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya , in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster in Sri Lanka from May 28 , 2017 , 126 people were killed and nearly hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and Schl@@ amm@@ la@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected by the last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygien@@ ic dis@@ appearances of the population pose a massive challenge to the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos convey an impression of the extent of the fleet disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lan@@ kan ob@@ sc@@ ure the Den@@ gue crisis , warns us the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today tomorrow was the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus in the floo@@ ding water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da with G@@ alle also flooded because of the water @-@ tre@@ ks of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force made available five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five will be completed for the transport of emergency supplies for those in their flooded villages . &quot;
also various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have prepared to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ ar in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka deliver important information on high water supply and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and life@@ jacket for their operations require , please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to split the dry food and life @-@ needed goods for high @-@ water @-@ offering -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call today the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 84@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ et centre will be notified . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ sturb@@ ate Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; high water aid &quot; &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then passed free to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ kan Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they led a &quot; &quot; S@@ OS &quot; &quot; button that had more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat transactions to be followed by floo@@ ding and lands@@ li@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where several social @-@ media platforms are fully exploited , residents are in need in need of security and help make help . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

usage : Dam@@ as in January I participated in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
&quot; I trust her my four year old daughter , she trust me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
in the one minute we call for slo@@ gans for the rights of women .
in the next sk@@ il@@ ding we have rights for transfer .
&quot; we are located in a sea of rain@@ forest and people , some keep the i@@ con@@ ical image of a woman with a to@@ wel high , bound from an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Mus@@ lim@@ a ? &quot; , &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I am working or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they with@@ draws me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims around the world .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , to different kind . but somehow we all put in the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is in our collective imagination so well constructed that as soon as Muslims , who like I do not puri@@ fy them . &quot;
Muslim are to be dischar@@ ged
I am not alone .
&quot; this even happened to the poet , whose poetry in the United States is mostly sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come in a sense if you think of it ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was a Orthodox pre@@ acher Pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the centre of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western sense the religion of Rum@@ is was er@@ ased , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
another exists in the reduction of parti@@ tions of Muslims who have been coloni@@ alism the Western books for centuries .
&quot; this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man , who should be afraid and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
the groundbreaking Palestinian scientists Edward S@@ aid cr@@ ush the history behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures are still further forward .
&quot; our politicians , the news and Hollywood industry remains to continue . &quot;
I &apos;ve been working three years in the news industry thirteen years and I have seen how these powerful , faul@@ ty scar@@ r@@ atives dominate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades , nine Muslim women have led their countries while the United States could not even choose their first female presidential campaign . &quot;
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v failed to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from carrying out their head to@@ wel in public buildings and to cover su@@ di Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ rati@@ v weak@@ ened Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it looks like that the first Muslim prayers have been spoken by Afri@@ cans , had been killed here with slaves . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ rati@@ v has occupied our collective imagination so deep and faul@@ ty , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of tim@@ ated attacks and ra@@ ging attacks . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way we tell them is Islam@@ ophobia today not just fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1,7 billion people
in the news industry we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create Nar@@ r@@ ative that help us understand the world .
and my industry failed to grasp the Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed to do it here , where seven million Muslims have the highest level &quot; &quot; various &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my cat@@ apul@@ ted parents came to New York in order to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh , with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; then when Khan was re@@ thought of the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unavoidable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now un@@ f@@ aded Mus@@ lim@@ a and American ?
&quot; sometimes , when I ask myself why I don &apos;t eat por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some flas@@ hes that carry all Muslims - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
I Scher@@ ze we do not carry all the pocket cor@@ ps with us .
&quot; we must also be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; &quot; Muslim &quot; &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional security checks at the airport . &quot;
&quot; there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who strive to fight widespread lies on Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing band from a well @-@ drawn Islam@@ abad machine with len@@ ders , thinking tanks and experts for false information that is our already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or of what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ism exists in more than just a stranger , who under@@ lining a woman the ro@@ ud . &quot;

I would like to explain .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ lim@@ a , but a mus@@ lim@@ a was born only then in my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; describing social sciences of religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my muscle faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor , my rock in the br@@ ung see that I am Mus@@ lim@@ a if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air , that could separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the sole ritual with my daughter when I see her in my arms and her the Arabic verses for the protection of whis@@ per that are called the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
I repeat three times each of them .
&quot; I ask that they are protected from evil , the evil one you can see and the evil one you cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is not always visible , but my Muslim belonging is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a means to speak the prayers they told me , if I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ lim@@ a is to be as she taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , which God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded over centuries - by a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; coloni@@ alism , which founded a company with the name Ehr@@ ous Bri@@ tic Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means , to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time seeing that my prof@@ essed grandfather cri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the middle , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana J@@ aan has f@@ aded around his family in India ruled by Kas@@ h@@ mir family , who he was not allowed to close his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , as with my grandfather , were ri@@ pped apart from coloni@@ alists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
Mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans all have been de@@ colon@@ ized to four Muslim countries .
it means to know that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of the story was rejected in front of a century over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an intimate , k@@ ish shelter of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; because he led the first mosque in England . &quot;

&quot; to my Muslim trunk of 1,7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ ess , our in@@ tolerant history . &quot;
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops , that have been distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ c@@ tica , had gone to Iraq to im@@ itate mass destruction of mass destruction that were not existed . &quot;
it means to know that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried in the wars of the war .
&quot; an American mus@@ lim@@ a means to know that the self @-@ mor@@ phic under veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is secret the US , and the suspi@@ cious name bears the story four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , called by a free black slaves with the name of Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago , a African Islamic Emirate named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into this country . &quot;
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed as people crowded the airports in order to fight against the Muslim B@@ an .
&quot; it is the hope I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ lim@@ a and a journalist , the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tional ality of our associated with multiple bonds , but remember to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ rati@@ v of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the redu@@ ci@@ ble branches of &quot; we &quot; against them . &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people build on this branch of structural Islam@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ism exists in the Muslim registr@@ ations , which began with President Bush and expanded under President Obama . &quot;
it consists in common monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who takes five years old child into hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it consists in a country that closes its limits to people from precisely the countries that are bombar@@ ded .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; which largely takes Arabs and Muslims .
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we do not tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study called A@@ scent of Man , scientists of North@@ western University participants showed a scientific idea and b@@ ate them to judge groups on a scale from 1 to 100 on the evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations which we have to lead
&quot; we are deeply rooted in revealing the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the faul@@ ty and dangerous image prints , which we pro@@ secu@@ te in our news editorial transactions . &quot;
&quot; at least , there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry which tries to capture our often with bin@@ ed identities and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See something , S@@ ay belongs to Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the vir@@ ale Vide@@ os@@ erie Secret lives of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square on black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , multip@@ ly Muslim authors , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

&quot; but I am concerned with this difficult global time , in which we are located . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1,7 billion euros .
&quot; there is a reason that conspir@@ ators , which existed in the dark corners of the internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown expon@@ entially , because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , by creating the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , she had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and history , which I was not aware of as I was now my daughter , but which today made me a unavoidable Mus@@ lim@@ a . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread@@ crum@@ ple track in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ c@@ ctions that constitutes our humanity , likes to listen to a story where someone is being made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , Con@@ vers@@ ations will take place within the scope of the 8th annual conference on Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; over a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; other &quot; , &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot;

&quot; why don &apos;t I tell that here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who has shown us how wars are led and people through the creation of &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , four decades of which the Stan@@ ford was himself . &quot;
&quot; we need to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions after the role of this , conscious and un@@ consciously the &quot; other &quot; to solidi@@ fy ; as it is my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no president , the chocolate cake is being bombar@@ ded , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1,7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narr@@ atives wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; tell stories , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to connect here and now despite a language barrier to someone ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the Er@@ count of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently , about another initiative of Steven Bird , the un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here however , the focus of T@@ LS is not written on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language variety of major cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already been conducted for 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children . &quot;
for the creators of the project shall apply :
&quot; the mass man@@ ners of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , the diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening often is often connected with it , &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to &quot; &quot; listen to feel , establish . &quot;
in this format the stor@@ yt@@ ellers show their story first in their own language and translate them into English .
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional stor@@ yt@@ eller , they lead their devotion and their depic@@ tion to re@@ plying to the audi@@ ts . &quot;
they call out laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows for example a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the stor@@ yt@@ ellers R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou con@@ son@@ ate also the opportunity to explain the customs of narr@@ ation for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ uss of the rab@@ bit and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; when he explains the meaning of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked , &quot; How is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad gr@@ in , he shares his feeling of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling took place in three cities , and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who inspired by the project can get in contact with T@@ LS to show their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re@@ funds of state debt
&quot; with the aim of a re@@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took up to 72 million US dollars , held on the last 3 April 2017 various religious and civil organisations on a mass demonstration ; the march began at the pu@@ ert@@ al Capit@@ ol , the Government Building of the capital , and ran up to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
she was sum@@ mon@@ ed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ o p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civil front for the neur@@ on of debts ) and the A@@ kom@@ en@@ ical church in Puerto Ri@@ cos .
inter@@ c@@ essors of the re@@ traction of debt have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .

&quot; the Sy@@ r@@ isch @-@ Palestinian Web@@ develop@@ ler Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , is missing for over a year . &quot;
but it is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue to continue the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has made for an open net . &quot;
&quot; during this year &apos;s re : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is established in Berlin , devoted an event to the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;

&quot; the book , which was published last year and here is license freely available , contains a number of attempts that deal with the free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is called :
&quot; this book wishes to discuss how movements can be built for free , and what the true costs are connected with which this is connected . &quot;

&quot; this book is an attempt to liber@@ ate Bas@@ sel K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or residence . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and family a voice that seek his release , and who want to know him back in their normal life and freedom , namely immediately . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us begin to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ies , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we now here ?
what did we decide ?
what have we given up extreme beliefs in this process ?
the Web@@ Develop@@ er for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in detention by Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military facility , transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and Ombud@@ sper@@ son N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the Military Tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that it was contacted on November 12 , 2015 by persons who presented themselves as the in@@ sider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death part against her husband . &quot;
its place of residence and condition remains unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to the internet and to know the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment the manager of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes were looking forward as the work that he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras , virtual . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the sign of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture @-@ types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bas@@ sel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would put it on it , that architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike into the digital arche@@ ology and the conservation has created a period of time , which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Bas@@ sel was not able to complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I have spent my whole life with it , of freedom to dream and bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
&quot; Bas@@ sel brought me English , even when he was in custody . &quot;
I learned to read and speak English well .
he has always shared his knowledge with each who has asked him . he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English .
Bas@@ sel opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he has also taught other prisoners , as they use computer , at least theoretically , without having actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a commission that wrote them in 2012 till 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura have worked together on the book for a long time .

here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens when you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your charming eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that any of the dangers are no matter , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , bonds and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the prison quarters of the prison
and I go into every detail of your voice and words .
&quot; I am with passion for me , &quot;
when your eyes have to say well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness .
to return all the moments
and to cry over your absence and smile .
I persu@@ aded myself that I will return soon ...

Bas@@ sels &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime Bashar al @-@ Assad , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) have disappeared over 6@@ 5,000 people . &quot;
those who were arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians since 2011 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices @-@ Community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call in hope that we have to do so for the last time . &quot;
Mos@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption brought the director to prison on forec@@ ast@@ ed items
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ an re@@ acted with anger at a corrupt case , where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus , where corruption committed . &quot;
&quot; this is a result of Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other def@@ endants ( approximately 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money was from public funds from the airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , whose Council Cam@@ ba@@ za stood between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his return to the company what happened on April 19 .
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office of the Republic , which exp@@ ires the request , there would be no obstacles to Cam@@ ba@@ za when the company was not a lack of discipline after its imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not have the action good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Inte@@ gri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ blica , in short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency in an interview with the German wave , the director of the company , the director again . &quot;
&quot; it represents the lack of transparency in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system , so the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should have taken a lack of discipl@@ in@@ arity in the case of the contra@@ vention .
&quot; however , the company seems to appear and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the mos@@ aic social media , this behaviour also ref@@ uses and considers the case to be &quot; &quot; resistance &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent type , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and at least half of them eat . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company that he helped to cause damage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of policy sciences in Brazil says , the Director said no morality : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he didn &apos;t believe it I can &apos;t believe that someone has rewarded anyone in such a way that the state has already been so massive .
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead it has only served the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand , it is an in@@ exhaus@@ tible monetary source and the state itself has become a tired man who is up@@ loaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , remembering that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; Die@@ be belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ que is not only to be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , das@@ hing and - aside - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations were , when he was vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person is capable , even the father@@ land for its ambition to sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not that way . it changes the tactics , but he does not affect his ambitions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time de@@ crimin@@ ally . &quot;
in Twitter the reactions were also diver@@ ting :
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat down 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today he sets him the company , in which he mon@@ ies money , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Hol@@ iness ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) , 12 May 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the magazine @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( to German ) is proof that crime pays out in Moz@@ ambi@@ que :
&quot; in fact , in # Moz@@ ambi@@ que Die@@ z and servant of # F@@ rel@@ imo , is paying off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za has long been sentenced to possible detention , returns to # airports of Moz@@ ambi@@ que - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ Sam@@ bo ) 11 May 2017 &quot;
Facebook is blocking the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ erb@@ se or Sp@@ age .
photo of San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their po@@ sts out of the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word still is discussed , it is usually used to refer to people East @-@ Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or on the part of the field ( in bur@@ ial script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of a radical nationalist &quot; nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degra@@ ding con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is usually used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today Kal@@ ar is usually associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically calling for hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ ial words with fundamental different meanings , which have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair will be written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ us@@ er A@@ ung Ka@@ at explained the various meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether it knew how he could ease his back pain by making a word game . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the fra@@ y word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; in Win H@@ ail , the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radical nation@@ alists , but also pointed out that Facebook must be analytical before it all Po@@ sts that spread out in suspicion against racism . &quot;
&quot; Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; manually . &quot;
it fil@@ tered the word automatically .
&quot; automati@@ sm is not understood , what you write on fac@@ et . &quot;
&quot; what it should do instead , is the post to analyze carefully and control it by checking the above words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ ck@@ ery nation@@ alists spread the hate speech , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to be circumc@@ ised at the time of its nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy does not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of perc@@ ussion is often a k@@ atz@@ - and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply to start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung described on how Facebook started to delete his Po@@ sts , when he wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to accept the licensing , post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a lot of po@@ sts from people , who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate @-@ hate @-@ speaking national nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed not to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author divided his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring these words will only bring more hatred within the various communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and so as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; builder curr@@ y &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they had made mistakes , they tried to correct the wron@@ gly sol@@ dered po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover , it would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic cens@@ orship has provided for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now move about Facebook and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their po@@ sts are taken from the grid . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook Po@@ sts that have no hate speech , but nevertheless removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text is &quot; I want to sit on a chair and have a pe@@ as and an Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out whether Facebook contains the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; post : &quot; If you are a doctor , do you cure people ? &quot;
scre@@ enshot with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is to hei@@ ghten violence in the communities in Myanmar , particularly in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
&quot; fac@@ ebook was critic@@ ised for his failure , the ex@@ chan@@ g@@ able hate speech to bring about his bur@@ ial sides under control . &quot;
&quot; but rather than simply cens@@ oring the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; it would have been better with regard to context than on code focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is end with the toe
a wedding ring in the sand .

the Children &apos;s Walk is now illeg@@ ally illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country unanimously decided a law which is to for@@ bid this practice so that the capable age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of marriage , some members held a du@@ alistic and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 it came to a major public cry . at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , the leaders of the various religious groups of the country were gathered , that the state did not interfere with , as that , age not the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contract partner of the UN Children &apos;s Rights Convention , which is inferi@@ or less than 18 years of age , every man under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children , who were already married with 15 , in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago 2,@@ 8 percent , and with 18 it were 8,@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the statistical office of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys under 19 were married . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that tried to aver@@ t laws on children before , followed by the foot and pleasing great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du leader Z. B. has no concerns to say the critics of the children of children , they should be dam@@ n to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition was sor@@ ting for tension in this really uncomplicated matter , and at some stage no doubt whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; however at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , that was to be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
&quot; now only the president of the country has to agree , and to announce the law . &quot;
&quot; one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators gave on Facebook a Status update , which has posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill introduced against the Children &apos;s House was decided in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 voices , and none of them decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after having decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media @-@ media was enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws on the children were finally changed .
&quot; Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who became a ministry for the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it has too much time and unnecessary talk needed that hated the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now and this is worth any price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson of opinion was , it was definitely long enough to manage the practice was Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : , , Excellent News ! &quot;
the marriage Act has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group , which openly spoke openly about it , how important the adoption of the law was noted , &quot;
&quot; the hei@@ ghtened age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago now is independent of the freedom of religion , 18 years . &quot;
&quot; the draft of the change of the marriage law was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members of the House of Represent@@ atives in the House of Represent@@ atives and were 35 in the vote .
&quot; &quot; &quot; all members , who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the Children &apos;s before is no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long battle ( ... ) # College of marri@@ age@@ views .

&quot; but a possible hook comes in the form of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organisation of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to take into court steps , the law should be adopted ; and he seems his promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the general state @-@ owned Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , he meant that Mahar@@ aj is able to pursue the law that most social @-@ media users would like to tackle the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Vor@@ rell suggested :
&quot; dear satellite , if we , instead of talking , instead of talking about the discussion , in a way that only panic and discomfort might cause that they may be dis@@ mis@@ sive that they may be of great , hard @-@ influenced men who may be compared to them , would you then be ready to continue the discussion further ? &quot;
or do you believe that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial proceedings against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however there are still places in the world where the children are legal or continue to be the norm , even though there are laws that they say . &quot;

&quot; one solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform used all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its de@@ centralized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer @-@ Network ( i.e. machine calcul@@ ator ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and therefore a complete cens@@ orship is difficult . &quot;
the content is available despite legal prohibition however .
in a blo@@ gger post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( over the block of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put sn@@ apshots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility to read the contents of de@@ centralized and distributed manner . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to see at least all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pe@@ a.@@ org . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was done independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is only about screen@@ shots and no Live@@ - or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ navigate the sperm . &quot;
Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni from Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has led both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ dia , a Mir@@ r@@ or@@ site of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror @-@ Project that anyone can use to ho@@ vering similar Mir@@ r@@ or@@ pages when in the respective country of Wikipedia , brought forth . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices member as well as employees at Mozilla in Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Air &quot; Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a proxy address , a mirror . &quot;
&quot; one sees a different URL that is not the original . that which one can see , is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server introduces the request to the right Wikipedia @-@ side , so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is carried out by a server that is not in Turkey .
a Nepal@@ ese game photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for natural protection
&quot; a su@@ prem@@ ise of the rhin@@ ocer@@ os , Ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo of Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .
used with permission .
Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he looked around around us never satisfied . they were bl@@ ur@@ red with poorly positioned moti@@ fs and seas@@ oned colors .
motivated him to carry a camera with yourself and try to cont@@ end the situation .
at that time he was still a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is seeking to bring him to the international scene . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos , which direct the attention to Nep@@ ali wildlife . &quot;
he described Facebook how it helps him this first @-@ class situation in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world &apos;s natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly I called Navar@@ res@@ h ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had a call from my Father that would be a leop@@ ard at the shore of the Rap@@ ti river .
the river Du@@ dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I burned with my camera and was in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was up , and I immediately began to crack pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar wants to achieve cooperation with the authorities in order to gain global recognition for Nep@@ ali and like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as horri@@ fic as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I also went home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the book appeared . he immediately sat down , we see ourselves and he star@@ ed me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation ( lit . : I clicked on environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the advancement of Nep@@ ali and wild animals is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and usually lived in a tent in order to make recording at Bar@@ dia National Park recordings of Ot@@ ters . up to 12 days it took pictures until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodations . &quot;

&quot; this entry was drafted by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az in the an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing convention .
in many parts of India there are women with the greatest care to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family .
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect the husband &apos;s social pressure , as well as fear of consequences , they should ab@@ stain from the norm to this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state O@@ dish@@ a by a chim@@ ed and exp@@ elled by her family and the village community after having responded to a respectable relatives with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of wives may not name their wives as well , is also common among men . however , they have far less chance to fear when at all , they should not come back to this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , a unique club with and became quick to the main table theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community of Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , and is committed to the dismantling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist has been working with the help of her vide@@ ok@@ am@@ era at the un@@ covering of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and leads these clubs . &quot;
she reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , acted by women who did not name their hus@@ bands . &quot;
she has decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that women can easily identify with .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands , a bre@@ eder is guilty of which they have maintained all obligations and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman , who does not hold this , is regarded as a deposit , as a woman without morality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning of Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband previously on behalf of name , try out at home as it is running . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was finished .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I sol@@ vent him from now on with his name . &quot;
&quot; with this confidence in the luggage , Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club . &quot;
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some felt it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
after the video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion .
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then they asked all , &quot; If we cannot say the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , means that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equal ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ is from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra on the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women allowed the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise , a woman decided to ki@@ cked off just before itself ; a different decided to release the whole of her frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ alin rush on it , having broken with an ancient bread , decided that they would actually attempt at home their hus@@ bands in the name . &quot;
and they held their word .
the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put in the head : his wife could not stop his name . &quot;
another Kl@@ ub@@ member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she got afraid and said that there was an error . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said , I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation ar@@ ded in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the zin@@ er@@ red point on the forehead , which indicates the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why only women must show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the zin@@ er@@ red Point when he was doing it . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed only and I listened to him to wear .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but I think they are now in a better position to choose , even to wear it in some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and objectives . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will take a trip at every discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; during the last months , they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives , they danced and spoke about things which they had never thought before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been thinking about some things , such as our identities through our hus@@ bands , never so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only worn Sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most , this is okay , but some wanted a Sal@@ ad @-@ Kur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pants ; they did not trust . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ election , the morality linked to the Sar@@ is and much more , jewelry Roh@@ ini their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Upper hem@@ den ) into a discussion , so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans , and Roh@@ ini is safe to be able to create it . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things slowly come into roles : &quot;
we have done so far only small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then listened to the name of their former annes world . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , make it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are included . &quot;
only one or two remain the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
the women in the disc@@ ord@@ b know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the cra@@ ving of more freedom of movement or their own clothes @-@ election - at the end of a difficult to navig@@ ating river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the patri@@ archy .
I am there too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that not only is limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims has been de@@ capit@@ ated and some of the organs have been removed .
&quot; two men were arrested and in the episode they stood that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi . &quot;
&quot; it give the local super@@ sti@@ tion , that the head of a glorious man &apos;s gold would bring gold or wealth , the poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher stated by Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia &apos;s BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on glaz@@ ed men in Moz@@ ambi@@ que were registered .
&quot; another group , the aim of Er@@ m@@ ord@@ ons for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the UN in the South African country to investigate this internship .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring country Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tions and prejudices . &quot;

a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which probably was recently made .
&quot; this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 , Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be released as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese Dis@@ counts Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer was announced at the end of June that he had been delivered to hospital due to liver cancer .
&quot; in 2009 Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that calls for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China has called &quot; &quot; an internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a speaker , he did not require it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; but China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel Prize winner and his wife , conductor in Li@@ u X@@ ia , allowing him to allow for a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ised several reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person , however , refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure in order to treat Li@@ u abroad . &quot;
Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded , although the Norwegian Government rus@@ hed that this ultimately has nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the lau@@ ghing in China since 2010 , since the exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; once the message had spread that Li@@ u had seriously fallen ill , the Nobel Committee brought its hope for unconditional release to express and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to its imprisonment , he was not able to raise his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament adopted a decision to free in China , Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest , and permit him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top degree of diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , called for China to release Li@@ us on how it hur@@ ried in an explanation on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they shall meet all visits and receive , who wish them , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
USA
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for the treatment abroad to help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the US Embassy in China , Mary of Pol@@ ley , announced the message agency AF@@ P on June 27th , that the message granted the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u but also free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the invitation of the US message attracted an angry response from China , with the utter@@ ance of the foreign affairs , that &quot; no country has the right to interfere with and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley distributed with that China should offer the couple following :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel freely and access to the medical care of its choice , which they are entitled to comply with Chinese Constitution and legal systems , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merkel and Ted Cruz also introduced a vote in Congress to push the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally released . &quot;

&quot; the German government speaker Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; gets the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 meeting in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing of the news agency Re@@ uters , that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ ride the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John McC@@ all@@ um asked China to provide adequate medical care and give it the opportunity to take care of his family .
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ us wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia could visit him every day , but police always monitored the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to speak with someone outside , including his lawyers , speak and contact . &quot;

he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my faith that the initiatives he took and for which he was severely punished for which he had led to a harmonious , more stable and prosperous , which in turn had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;

Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may appear stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Justice Minister K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this observation has triggered a debate in blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Commerce @-@ Association of the State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody asked whether New York was a democracy ...
that is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; to rot@@ ate the logic &quot; to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable land , you can say that we are not going to be a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of a flight to the responsibilities , a mandatory violation . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons given by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , given its , it appeared in@@ inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he def@@ ends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core issue of the theme , the good old Lei@@ er appears from the author@@ itarian rulers , who pre@@ tend to be abandoned , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; during the final week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , the answers to his American guests have been given the response to his American guests regarding our press , our political system really non @-@ response . &quot;
corresponding questions tar@@ ed with non @-@ responses rational way .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to show his mind because she did not understand this conclusion .
I personally think it is a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country is part of our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our noble K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear this point , provided that he was paid highly , to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; announ@@ cing his comment on the blog he points out regarding the reviews that one should begin to read the whole writing of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the ins@@ cription .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is rather a &quot; city &quot; as a country , &quot; he explained why the election in Singapore would be as un@@ equally important , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he in Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ) .
&quot; when he said , Singapore is not a country , he obviously does not meant it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment with Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is the leader of a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am about what the Minister of Justice said to Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - whether I disagree with them or not , but that is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , Member of the new generation of the leaders of Singapore , I have doubts , and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes that he is defending . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek Review cr@@ ates the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; well@@ ed a mistake &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , to which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the cabinet , the statements of Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the schools make up their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ? &quot;
whom must our Prime Minister pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink resource we@@ eding ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this phrase seems to have anno@@ yed many of the fact ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc , &quot; but that is not entirely correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the myth of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot of a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ used aspect in your home country or home country ?
their answers will be published here as part of a continued series with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
&quot; the question , which is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you American ? &quot;
&quot; no , I am sorry , &quot; I answered . &quot; I am from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation in which situation the conversation takes place , it is regarded as polite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ ut@@ or by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fying position then usually follows the default response : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans do not cook any in@@ wardly against anger , if they are held for Americans but don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know themselves , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans have a Canadian flag clearly visible to her back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began traveling the world 20 years ago - Donald Tr@@ ump , before the march in Iraq and before 11 September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always worn small m@@ ap@@ ons in their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
simultaneous marriages in Canada have been legal since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ology . &quot;
Canada is also considered the tolerant country to ethnic groups .
we are not as these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , which I admired . &quot;
it would make me nothing if one would change me for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael made of Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; firstly : when &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be said , basically , sp@@ it to be - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle , but portable figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has an own Canadian double @-@ go@@ ers ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada would really be a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can encounter . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting to be and no attention to deserve . &quot;
&quot; that can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that pass around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a leading property of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders described as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Can@@ adi@@ ans often talk about the fence with neighbours .
&quot; we are missing the warm , open friendliness I am meanwhile connecting with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; kind . &quot; our Prime Minister has done Canada right sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ des Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band released a music video that took the jun@@ ta and restore the power in 2014 and restore the civil government , continue to restore the country . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl &quot; ) of the band Tattoo Col@@ our describes a young man who tells the rules of him his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; only within the first three days , this was the first three days shared with an up@@ loaded video 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 Li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie @-@ Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; &quot; dict@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called for the public to watch this video . &quot;
the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics as it beha@@ ves with the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule .
take a look at these recordings of videos that relate to some of the political issues which have been per@@ secuted in Thailand over the past three years .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; &quot; may refer to the dra@@ in section 44 of the provisional constitution , which provides absolute decision @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , with important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the &quot; &quot; setting @-@ change &quot; &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are regarded by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer criminal , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to try activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army , supervis@@ es the online content , and people who are thrown , the monarchy will sl@@ ander@@ ed to have stra@@ ined . &quot;
Thailand is placing a stri@@ pe against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( Maj@@ esty ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to per@@ secuted , is their decision to buy expensive sub@@ boats , although safety expert they warned that purchasing unnecessary and a waste of tax subsidies . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery car , before taking it into an interval camp , another problem problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are facing long detention centres , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ itate the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute to Pan@@ em &quot; who was already used by put@@ sch @-@ opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the gh@@ ost cities in eastern Ab@@ ch@@ Asia

&quot; the following article , written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and is published here with kind permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war period is only recovered very slowly in East @-@ East @-@ Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has now passed over 20 years , since the Georgian war officially ended , but his s@@ cars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal @-@ basin of Ab@@ ch@@ Asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ attered , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in the neighbourhood . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the largest part of Russians and har@@ n@@ oses are living in the area . &quot;
&quot; such settlements are also called Spirit @-@ Asia , as well . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ ost cities . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district 16@@ ,000 people , after a decade has hardly risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 approximately 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story dor@@ man@@ tle of the Soviet Union from the early 60s , called the Chr@@ u@@ ch@@ ha@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are dis@@ missed and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder one .
he begins a conversation and it falls hard to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is still un@@ ambiguous . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were municipal centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens that served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived on this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha approximately fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages , it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which is still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately go back . &quot;
&quot; our Mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden to us , that is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pered with her girlfriend and suddenly they leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence farming ( growing agricultural products for equity ) such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to reach the rounds .
the District management in winter provides free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman called Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to jungle . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ Asia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina would not like to accept financial assistance from her daughter and insist that she supports its young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas Mon@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other villagers are trying to meet regularly and holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; when holidays are , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do so - everybody is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; says aun@@ t G@@ alya her . &quot; they said , we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in their house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when war began .
every day she reminds himself of the thor@@ ac@@ al of war .
&quot; despite the relatives , which live in Central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ asia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently purchased land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative de@@ capit@@ al town in Ab@@ ch@@ Asia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but that will still take a little bit , &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha receives about $ 9 child allowance for every child .
your husband is working in the coal mining industry .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house , where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once there , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;
&quot; she told us that it was a very fri@@ ghtening situation , when many people left the village after the war . &quot;
but in the course of time she lost its fears .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we have no fear of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and everyone lived as it was right .
every day I remember how the city and war were once .
&quot; as our conversation comes to the end , a small boy draws us by . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ased back to him .
he plays with the ball that rolls up the hill .
a group of children now pursu@@ es the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones on the exp@@ ir@@ cul@@ ated buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which make for in@@ ad@@ versity in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it differently .

in Mexico the &quot; Mama Africa &quot; hosts migrants at their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by Amy Br@@ acken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border with Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - olds of Mex@@ i@@ kan@@ er , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink glasses and gold @-@ colored ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; she is called Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and has grown up there . nevertheless , they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
&quot; this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tian &apos;s , who are on transit . &quot;
the hotel has no more charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms , with col@@ lateral , weighing walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and ha@@ i@@ ti@@ lian migrants are here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez , the people come in full @-@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call : &quot; &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also slept outside on cardboard . &quot;
it does not want to decline anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick , they buy them drugs that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aged them with a bal@@ sam taken by the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao Family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ sta@@ che ) , with Concep@@ ción Gonz@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; you have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other gu@@ ardi@@ ans from Mama Africa . &quot; m@@ um Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; says Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the circuit together and that Afri@@ cans speak on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Mrs Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; as many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been guest for months guest at Mama Africa : he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to ticks .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; &quot; Send smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells her guests to send their often text messages when they went away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey .
she declares that her Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa but their guests have led her to prepare chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known , but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel by Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family are included in their small house . &quot;
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tian . &quot;
&quot; some sleeping on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cook@@ er outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests can do .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people can help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after being lived for three years , he was referred to a raid on his office from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that he was flying in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown , a single @-@ cat@@ er@@ ner , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
in the courses the travellers consult their phones .
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gically because of those who went away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother blowing it in their album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair@@ dr@@ ens that you made a customer in , some photos of her grand children and many travellers more , young and Old . &quot;
they laugh sad while she asked me shortly before .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repeated it every time . &quot; they have been gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang inhabitants will be forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , in the case of the case above . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minorities region in the west of China , are compelled to install a Spy@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ shan district of the City of Ur@@ um@@ qi received a mobile mail alert , in which she points the District Gover@@ ment , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app should prevent the use of terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities should use the app for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had already installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app was able to determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the blocking porno@@ graphy web pages , from online fraud , Tro@@ jan and ph@@ ishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online , and to control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle .
a app with these features can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; state players or even h@@ ackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or ste@@ al it from it . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while recording reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant , imp@@ aired ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme ten@@ ders and surveillance measures as well as rout@@ in@@ ous Internet de@@ activ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; this released on Twitter @-@ based media out@@ let &quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( above all , on the above @-@ above ) , the cens@@ ored messages released in China , showed photos of a Check@@ point , at the poli@@ cem@@ an the residents in@@ quired in@@ quired about whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian ensure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
a mobile notification required that the app will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a Check@@ point with a device without these software , it could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they are forced to use the people , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of bondage through The rest of the world .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( including the above @-@ mentioned above ) , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift the passwords requirement of a Windows operating system , and thus acqu@@ ires unlimited access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang there are computers and mobil@@ es in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
&quot; the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council , to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and the institutions connected with the institutions including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office on the operation of their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report by Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned this new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang the authorities published on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all the residents and entrepreneurs , to the 1st August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at the local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; , however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole number of other possible claims , including those who relate to peaceful religious or political communications . &quot;
sleep or death : part 1 : everything scar@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ cli@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane is sign@@ alled his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ ar to you that you are alone on a place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything turned out to be dissolved , and revealed a truth which clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes their name all the honour .
&quot; one that has turned down into a list of feelings and expressions , that allow no metaph@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; but when you get back into reality and you look behind the scenes - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and performers - the characters in beings transform themselves from flesh and blood , and everything scar@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts dis@@ solve themselves in smoke and you become aware of your existence , even though the earth is spinning on the axis of the un@@ hei@@ ls . you realize that you are caught here between walls and your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have been arrested me and my father three times , but I did not have yet , so that I &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the boss of the security services it form@@ at@@ ched - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us because he even destroyed the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were swe@@ pt away during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Al@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; all city district cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was still , rainy , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a town that has been awarded to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; at the third night , things had cal@@ med down slightly , after the power supply in the district seemed to work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the silence by crying several times &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house @-@ roof . &quot;
I heard my voice disgu@@ sting through the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to find together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined a glorious picture that filled my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you are aware that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it &apos;s not interested in the straight . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he laid on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low them - nothing can give your voice back , after you put it all the way up to the office of the Security Service out of the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I now also . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you are &quot; All@@ ahu &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not nearby . &quot;
his h@@ edge @-@ filled eyes set themselves up for me .
&quot; and you are sad to look into the eyes , and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I answered , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think , I never ceased to look into the eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in single , and his father equal to it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the st@@ ank of this cur@@ sed proposition lies in me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a spiritual torture who was exposed to monthly monthly . &quot;
I cry the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I am carrying out .
&quot; then again through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a course to the single cells . &quot;
I &apos;m looking forward to all the details just before I went to the space .
otherwise they probably have a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with just one more prisoner and must immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I took back to an old proven communication method : to beat the wall against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ stories was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ heart@@ felt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after a long hesitation , he finally answered me . &quot;
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells there was an outstanding man middle aged man who looks similar to me and called &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , there are no distinctive faces to me , and doctors are not there ; we are all only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice sounds like my sounds ? &quot;
all the answers were an existence .
perhaps he was moved into one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me , they would make him out when I stay . &quot;
liar .
&quot; gladly I would have had a bird @-@ scar@@ ring to exp@@ el all this cro@@ ws , who are lab@@ elled at the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from a distance I still hear them &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 am in the evening , always at this time the cri@@ es , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of the per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light , which presented us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ play@@ ing on 13 S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to hear .
&quot; thus the secret was paraly@@ zed : to protect the state security ahead of us and to prevent the terrorists in ourselves , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played their con@@ fes@@ sions show and sm@@ elled the narrow view of its world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , here is not a country ; it is a curse that it is called coexistence to transform the crime of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared about the audi@@ tors and tre@@ ach on Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he begins a &quot; &quot; pleasant &quot; &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions , saying , &quot; My boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life when you begin this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon find an end anyway . &quot;
I rep@@ lied not .
&quot; I have used it to me , not to answer . &quot;
I can really no longer tell when insul@@ ts and stro@@ kes have become a friendly conversation for me on an ordinary means of communication .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to it , or to be punished for it , although I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
to punishment in all their variety .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he is called the loving &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it begins with a plastic pipe which probably dates from the clo@@ acks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ iced to your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him and you cannot with@@ hold your cry . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not fell enough , which is why they had exchanged the pipe by a wire . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a trash collection or whether it belonged to normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ ed in each other to present us the , from their view , great invention of a huge cab@@ els . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still at the line . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling , and found no favor at all , which is why he was next to an electri@@ cally invited stand . &quot;
flow flo@@ wed down my whole body enough to supply my whole quarter .
&quot; my semi @-@ bare body , who was spread out on the ground , was the perfect electric leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
this must have been so around midnight .
&quot; I decided to lay down again sleeping , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; some hours went out , which came to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of a exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must become fear@@ ful worries . &quot;
&quot; be silent and walk you , you will be moved . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they execute me ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ anic R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time in the in@@ doors ; once he mu@@ g him to his canvas , back to his computer , back and back to his couch . &quot;
but what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or her with nicotine to discover lips .
&quot; he lives on the top floor of his family house , which had been among them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ ye@@ en ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years H@@ da@@ i@@ b is a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and asks their long @-@ proven opinions about gender roles , sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian people , he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only seen in his hometown Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that range from Damascus to the whole to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with its 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits , and it can suffer according to their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not open it openly , he wins a particular incl@@ ination to the US foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b regards his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , to do something with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian people &quot; - so he himself , even if he was born in Jordan , and so far never was in Palestine . &quot;
&quot; I do not think about my own living circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a human being , whereas in the waters of the Nes@@ café in two cups sho@@ ok . it is the holy month of Ramadan ; during this period it is intended for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the j@@ ord@@ anic law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a ver@@ tically hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the slaughter of the warm coffee and the wa@@ ths of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , we avoid it simple to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink water in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently the Interior Ministry has said a gig of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary parliament@@ arians who support the Islamic State Front - the j@@ ord@@ anic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual front kan@@ ers Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional norms of the country viol@@ ates the main reason for the concert . &quot;
the MP and former press spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &apos; was canc@@ eled &apos; because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many believe in addition to the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism that imp@@ lied the long @-@ proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement of Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the j@@ ord@@ anic people as &quot; &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; &quot; who continued to work for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement probably should not simply be a sei@@ z@@ ant rhet@@ oric , but actually a more and more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality reflected in Jordan , which appear clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs work . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards to Lei@@ be by providing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex .
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly crus@@ hed woman , whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust . &quot;
in the last years Jordan has increased the number of &quot; Hon@@ orary mor@@ de &apos; - the in@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , Human Rights Watch achieved its climax in 2016 ; however , that Jordan is still lacking its institutional infrastructure to assist women who tried victims of morality or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on the fight against crime from the year 1954 women , women , who are exposed to the danger of civil violence , may be de@@ tained for some years in prison , and for their release is often a long time of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity , and is well known for being dis@@ shy away from issues that are long as tab@@ lo@@ u in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , is that he is his music , the full explicit ass@@ aults on sexuality , freedom and speech is not able to separate from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I became a policy of politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack .
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Lav@@ al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
&quot; the list of songs , which are in the core political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and every other one is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can get in his words , &quot; what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ faith , he@@ ter@@ o- or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
he notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and reading and that comments on equality between LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals still were strongly cens@@ ored in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ anic Online@@ Programme Ro@@ ya , to later remember that his comments were torn down from the context , and had been cens@@ ored by his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but it was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today H@@ da@@ i@@ b is gaining open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , and represents the opinion that intolerance to homo@@ sexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentioned Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still remained in mind thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks themselves : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later work on behalf of the Cali@@ ph , could write openly about homo@@ sexuality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the Has@@ hem@@ ite Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the j@@ ord@@ anic news service received several former government ministers and members of the curriculum , with the reason they would have expressed critical about the problems with the deep in the country . &quot;
&quot; given the concert of H@@ da@@ i@@ bs , according to the point of view , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has dri@@ lled Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time as a result , but the path of progress - it looks slow , printed and inner@@ most changes . it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the j@@ ord@@ anic society . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams , like millions of other Arabs , also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreamed not only of being able to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will unite with music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streams , and artificial kind of guided democracies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to z@@ ap and therefore also resist . &quot;
&quot; this report was made by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting , which belongs to A@@ man as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories concerning the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; you suspect that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the soli@@ ds are mar@@ ched into the northeast of more than one thousand years , in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to force the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could sn@@ ap a couple of great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two months exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have long looked at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two forts have just been visible .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the &apos; Neb@@ uta Festival the only True - and to spend a breathtaking way of spending his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer Festival in the north of the country .
I was there and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high forti@@ fication was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely were outer appearance and body care as important as in this history , as they help to maintain the Peruvian youth from crimin@@ ality and to promote a legitimate job such as the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima - a region with a very high crime rate , where street smoke and illegal drug store are daily . &quot;
&quot; one in April 2017 , the survey showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe . &quot;
&quot; at the same time Peru , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance , appearance and therefore also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that these elaborate air@@ styles can be re@@ formed . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers @-@ &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts get involved with each other to show those who can see from them the most ec@@ centric L@@ ame as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile in Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions like the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located here in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people about hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor ratings for training in hair@@ dressing art , which allows them to find jobs . &quot;
motivated by this activity and the knowledgeable possibilities have seen dozens of young people that they can grab a job that is currently in fashion .
the school offered special training workshops before the start in March and reported about some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialized school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the article &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ message to guer@@ rilla fighters , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we write only love notes to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who want to give up their affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the question of the two young Colom@@ bian activists of the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Foundation Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os , from the Young Youth Youth Foundation ( letter to reconciliation ) , which encouraged young people to write letters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was a place of historical event , and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary armed forces in Colombia ) , which constitutes the longest @-@ point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; international was considered to be the sig@@ nat@@ ories of the peace treaty , as significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian is still a long way , until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , who have lived for many years in illegal camps , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric , and around the clock contributed their arms to themselves , must now be integrated into the life of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeper hatred towards guer@@ rilla fighters , it must now take into its ranks and support them when building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that young Colom@@ bian and in the integration process would have to help .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guer@@ rilla fighters to welcome them back in society .
the goal of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former guer@@ rilla warfare - which should then be delivered personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters of reconciliation was made on the world summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which was held in February 2017 in Bogot@@ á . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to speak brief with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people whom we love , on Valentine &apos;s Day , thousands of love letters , but those who need them much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent commitment . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighter of the F@@ ARC , which now finds its place in society and have to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ á . &quot;
I would never imagined that someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o region in the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogot@@ a , to transfer the letters personally . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done earlier to take the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of under@@ mines of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; &quot; told the political science student Manuela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after we passed the letters , a former fighter brought me by the camp of guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw into one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ck &quot; ( a kind of cottage , in which the guer@@ rilla fighters live ) in which I saw a guer@@ rilla fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to lay down , because next to him on the bed was a m@@ GL pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates , a deadly weapon in the thor@@ n . &quot;
&quot; I said to him anyway and asked : &quot; hello , what do they do ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful , so I answered it . and suddenly the tears went over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I embr@@ aced him very firm and set me next to the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he was pity , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters , and wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC , the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger pan@@ to@@ d was the only way to forgive him and his six brothers in front of hunger . &quot;
&quot; but now I know that there is a society outside there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
so far I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came together to a discussion . &quot;
the students were all raised up as war and the F@@ ARC already recorded in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; many years have seen how social injustice we have seen on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in that country . &quot;
&quot; for a goal of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who have never found hearing today and had no voting right , and to recognize that men that I often have seen as monsters , and even hate , even people with lovely feelings have been revers@@ ed for me , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , does hurt me . &quot;
but it comfor@@ ted me that all people - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bring us a little and a smile and a hug .
many former fighters have responded to letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ á@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ ío de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the colum@@ bi@@ ans was rep@@ ell@@ ent that after the dra@@ ining peace would prevail .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it gives inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest up for their rights . and this is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all defen@@ ders of peace - regardless of which race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , contribute to our contribution and bring victims , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence , will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people who live in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the last months over persecution s@@ ul@@ er men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ kin , depends on the thor@@ ny of the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only seen overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya &apos;s legal situation has won several months ago , after reports have been published , the wear , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the Republic have been discussed . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Ch@@ echn@@ yan authorities , the suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and they were in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ wife , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since her childhood , she felt that she was in fact a woman . &quot;
&quot; as they became growing , you became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , which was why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya had experienced by the gender equality of their land wife , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
it came out of fear for her life to end up in the US last analysis .
Sab@@ rina : I was a honorary assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I told me that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a transaction that put into trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took them without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone made by which I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them all over the internet , with my telephone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no men more in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made by the very W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
I was attacked on 10 October 2015 .
&quot; when I was here to show a few shopping cars from the back of my car , I heard a voice I agree : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did not hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a sentence , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you ch@@ and@@ spot ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I know only that there was a young man , no thirty years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up in the hospital again in the end .
apparently some women had gotten everything and started to cry out .
the man was fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two f@@ aded in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you placed - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are dep@@ rec@@ ated , since there is still my male name : but the doctor understood and placed me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his brus@@ hing door , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a k@@ au@@ lics name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , foreigners , some completely un@@ known . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the requested , to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya to prove that all that was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they had absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by moving above without the roads and I say that I had not changed my sex in Gros@@ ny , that everything was bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have bas@@ ing size C - what could I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people once said my mother on the road .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family , but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
my mother became too much and she placed a stri@@ fe around the neck .
luckily the neighbors and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved to an apartment already a few hours later under the window a car with black@@ out windows and a Num@@ eric shield with a 95 rate .
&quot; after the third time it happened , I realized that something was lazy . &quot;
my human right @-@ friends en@@ quired the Num@@ eric signs - it turned out that I was tr@@ acked .
OC Media : how have you been flying ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought her without having to register without notice , without anything . &quot;
I crum@@ bled my old SIM card and cast it into the trash .
came to the hotel and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you do not think about you , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ st . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was indeed my room number .
OC Media : do you stand in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about the gender equality . however , this is a tablet issue . &quot;
I am still wearing some traditional k@@ au@@ lics elements still in me .
&quot; so much I also wish , this sou@@ l@@ ess barrier can I not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I say always , that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me trouble like the person to see from her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what are your friends , those who have remained the dor@@ sal ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I have submitted a report to Washington last week .
&quot; for me , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I spoke to someone who had the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait , and he did not enter a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are also now being de@@ co@@ ded to men in these secret prisons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there was not so many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives , or those from their relatives were dropped to face Kad@@ y@@ rows Court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there to be present later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be converted , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked either village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply van@@ ished , but sub@@ merged to radic@@ alise itself . &quot;
OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone over the one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown .
there has since been nothing new to them .
they have taken them simply .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was self @-@ evident than these people were taken into account . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there were no reports so far . however , we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , which belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already occurred in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I had my hair ever long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already known all over Gros@@ ny , when I lived there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in the grave !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , then it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil society &quot; , &quot; ultimately , however , took us back to the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sch@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were conf@@ is@@ oned ; I had colored eyelashes , bore tube @-@ jeans and short tail . &quot;
the safety of the sh@@ aria has never been har@@ med to me only one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been bel@@ ated .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da , that is , &quot; Sp@@ otte not over the evil of another . &quot;
one often says it to children if people are funny about crane .
&quot; OC Media : so they just have their eyes closed to you because they believed , they were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
they never sinned , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace stopped ?
Sab@@ rina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about morality . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us , but above the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; who had sm@@ iled and laugh@@ ed before , viewed you at once with suspicion . &quot;
in the time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I was able to feel how the situation in the Republic has steadily increased . &quot;
OC Media : what kind of activity do you proceed ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t deserved a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , assemb@@ ling , I compre@@ h@@ ite it to the hospital and help them to get ess@@ ays . &quot;
I have no c@@ ents for it for a long time .
I have discovered these people themselves as I cl@@ ave a refuge .
I am Mus@@ lim@@ a and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is al@@ loc@@ alities .
&quot; so nature , it is purely nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to show you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no tails . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ an@@ is who have the cab@@ in@@ ers who have the Russians , also which ; on the entire planet there are they - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear . &quot;
I meet here as many men from the Caucasus .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live with men together .
&quot; you know many think about Transi@@ denti@@ ty of men who love men , and they believe that you can change his sex in order to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a tru@@ ction . &quot;
these are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to accurately be different life settings .
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry that I become so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase of suicide within the impover@@ ished Arab ancestors community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region is suffering from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; since the last few months , there is a sharp increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on 27 August decl@@ ining the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab @-@ Nazi community in Iran which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , in the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and sh@@ ed@@ ged for his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness to arise the in@@ ability for his family , thus Ah@@ mad human rights groups , who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; a video shared on YouTube gave the moments , after he had lighted himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to delete the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that the doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide , who is appropri@@ ated in August within the Arab @-@ Nazi minority , and activists on the spot warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights announces that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ king Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - who is hanging on this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : it was all family pat@@ rons , who felt helpl@@ ess@@ ly because of the persecution by the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ capable to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of the Arab ancestors living in Iran was shaken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult to dispute its liveli@@ hood . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ monarchy was taking over power and under@@ took a great effort to end the ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran &apos;s future oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most widely used and valuable utility areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and local people get only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and hard@@ ships . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime den@@ ies systematic jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab areas into the Persian territories where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are surrounded . &quot;
these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation in the region by drought causing devast@@ ation and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry .
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ torate General for Ko@@ operative , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , mel@@ ted that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who finished a job , finished 55 % a further school and 45 % a university degree . &quot;
a systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ mad human rights activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among the young ancestors . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that unemployment has become worse since unemployment . due to this , a combination of a high number of I@@ wa@@ z new ethnic Per@@ sians and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination is in the creation process : &quot;
&quot; since Func@@ tion@@ aries and institutions are not preferred to establish Arab labour , the local Arab ancestors of the access to work options in all sectors is gone . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force them to earn their living outside their homeland Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their superi@@ ors and surname to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ azi and thus be questioned , since even Arab names on the workplace will not be tolerated , let the speech of the Arabic language or wearing Arabic clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances that must endure the Arab ancestors , human rights activ@@ ist alarm , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

&quot; why I am not identifiable with femin@@ ism , nor with the inter@@ sec@@ tional struggle &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
&quot; the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i , originally published on the website of Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed . &quot;
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a femin@@ ists , many women react - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be femin@@ ist and why in general all femin@@ ists should be * inside .
&quot; for example , women today still earn less money despite equal education than men . &quot;
&quot; women are still under strict observation , when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body . &quot;
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a gl@@ oss cover earlier or later in various fields of life , and that discrimination is still drawn through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is well known and known .
I am convinced and I will be twice and triple .
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , if I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black CIS women , on black women , on black women , on black women , on black women , women , and verbal abuse have been ab@@ used , both in and outside of feminist movement , to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women - should come together to up@@ lift their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my lord &apos; to sing the equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we are exposed to black women at two times . &quot;
&quot; in fact , black women and women from other eth@@ ni@@ cities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women . &quot;
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with migrant background are exposed to a higher risk , domestic violence and violence are exposed to the partnership as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all the men , and at all men , any skin color , who have the same rights ; on the other hand I can consider myself as a black woman , in whose center the white woman stands to take into account in@@ justi@@ ces in their thinking , which relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; So@@ ap compl@@ ained in his speech : &quot; &quot; I am not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refused to maintain an ideology , in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ized and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I devi@@ ate myself to join the group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , to drive their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to seize white women the importance of over@@ cutting of skin color and sex . for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to honor them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to deny yourself from the white femin@@ ism , is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself fully from femin@@ ism and join me to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of being stub@@ born to a white @-@ feminist paradigm , that is so stub@@ born that inter@@ sec@@ tional phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres , which will be created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ an Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana ha : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we can defend ourselves , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , spiritual , physical and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists will immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after they read these lines , I ask you to inform about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment I can up@@ lift black women and women from other cultures , as in this paradigm I am existent . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can blo@@ om in an environment where my life is neither crossed nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
pad@@ del@@ ve against contamination : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reported in particular about international efforts to solve environmental issues . &quot;
as part of a content sharing agreement this article is again published here .
&quot; over the past 7 years , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with Surf@@ boards or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains to us his relationship to the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its community .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Water@@ ke@@ ty Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ man Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a sums up the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water more , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , document@@ aries and multi@@ medi@@ al journalist , filmed and edited . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on per@@ secuted , little considerable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multi@@ medi@@ al techniques that can tell their stories in their way . &quot;
Paraguay &apos;s Women and her difficult fight against violence
&quot; a group of women is &quot; &quot; The crying women &quot; &quot; in order to express their pain about women &apos;s mur@@ ders in the country and in the region and to show their rejection . &quot;

the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # Christmas @-@ women &apos;s ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most of the names were changed to protect the persons concerned .
&quot; a police commander said A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , that she was nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex@@ partner who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship has passed a little time and the police said , her statement would be put to the files , but more could not do . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed for abuse , also the acoustic indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez nothing . &quot;
a few days later the second woman moved their ad .
to break the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women at all once adver@@ t ad , they generally do not receive support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases women are also dependent on men which they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who have to admit , to be victims of violence , to comply with the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; inhal@@ t@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 inv@@ itations and a legal system that is nothing lower than 3 Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation of stro@@ kes and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ á@@ lez , researcher for comrades on the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studio , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even accum@@ ulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the numbers available are however alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 at the District @-@ state office 9@@ 600 ads went for domestic violence . at 70 % of them , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there have been more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace process . also here , 86 % of the ads came from women . &quot;
&quot; in the ads said 40 % of women , that they have become physically mi@@ dd@@ led , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen women Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these criminal off@@ ences are also actually shown . &quot; to any woman who are re@@ funded in Paraguay because of psych@@ ic mis@@ sal display , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; every woman who is re@@ funded due to physical abuse , come two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide in Paraguay is not a private criminal , cannot document the law enforcement authorities as many women killed each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 , journalists were at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country alone . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men . &quot;

invisible distr@@ acts and a legal system that is doing nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z was the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then after . this should not regret it forever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but two years she carried the mental force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable : &quot;
I would never thought that I would have been victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only women had happened to be sub@@ servi@@ ced because they can be fool@@ ed by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during their two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated it . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , if he ever asked the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour has also been a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen the so long from Carlos and left him not before .
&quot; it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner sm@@ iled it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) , which consists of women who are all victims of abuse . &quot;
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner managed eventually even to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as advertisements in the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she introduced a process against her former partner who developed into an un@@ man@@ age@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and her native country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paraguay laws : good approach , lack of implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but are not applied . &quot;
&quot; the display of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary , &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also looks great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # Princess ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the motion # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
&quot; the original design of the law fores@@ ees to explain to a peculiar criminal off@@ ences , and to pun@@ ish tougher as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia . &quot;
&quot; thus the legislative text was altered in some points in order to also win the MPs for the Law , who feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is generally prohibited , which is generally prohibited in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill introduced most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) procedures that must carry the victims of violence at present , if they just want to reimbur@@ se an ad and receive a secure accommodation to abandon the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legis@@ lature does not provide sufficient funds to do so : &quot;
in Paraguay it is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
&quot; here , a change must take place , so that violence will no longer be regarded as a slightly Nor@@ mal . &quot;
&quot; those who are silent in the face of these facts , makes itself guilty and helps to run away the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; we must refund such a long indication , until the abuse is no longer considered normal . &quot;
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law in the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate has been adopted . previously , parts of the law were changed however , and among other things , a passage was rep@@ ain@@ ted , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation has been seen as an opportunity for aggres@@ sor to attack his sacrifice again .
&quot; the strike of words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in O@@ man continues to ban a year after prohibition of a newspaper
&quot; this website was blocked because of a pro@@ lus@@ hy of the Information Minister &quot; , &quot; on the homepage of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
more than a year the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their coverage on corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a one year old prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and brought to judgment later . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been governed by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power since he had his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has been disgu@@ ised by his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , commander of the Defence Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of sult@@ ans is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , in particular of domestic secrecy , public freedoms , including press freedom , to intimi@@ dation and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limiting peaceful and legitimate activities in human rights , systematically and hin@@ ders citizens , also activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) since its inception in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibrahim al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor of Az@@ am@@ n , held in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ level parties &quot; hands of the judiciary . &quot; in this , it was about corruption in the judiciary , and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man to have put pressure on a judgment in an inheritance tax . &quot;
&quot; edition of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 , with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ level parties bound the hands of the judiciary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ al Al @-@ Abr@@ i , Member of the Board of Board , was charged with the ISS before the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS he accepted the Deputy Chief of Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acts according to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest as editor @-@ in @-@ chief .
&quot; the paper was closed at a certain time after the Minister of Defense had given the statement , that &quot; the publication and spread of the newspaper on any way , including online , from 9 August 2016 prohibited . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the Court condemned the three journalists to prison terms , and also orda@@ ined the final closing of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in other words , Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned by public order , abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , Al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a public ban and sl@@ ander@@ ing for guilty . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and money @-@ bearing in the amount of 3000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition , a one @-@ year career ban was imposed against the two journalists . &quot;
&quot; Al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fin@@ es amoun@@ ted to 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after having the use &quot; &quot; a information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a b@@ ail was set in the amount of 5000 om@@ anic ri@@ al ( 13 000 dollars ) and he was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment . &quot;
the Appe@@ al Court said Al @-@ Abr@@ i in a hearing on 26 December 2016 sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the promise of his six months prison sentence in mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j continues to be in prison where he served his one year old prison sentence .
the Appe@@ al Court also highlighted the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the paper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to permit Az@@ am@@ n again , the newspaper still looks exposed to attacks by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information received a statement , with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister minister personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three extra months , and the Minister gave himself another time against the decision of the appeal , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the continuing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in O@@ man has recently been violated the press freedom .
&quot; for example , the closing of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country , its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the continuous closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisonment of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ st Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally free ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work . &quot;
3 . protect freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances make sure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can perform their right human rights work , and without fear of compensation , including judicial lay@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in bor@@ dering states , by promoting the freedom of opinion and freedom of opinion , supported and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understanding
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or 2016 in Zambia and Grap@@ hic is made with his consent
medical research in Africa is rarely seen or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent .
&quot; for the need for local medical research there are two reasons : for a lack in the range of global healthcare , lots of medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is conducted by African scientists , in building own research capacity in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the centr@@ al@@ ab@@ or at the center for the study of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic first demonstrated the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he researched the HIV virus before it decided to go back home to support the sam@@ ic health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ ors discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about confusion about these research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : in the moment the focus of my work on the application of research results . in this way I support the sam@@ ic national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with lab tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
G@@ V : what are your opinion about the important current scientific themes in your country and in general in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we just put solutions to have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always stay recei@@ vers rather than to be makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often not usable in our surroundings , and sometimes it is even impossible to use it here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are encouraged differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , as financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how big is your opinion on the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; the social sciences , computer science , big data , research of the outer , health care ( not transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa across Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; r@@ w : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and created access to scientific expertise that pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines are accessible only against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky originally appeared on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reported about solution possibilities for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been ch@@ aired in the USA for the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ der , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity , and the question how many sal@@ ut@@ ors can get , borders . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s he noted that more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he was not able to use them for breeding . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for single varieties , but also for certain characteristics as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or curved leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been signed on more plants such as cereals or cart@@ el varieties . due to these trends , plant breeding , environ@@ ment@@ alist and expert food safety provide food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still salad , but it &apos;s no longer necessary since his work is getting more and more challenging due to increasing constraints . &quot;
&quot; it is , when in a river there would be a rock bro@@ w , around which I must bud@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they with@@ stand at court , no one can breed any more new sal@@ ads because all the characteristics are already patented . so he is doing so well as possible and tries to ch@@ urn the characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and tries to use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space station ISS have bred red Rö@@ mer@@ sal@@ at of the variety Out@@ red@@ der in the &quot; green@@ house &quot; of the station bred and eaten . there will be tested whether plants grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that , than the movement from the IT field , and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copyright protected software . &quot;
&quot; it was launched in life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , thus permanently usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , U.S. breeders have to commit to that others can use the seeds freely from them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with its seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders only permit others to breed their seeds , to breed , and to pick it out immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , seeds will play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only use little by raising seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; Open Source &quot; movement is not busy with genetically modified crops .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; who wants to buy good , locally and sustainable producing vegetables , which is offered in August or September 2016 , should also know that the way it is bred on farms , such as this vegetable is bred . &quot;
&quot; food sovereign without seed , is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ple@@ dge to make others their seeds freely available . thus , their approach is in contrast to the seeds , seeds and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo of Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supplies is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the available gene pool due to the increasing wealth of intellectual property law on plant material , which is therefore always limited , inc@@ ess@@ ant . &quot;
Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD &apos;s work with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about one third of all cart@@ els features as intellectual property is protected either at all or not only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ aged plants like wheat in a large scale are patented as a salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such , through which their taste or color improves up to such , due to which they flour@@ ish in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents . genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before , since the changed conditions are far worse from climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Mon@@ santo speaker in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to , that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for mon@@ san@@ tos activities . with a total of four comrades and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to preserving the genetic variety . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property other breeders is restric@@ ting , since &quot; patents and the protection of plant vari@@ e@@ ders promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken up a plan that anyone can follow , as soon as the patent is up . &quot;
often these instructions can help others with another method to get the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes them by being made available to the public more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years to wait , until a patent flow , it is certainly not a innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you need to wait for so long to be able to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , the struggle would have been lost . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is however , that genetic resources were always a general public and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ est incentives have not been attractive for us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it will make us impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es on the concept to document plant characteristics : &quot; &quot; we do not create the characteristics really ourselves . &quot;
the plants they form themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Os@@ si Board , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who is a variety , he also produces his own values into them . &quot;
those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures needed for growing Her@@ bi@@ cide that are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture .
&quot; my concept is accurate . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Z. B. Mon@@ santo are ) patents have to survive , either they refuse the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case . &quot;
the independent seed company Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in its breeding garden sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton also believes that breeders would be innovative in the prevention of plant pat@@ ently , &quot; It looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies . &quot;
&quot; I need constantly new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent for 20 years in front of competition , what makes it pretty easy for my opinion . &quot;
&quot; although the United States seem to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading quickly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture ( Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed program , working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come in &quot; open source &quot; seed , and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German Association Agre@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si duty for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for bre@@ eder vary from country to country , present for the Os@@ si duty , not just one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , explains that conven@@ tionally bred plants not pat@@ ent@@ able to be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent . &quot;
&quot; yet an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the member states of the Member States , to implement the patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch Organization of Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on the farmers , operator of seed banks and seed companies from all Eastern Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; Program of &apos; Open Source &apos; seed systems , that the organization currently announces a global alliance for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , for the planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit development organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , launched a report from aid agencies such as W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - a report published , it represents the possibility that farmers will have the opportunity to collaborate and ensure a stable supply of food . &quot;
&quot; in the report also empha@@ sizes the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that it will soon recognize more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food is especially respected where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a part , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to make people clear that there are even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of cens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locks the Egyptian authorities content on the internet .
&quot; this time , it met the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend at the 05.@@ August , the Egyptian Government documents the website of the Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; August , the network released an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed sharply for this step , and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Network for Human Rights Information Protection - despite this attack and the mo@@ ck of the Egyptian right and the constitution by the authorities , to defend freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , so it has never been as difficult as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI confirms that all technical possibilities have been exhausted to overcome the blocking and not to follow . we insist that our task continues to fulfil . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities block the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , and the emerging network of Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to the blog of the colum@@ nis@@ ts and Human Rights Research Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada blog . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada uses his blog for the dissemination of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he does not write in Egypt with accessible websites and media . &quot;
&quot; now the blog , which he arranged to b@@ ypass the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ g@@ gers , the provider where the Chinese blog is home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
in a Facebook comment Zi@@ ada vo@@ iced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him :
&quot; the blogs to block is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , then it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the feeling of an ins@@ cription : a arrest , a tried murder , discharge on the national Security Council , the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to deal with the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the mu@@ te go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities from 24 May to 06 . August 133 websites . this took technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of suppliers , which was possible by the en@@ rol@@ ment of internet @-@ sur and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of web pages , the V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such practices refer to the intention of the government to block content , to block content , to access the Egyptian users . &quot;
&quot; the situation is additionally wor@@ sen that the cens@@ ored decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis for the Egyptian people to proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers report all over Brazil with a whis@@ per headlines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous post@@ cards . &quot;
some of these headlines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; E@@ ach second day will be murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rus@@ hed pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest status for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian government Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene .
reports as these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; thus published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio well @-@ known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August the editorial &quot; &quot; This is not normal &quot; , &quot; in which she announced to set up a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder , rob@@ bery , sex break , etc . all , which happens from the civili@@ zed standard and what only happened in Rio , is going to call in the heading &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief stated that this decision is no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that doesn &apos;t realize the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper explains that it is according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 areas which are controlled by criminal organizations . &quot;
in the editorial the newspaper writes on :
&quot; we are aware that a war exchange rate , when it is distorted , can also be used to dis@@ miss the police , who only sho@@ ots and then asks questions to forgive . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose objective is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; be more than they use@@ t ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist was argued in Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police . &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ reliance of public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia is false : &quot; 22 of the thirty most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 to the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ dr@@ ates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; specially belongs to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company of South America , which , like Cec@@ í@@ lia , has repeatedly stressed the policy of the state since years . &quot;
&quot; these safer measures also belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer a Fav@@ ela and permanently stop a unit permanently there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP should actually protect the U@@ PP and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist João Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from 2010 , in which he explains why the violence in Rio is not defined - by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; Civil War . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as war is also serious consequences for the people after themselves . &quot;
&quot; for this demands the state to use the means and paths that are typical of a war . in this respect the inv@@ ading into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the countryside and is an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; ir@@ oned bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or her , fact is that the inhabitants of Fav@@ elas continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; one week it is now that the police officers the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all these violence , this incident also made headlines : an or@@ ist died as a result of shots that the police had fired from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 , and in the following civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal si@@ ege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the peace organisation Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around one million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; especially strongly affected , the East G@@ hou@@ ta region , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition pass from , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practi@@ sed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these have been controlled by rebels controlled areas outside Damascus by si@@ ege , which led to them to be dependent on local people or through tunnels and check@@ points . &quot;
&quot; through years of long block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tainable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ acceptance , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ tas , as they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ ni@@ da and lead the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to the conventional , cultivated foods and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their nutritional value makes it an attractive food source for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the Ski@@ p of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose the cultivation of fungi , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that has been fought for three years to announce this project and pressed his relief that it gains more and more &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as , the humanitarian Cro@@ w@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families with knowledge to planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes a Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the fuel surcharge , locally produced fuel will be used for plastic to provide the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices , that they started producing the &quot; &quot; production from the regions &quot; , &quot; before they check their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , they planted a small mushroom in a tub . as this managed , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have been distributed free of charge throughout the east G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; : split the si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
&quot; spread of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating remains ( like paper , tea , coffee , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their homes .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea around the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the si@@ ege is visible . &quot;
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help mankind .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillars in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were r@@ amp@@ ed in the north of Portugal .
&quot; forty @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days a member state . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region where there were 4 deaths .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire@@ erup@@ tions , spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , there were a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European fores@@ try system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite images , are burned alone in Portugal for about 500,000 acres of forest - an area of the size of the district Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal &apos;s tru@@ sts in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15th October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter @-@ users shared images :
this is Bra@@ ga today night . # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal # Bra@@ ga # Fo@@ g@@ os@@ PT
numerous videos spread in the web and show pictures that allow better insights into the event :
the Provi@@ dence tragedy
the goal of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better pre@@ conditions and fire fighting measures by the state .
the people asked themselves why civil protection was not able to include the scale of the tragedy as much as possible
João Sover@@ al by the Government of the farmers of Portugal explained the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Pedr@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; on this Sunday , they did not do this nowhere : there are d@@ utz@@ end@@ ous reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen again as in June , as the streets were blocked very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits in ec@@ clesi@@ as@@ ures are questioned with a high risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; a wide @-@ sufficient proposal to the Wal@@ dre@@ form , which had brought the government after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law which allowed the toxicity of case to fall , if the applicant was permitted to protect the means of self protection - that was an open back@@ door , so everything was built , &quot; holds João Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus , trees of slightly inflamm@@ able wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , gradually spread to fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these problems occur that the website of the civil protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , when local information were seeking or trying to contact relatives , to contact relatives . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : it used its own civil protection data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and the spread of fires . &quot;

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan was a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central @-@ gh@@ an@@ istan for the last time with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it then , she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
in the morning gray one should break up the boy .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the tractor .

Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated party E@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ DAT had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt safe . &quot;
the Taliban famous for their hate at Haz@@ ara was getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked in a carbon pit for a couple of years . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took what was left of his little reward , and went into Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wing s@@ acks with mor@@ tar , the he@@ avier than he himself to make his liveli@@ hood . &quot;
back then as today the af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran was shaped by misery and exploitation .
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; reminded A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the site , on which we worked also . &quot;
there was no services there and no heating . we dro@@ wned n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so we do not refres@@ hed at night .
after four years A@@ shar@@ af allowed his life without papers in Iran and made himself ready for the trip to Europe .
&quot; on the dangerous crossing in the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and stran@@ gled on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af 2002 came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church divided twice a day eating in aid . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy has a second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions , the asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ation Union for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ mp@@ tu facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated for asylum seekers only if they officially submit an application for asylum , which may be banned even monthly after the registration of asylum . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who don &apos;t have money for an accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the street . &quot;
&quot; thus , it is also A@@ shar@@ af . &quot;
but his infinite spirits helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions soon .
&quot; having made various works in the construction sector for several years , the A@@ shar@@ af hidden his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a bu@@ el@@ lim@@ b .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis success story is now theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
the film was awarded the Venice City Award in 2017 .

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years some of Afgh@@ ans have emerged , including cutting plants , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience , where the waiter and the kitchen staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their trip to Italy . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the Pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi Restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k &apos;s goals , however , reach far beyond the Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y industry and the retailers and aim to go back to the country that he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happy if I know that my people suffer .
&quot; I am planning a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ged plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which people can sell packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; &quot; so they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
the success of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubts but in the end stand stability and prosperity .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ver Report : de@@ cent@@ ed out of Egypt will allow off social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in custody . &quot;

&quot; the Egyptian Parliament checks a bill , which pre@@ sees that users can use social media like Twitter or Facebook only after registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users need to be able to use social networks within six months following a successful law firm on the website of the authority , indicating its full name and reference number . &quot;
who has failed to fail this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or detention of a criminal payment .
&quot; the Law , which was advertised by sixty parliament@@ arians members , is currently under the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament , and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; may , another member of Member States reached a law proposal that would be introduced in the har@@ dening pen@@ alties of the President or the High Authority . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ ting of the President and government institutions is already criminal . under the law Commission , such a fact would be punished with prison and w@@ aging , so justification from the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years imprisonment for the judgment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 , while opposing violence against demonstrators , which had led to the counterpart of President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 Protest@@ ants who were arrested in the same incident , four years in detention to a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to the 20th May , because the prison line according to human rights groups was instruc@@ ted to bring the accused of detention to prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups , agreement , of other weapons , illegal assembly , murder and tried murder . &quot;
in another case a Criminal Court referred to in G@@ iza the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indicted for their reporting on the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ ń@@ ya Square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , which were also arrested for the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists to inter@@ ro@@ gated documents
&quot; in May Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the hearing of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly supported by the President of the Republic , who was expressly supported by the President of the Republic , who res@@ igned according to the Plan of the Federal Republic by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption of accused officers , provided that these all un@@ justi@@ fiable funds will return . &quot;
&quot; the document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s document , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the law will look like . &quot;
Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the disclosure of its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian Press protocol which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources .
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the District Court in Tunis on 09 . may as a witness in the case . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their ID .
&quot; according to new regulations of the state office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users need social media in China before writing or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analy@@ st assume that through the elimination of anonymous comments in conversation within the social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese grid citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations , in order to protect civil journalism and independence . &quot;

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or reconc@@ iled We@@ Chat , to register with the local government as &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government introduces a list of online services that will organise the &quot; &quot; publication of the information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to denoun@@ ce the services responsible for removing content and to force them on request for the suspension of user data . &quot;

Turkish Court has Sper@@ m Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a tur@@ quoise dish had the blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and Communication had been locked , the site had been locked because they work on &quot; a source of information which collabor@@ ates with groups in order to associate a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is , besides , in addition to China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop her@@ edi@@ ble
&quot; following this week , the British Government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased monitoring materials , the internet service provider , which would force communication in real time and to install back@@ door programs , encryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services relating to the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation is still running up to 19 May . the reactions and suggestions by members of the public can be forwarded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
