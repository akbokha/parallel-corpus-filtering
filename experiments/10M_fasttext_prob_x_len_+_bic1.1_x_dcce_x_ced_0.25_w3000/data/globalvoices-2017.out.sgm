<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is tremendous.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I grew up with American films, have danced to American music, American authors read and operated his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a very profound impact on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"when 14 years I saw the great Denzel Washington, like he played the Gray Grantham in The Pellet letter, a terrible reporter with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued, who served his interest to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free according to Method Man," I was, as if the absolute truth is, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only reinforced my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even wrote a very blackish love of its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as it deals with his bottapping.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks about how a former colleague express it, and declare publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people have reacted to his statements and voted for him in Shar."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes received by the Republican elections, was the highest number one ever reached by the Party's nominee candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigotte person why I asked myself?</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalist program, which people from around the world took up a deep-hearted man with whom I talked about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mumps of worldview not agreed by Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer "." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our joint love for basketball, and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps Inintolerance also stands in contrast to the generosity that I experienced in Sandy Bahr, who fights their lives long the environment, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me as their son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and my colleagues helped to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot at my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those through them embodied values deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"during Trump his way to the nominee of Republican Presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps especially because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the discussion with the idea that people have voted for Trump, because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to overlook these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to describe the Trump-voters as a racist.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">"this is superficial and respectful, and indicates a inability to understand those who act in a different way and think."</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows the people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most white are tuned for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick who commentated the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt for those who look differently from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Anm.).: as much as" Reception of the White to all other ethnicities "; wording of white in terms of white and whiplash, as it was the great Van Jones, has just killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether the myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - which faith or background you may have, America is called every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land, as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners, whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white America's promise of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America, after 9 / 11 the white man is back on the ruin, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"for all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word-change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would have my son, captain Humayun Kahn, a place in your America?" asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a loud" "no!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"if Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" "brood the amount."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "I answered them."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" "they called them and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a lonely and voicing "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan closed with the words:" God be thanks, Mr. Trump, that is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now mumps," "said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">And all the people that look like Mr. Khan could not find place in this new America.</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguaean city Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played at both places not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a huge garbage dump, just 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La Banda de Música (MusikBande) has now played a symphony orchestra in the municipality: a way to overcome them with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the municipality, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a random meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and the youth thus offered a rare hopelessness.</seg>
<seg id="78">The young bandmembers are taking their obligations to the music group very seriously and means the local press notcias Oaxaca NVI.</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come out of school, they go back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to follow their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they come close and play with gleaming eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, flute, penthouse, penises and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from the trash</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village which is practically located above at the biggest garbage dump of Asuncion in Paraguay's capital - on instruments that are made from regaining waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"playing with reprepared instruments, made from local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura where the recycling under the direction of Favio Chávez have started to transform parts of the fall into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate Gown, violas, violas, bass, bass, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion who were all produced from the rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of The Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times Favio Chávez, a local economist and musician instructor of the children of Cateura, at the initial time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no space for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where parents worked in the trash. children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio somewhat what he had never seen before: one out of waste-made violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">Today there is a whole orchestra playing on instruments coming from again prepared material and that is called The Recycling Orchestra.</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmony" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world creates about one billion tons of garbage."</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like the people of Cateura. Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra has even played his music before Pope Francis.</seg>

<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-release happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was then known that this ship had already operated ilblasts by illegal fishing, before it was the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a legislative brecher of this species at its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to give him one of their harbours and refused to give him a fishing village."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries which you simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisheries authority. it is part of a team that discovered the ship again and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: he did not succeed to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, because of plundering of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which protects criminal practices and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing stop)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries that at that time had driven the Premier of their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are like-minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where it is illegal fishing, "" says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending illegal Fishing. this project provides FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, present because it is extremely difficult to trace. so, the illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing from regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"through the intentional contempt of existing laws, by which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystems can harm that a delicate equilibrium."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, while actions against illegal fisheries were once affected by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snowfluso, with the information between individual countries, the actions today occur in real time, with traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can communicate with each other for example lists of existing licenses, updates to suspicious activities or details that one had noticed or experienced during a harbour."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible to identify the authorities, ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such as suspects discover - about those who indicate that a ship invites its full fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such studies can show whether the involved ships have a fish license where they were traveling and possibly also whether they have a criminal spirits."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries which are against illegal fishing, may refuse the adoption of such ships in their ports, which means that ships can not sell their charge. and that they can even be forced to numbers of punishment as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's then about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is financially supported."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, leading Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the previously mentioned platform was created to win over 20 million USD in lost sales, which increase the eight members of the network HISH-i each year because of illegal fishermen that penetrate into East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish, present to the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also seven illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include such activities such as the sailing under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, indicating fantasies, the fish-protected species and the fish in reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they specifically take advantage of the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-incomplete control system," "says Long." "earlier there was a ship illegally fishing and a country could then say 'You dared not to run my harbour."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and exactly this legale hatch tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front does not work.</seg>
<seg id="126">FISH-i participated in more than 30 examinations of suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, the fake licenses used in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has been prosecuted and found fleeting ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crimes, FISH-i may share information on illegal fishing over large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime "," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system that is to help FISH-i, suspects ships more precise."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always further developed, will also help to split the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO which also deals with fisheries data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships turn off for example their automatic identification systems, giving them no longer of satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"copeland helps therefore to build a system that connects various information levels with each other. it should help FISH-i to find criminally agile ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch, together with Google and the Sea Organization of Oceana: a platform that offers satellite data and can be shown by means of the position of every single traceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join forces with neighbours to get a better picture of what is doing - this is simply meaning "," he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project to run in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities can not only feel criminals but they too.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships used earlier without a license and had little to reckon with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i countries meanwhile have a 33% increase in fishing sales, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped, Greko 1 opened up doors, the inspectors found there on board hauling networks, whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with kind permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars will disappear by illegal fishing every year."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there are six countries collapsed, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting for illegal fishing, according to the same model such as FISH-i." "With security, the goal is to develop even more such initiatives and structures in other regions", "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia could report from Somalia: in October it was Greko 1, a ship that was under false flag. and not only was the ship used without a license, and were used by hauling networks, which are now prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in forbidden waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1 put a strong sign that they will proceed against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative effort to protect the oceans actually works throughout the world sea. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. she writes on the subject of environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>
<seg id="152">"their articles appear in the Wired Magazine, TED Education, the New York Times and in the Guardian. situation in Venezuela is moving forward to: demonstrations in several cities with the aim of capture the country"</seg>
<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations.</seg>

<seg id="158">Under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (e.g.: the return of Venezuela) can be found both pictures of these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them.</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the lowland area Barinas, in the Andes-regions Mérida and Táchira, centrally located north-north of Carabobo and on Isla Margarita at the federal state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis, in which the inflation and violence belong to the highest around the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for annual financial statements) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine was the only way to restore its institutional structures and to close a new governance."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to overhead, one needs two important skills: passive language skills to understand the starting text and active language skills to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is in case with native language. in general, the conviction that translators is in the target language - not in the initial language - native language should be."</seg>
<seg id="379">"thus, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from the French into English."</seg>

<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ workers with English as a mother tongue, the translations into English. this may be misled by understanding of the overputting, cost-grounds or the relatively small number of English speakers, the Japanese learning."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies that even have no foreign employees, translations can still produce firing internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are perceived as the best ones, for translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo of Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrated and puzzling phrases that are created by machine translation, show that this technology can not replace a human translator for a long time. this applies to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often used T-shirts or bags, are used only for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be as jewelry yet acceptable or at least harmless. but from large companies or from the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="786">"for me it is, as if they decayed those who have lost someone and those who have fear that they have happened so something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if telling stories about bloating numbers in a statistic.</seg>

<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo has been applied several times on social media, blogs and other platforms, but not in the context of the tragedies, particularly events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>

<seg id="1137">"for Steven Bird and Robyn Perry, founder of the Treasure Language Storytelling (TLS), the Ercount of stories in their original language is a possible answer."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"global Voices reported recently, about another initiative of Steven Bird, the untranslatable blog."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"here however, the focus of TLS is not written on the written word, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to obtain and appreciate the language variety of major cities."</seg>

<seg id="1142">"the mass manners of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities, the diversity - secure spaces where inhabitants do not have to forget who they are."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening often is often connected with it," "these events instead" "listen to" "listen to feel, establish."</seg>
<seg id="1144">In this format the storytellers show their story first in their own language and translate them into English.</seg>

<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment the manager of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes were looking forward as the work that he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras, virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the sign of numerous civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture-types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would put it on it, that architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strike into the digital archeology and the conservation has created a period of time, which will be invaluable for the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"in particular, Bassel was not able to complete this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi has also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I have spent my whole life with it, of freedom to dream and bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel brought me English, even when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">He has always shared his knowledge with each who has asked him. he has taught other prisoners to read and speak English.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the gate to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he has also taught other prisoners, as they use computer, at least theoretically, without having actually holding one in their hands."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambian reacted with anger at a corrupt case, where a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus, where corruption committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is a result of Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and was sentenced to 22 years in prison with four other defendants (approximately 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money was from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, whose Council Cambaza stood between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 because of good guidance and immediately requested his return to the company what happened on April 19.</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General Prosecutor's Office of the Republic, which expires the request, there would be no obstacles to Cambaza when the company was not a lack of discipline after its imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not have the action good."</seg>

<seg id="1262">"it represents the lack of transparency in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a step towards the efforts of our legal system, so the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should have taken a lack of disciplinarity in the case of the contravention.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company seems to appear and prompted no appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the mosaic social media, this behaviour also refuses and considers the case to be" "resistance" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent type, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and at least half of them eat."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polishing his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he agreed to be reintegrated into the company that he helped to cause damage."</seg>

<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead it has only served the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a hand, it is an inexhaustible monetary source and the state itself has become a tired man who is uploaded and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>

<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts out of the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word still is discussed, it is usually used to refer to people East-Indian origin or generally used as an adjective." "</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or on the part of the field (in burial script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of a radical nationalist "nationalist movements has given the word an extremely degrading connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is usually used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today Kalar is usually associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically calling for hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts expressed in his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burial words with fundamental different meanings, which have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair will be written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spage) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebookuser Aung Kaat explained the various meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a spiritual way whether it knew how he could ease his back pain by making a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the fray word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"in Win Hail, the opinion that it will reduce hate speech radical nationalists, but also pointed out that Facebook must be analytical before it all Posts that spread out in suspicion against racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Facebook deletes the word" "Kalar" "manually."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filtered the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">"automatism is not understood, what you write on facet."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"what it should do instead, is the post to analyze carefully and control it by checking the above words."</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-ckery nationalists spread the hate speech, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to be circumcised at the time of its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy does not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of percussion is often a katz- and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply to start to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung described on how Facebook started to delete his Posts, when he wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive on Facebook, I made a post to share my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to accept the licensing, post and parts of content for 24 hours because of the post" "Facebook Community standards". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has a lot of posts from people, who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate-hate-speaking national nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed not to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author divided his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to decrease racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring these words will only bring more hatred within the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and so as" chair "or" builder curry "." "</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they had made mistakes, they tried to correct the wrongly soldered posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a great turnover, it would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks automatic censorship has provided for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now move about Facebook and write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the grid."</seg>

<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing convention.</seg>

<seg id="1475">"the tradition of wives may not name their wives as well, is also common among men. however, they have far less chance to fear when at all, they should not come back to this practice."</seg>

<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community of Video Volunteers, and is committed to the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paist has been working with the help of her videokamera at the uncovering of practices, such as children's marriage up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected, and leads these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports about how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time they have made ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in her discussion, acted by women who did not name their husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She has decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that women can easily identify with.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands, a breeder is guilty of which they have maintained all obligations and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman, who does not hold this, is regarded as a deposit, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning of Rohini, who had never called her husband previously on behalf of name, try out at home as it is running."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was finished.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I solvent him from now on with his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">"with this confidence in the luggage, Rohini launched its first discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some felt it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to bring the discussion with an exercise in motion.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then they asked all," If we cannot say the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, means that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equal? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Pais from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra on the breaking of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women allowed the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise, a woman decided to kicked off just before itself; a different decided to release the whole of her frustration against him and his family by cursed it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was static.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenalin rush on it, having broken with an ancient bread, decided that they would actually attempt at home their husbands in the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they held their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put in the head: his wife could not stop his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another Klubmember decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared her, she got afraid and said that there was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said, I should do it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation arded in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the zinerred point on the forehead, which indicates the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why only women must show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the zinerred Point when he was doing it."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed only and I listened to him to wear.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but I think they are now in a better position to choose, even to wear it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their views and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we will take a trip at every discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"during the last months, they celebrated their own birthday with cakes for the first time in their lives, they danced and spoke about things which they had never thought before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been thinking about some things, such as our identities through our husbands, never so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a discussion round we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn Saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most, this is okay, but some wanted a Salad-Kurta, a wide shirt over a pants; they did not trust."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-election, the morality linked to the Saris and much more, jewelry Rohini their own pair of Kurtas (Upper hemden) into a discussion, so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans, and Rohini is safe to be able to create it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether in the five months since their first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things slowly come into roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have done so far only small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then listened to the name of their former annes world."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, make it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are included."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two remain the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discordb know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like the craving of more freedom of movement or their own clothes-election - at the end of a difficult to navigating river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that not only is limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Justice Minister K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This observation has triggered a debate in blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at the meeting of the international branch of the Chamber of Commerce-Association of the State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they were compared with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">That is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," to rotate the logic "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable land, you can say that we are not going to be a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of a flight to the responsibilities, a mandatory violation."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons given by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', given its, it appeared ininevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defends the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the core issue of the theme, the good old Leier appears from the authoritarian rulers, who pretend to be abandoned, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"during the final week of Shanmugam, the answers to his American guests have been given the response to his American guests regarding our press, our political system really non-response."</seg>

<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam to show his mind because she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it is a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country is part of our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our noble K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear this point, provided that he was paid highly, to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"announcing his comment on the blog he points out regarding the reviews that one should begin to read the whole writing of the conference so that one can better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the inscription.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is rather a" city "as a country," he explained why the election in Singapore would be as unequally important, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He in Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said, Singapore is not a country, he obviously does not meant it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment with Shanmugam, who is the leader of a growing generation, such a polemical statement."</seg>

<seg id="1716">"at least I knew Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - whether I disagree with them or not, but that is another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, Member of the new generation of the leaders of Singapore, I have doubts, and I am not even sure if he really believes that he really believes that he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek Review crates the weaknesses of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "welled a mistake" or was it a Freudian speaker? "</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, to which country go back to the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the cabinet, the statements of Mr Shanmugam are of serious significance."</seg>

<seg id="1729">"I have not told what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This phrase seems to have annoyed many of the fact...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country especially "etc," but that is not entirely correct. "</seg>

<seg id="1745">"on my clarifying position then usually follows the default response:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Eishockey, nature. "many Canadians do not cook any inwardly against anger, if they are held for Americans but don't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know themselves, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians of Americans."</seg>

<seg id="1768">"firstly: when" "nice" "to be said, basically, spit to be - like the good-natured, gentle, but portable figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has an own Canadian double-goers)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada would really be a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border with Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is headed by a 59- olds of Mexikaner, a small woman with a coral-pink glasses and gold-colored earrings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"she is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula, and has grown up there. nevertheless, they know a lot under the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">"this nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitian's, who are on transit."</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no more charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night sleep in simple rooms, with collateral, weighing walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and haitilian migrants are here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, the people come in full-buses and from the upper part of the coast they start to call:" "Mama Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also slept outside on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">It does not want to decline anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital when they are sick, they buy them drugs that they cannot pay, they massaged them with a balsam taken by the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao Family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a joghurstache), with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "yes," "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make normal a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other guardians from Mama Africa." mum Africa is a well-known name on the track, "says Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel the circuit together and that Africans speak on Whatsapp by Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a building workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the soccer world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been guest for months guest at Mama Africa: he sold SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to ticks.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," "Send smiling." we will always stay in touch. "</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. Ramírez tells her guests to send their often text messages when they went away to greet them or to tell her about the course of their journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She declares that her Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa but their guests have led her to prepare chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known, but it is not the only spark of hope for migrants who travel by Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family are included in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar spent the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitian."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleeping on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooker outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests can do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I have crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people can help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after being lived for three years, he was referred to a raid on his office from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he was flying in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for an accommodation and a unknown, a single-caterner, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travellers consult their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgically because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother blowing it in their album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hairdrens that you made a customer in, some photos of her grand children and many travellers more, young and Old."</seg>

<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users, in the case of the case above."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minorities region in the west of China, are compelled to install a Spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on 10 July the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of the City of Urumqi received a mobile mail alert, in which she points the District Goverment, a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" web cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app should prevent the use of terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities should use the app for more than the fight against terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh prefecture, because they had already installed the app, exchanged messages with a private Wechat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app was able to determine the sources and distribution routes of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, books and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is the blocking pornography web pages, from online fraud, Trojan and phishing pages to make users attentive how much time they spend online, and to control their own home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the filters for minors should help the children to develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">A app with these features can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "state players or even hackers could be able to manipulate the home network of a person or steal it from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while recording reports about digital censorship in China mostly concentrate on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often dark for those who live in distant, impaired ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"to limit unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme tenders and surveillance measures as well as routinous Internet deactivations."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"this released on Twitter-based media outlet" images from Mainland China "(above all, on the above-above), the censored messages released in China, showed photos of a Checkpoint, at the policeman the residents inquired inquired about whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian ensure that people use the official Jingwang App.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required that the app will install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a Checkpoint with a device without these software, it could be detained by up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>

<seg id="1984">"images from Mainland China" (including the above-mentioned above), also published a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can lift the passwords requirement of a Windows operating system, and thus acquires unlimited access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang there are computers and mobiles in Xinjiang to electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">"the rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council, to minimize the dissemination of illegal contents."</seg>

<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to get used to it, or to be punished for it, although I had nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">To punishment in all their variety.</seg>
<seg id="2065">Its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He is called the loving "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It begins with a plastic pipe which probably dates from the cloacks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoiced to your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him and you cannot withhold your cry."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry did not fell enough, which is why they had exchanged the pipe by a wire."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigators had worked as a trash collection or whether it belonged to normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had four cables intered in each other to present us the, from their view, great invention of a huge cabels."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"within one hour, three of them changed, while I was still at the line."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and my voice, which is why I listened to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noted the cooling, and found no favor at all, which is why he was next to an electrically invited stand."</seg>
<seg id="2076">Flow flowed down my whole body enough to supply my whole quarter.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-bare body, who was spread out on the ground, was the perfect electric leader."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must have been so around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to lay down again sleeping, let's say that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours went out, which came to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room" .Raus with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of a exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father must become fearful worries."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be silent and walk you, you will be moved."</seg>
<seg id="2087">This was new.</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordanic Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken by Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spends most of his time in the indoors; once he mug him to his canvas, back to his computer, back and back to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what one can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or her with nicotine to discover lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives on the top floor of his family house, which had been among them since 1967; the year, in which Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family had been forced to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years Hdaib is a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and asks their long-proven opinions about gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian people, he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only seen in his hometown Amman relevance, but also in cities that range from Damascus to the whole to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with its 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted in his mind by limits, and it can suffer according to their own statement with people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not open it openly, he wins a particular inclination to the US foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib regards his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, to do something with his identity as a" Palestinian people "- so he himself, even if he was born in Jordan, and so far never was in Palestine."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I do not think about my own living circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a human being, whereas in the waters of the Nescafé in two cups shook. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this period it is intended for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The jordanic law also states that public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a vertically hot Junitag has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the slaughter of the warm coffee and the waths of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you take a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, we avoid it simple to do basic things - as in the public during Ramadan water to drink water in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently the Interior Ministry has said a gig of the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary parliamentarians who support the Islamic State Front - the jordanic branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front kaners Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country violates the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The MP and former press spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert 'was canceled' because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many believe in addition to the commitment of the band in affairs such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that implied the long-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement of Mashrou'Leila the jordanic people as" "progressive supporters of human rights" "who continued to work for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement probably should not simply be a seizant rhetoric, but actually a more and more clearly crystallizing reality reflected in Jordan, which appear clearly in Hdaibs work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards to Leibe by providing his vision of the fate of Arab women who have imagined sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a clearly crushed woman, whose arms and legs stretch down to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the last years Jordan has increased the number of "Honorary morde '- the inofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, Human Rights Watch achieved its climax in 2016; however, that Jordan is still lacking its institutional infrastructure to assist women who tried victims of morality or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on the fight against crime from the year 1954 women, women, who are exposed to the danger of civil violence, may be detained for some years in prison, and for their release is often a long time of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee from the family is necessary that the woman has nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity, and is well known for being disshy away from issues that are long as tablou in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, is that he is his music, the full explicit assaults on sexuality, freedom and speech is not able to separate from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I became a policy of politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question of the Palestinian identity in the attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Laval 3aib" "and in" Ghareeb "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are in the core political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song titled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and every other one is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can get in his words," what you want "- be it faith or non-faith, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks in Jordan on the rights of gay and reading and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + -individuals still were strongly censored in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular jordanic OnlineProgramme Roya, to later remember that his comments were torn down from the context, and had been censored by his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but it was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today Hdaib is gaining open to the Arab LGBTQ + community, and represents the opinion that intolerance to homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentioned Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still remained in mind thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks themselves: if Abu Nuwhat, who later work on behalf of the Caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila, or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government attacks against freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the jordanic news service received several former government ministers and members of the curriculum, with the reason they would have expressed critical about the problems with the deep in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"given the concert of Hdaibs, according to the point of view, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to make a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has drilled Mashrou'Leila for the second time as a result, but the path of progress - it looks slow, printed and innermost changes. it is certain that these changes will take place from day to day at the heart of the jordanic society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs, also of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only of being able to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will unite with music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams, and artificial kind of guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is so far, Hdaib will continue to zap and therefore also resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"this report was made by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting, which belongs to Aman as a student Fellow."</seg>

<seg id="2152">"you suspect that there is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas Tohokus. another theory states that the solids are marched into the northeast of more than one thousand years, in order to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to force the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the article" "Liebesmessage to guerrilla fighters," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we write only love notes to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who want to give up their affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is exactly the question of the two young Colombian activists of the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios from the Foundation Bogota and Cristian Palacios, from the Young Youth Youth Foundation (letter to reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write letters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was a place of historical event, and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary armed forces in Colombia), which constitutes the longest-point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"international was considered to be the signatories of the peace treaty, as significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received for his merits for the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"the Colombian is still a long way, until one can speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who have lived for many years in illegal camps, were subjected to war rhetoric, and around the clock contributed their arms to themselves, must now be integrated into the life of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, which had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases deeper hatred towards guerrilla fighters, it must now take into its ranks and support them when building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that young Colombian and in the integration process would have to help.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love message to former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The goal of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla warfare - which should then be delivered personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters of reconciliation was made on the world summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which was held in February 2017 in Bogotá. there, Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to speak brief with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people whom we love, on Valentine's Day, thousands of love letters, but those who need them much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent commitment."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters of hope and support for former fighter of the FARC, which now finds its place in society and have to build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a war story to a common history of peace. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never imagined that someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono region in the region of Caldono-Cauca.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo by the Foundation of Bogota, to transfer the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC presented themselves as they had done earlier to take the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters of undermines of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "" told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an assistant of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca, described this unforgettable experience: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we passed the letters, a former fighter brought me by the camp of guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw into one of the" Cambuck "(a kind of cottage, in which the guerrilla fighters live) in which I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to lay down, because next to him on the bed was a mGL pomegranates, a deadly weapon in the thorn."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"I said to him anyway and asked:" hello, what do they do? "" he answered, "" I answer a letter that someone has written me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote something so beautiful, so I answered it. and suddenly the tears went over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I embraced him very firm and set me next to the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was pity, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters, and wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC, the only way to preserve him and his six brothers from hunger pantod was the only way to forgive him and his six brothers in front of hunger."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know that there is a society outside there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">So far I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start, students and some leaders of the FARC came together to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all raised up as war and the FARC already recorded in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" many years have seen how social injustice we have seen on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in that country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a goal of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who have never found hearing today and had no voting right, and to recognize that men that I often have seen as monsters, and even hate, even people with lovely feelings have been reversed for me, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, does hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">But it comforted me that all people - also those who have killed and so much damage caused us to bring us a little and a smile and a hug.</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The columbians was repellent that after the draining peace would prevail.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it gives inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise to the weapons and to protest up for their rights. and this is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - regardless of which race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, contribute to our contribution and bring victims, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence, will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his brushing door, I got it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a kaulics name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he is respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, foreigners, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the requested, to send me back to Chechnya to prove that all that was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they had absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by moving above without the roads and I say that I had not changed my sex in Grosny, that everything was bad, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have basing size C - what could I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family attempt to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people once said my mother on the road.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," They have brought a monster to the world that has not only damaged your family, but the entire Republic. "</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">My mother became too much and she placed a strife around the neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved to an apartment already a few hours later under the window a car with blackout windows and a Numeric shield with a 95 rate.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after the third time it happened, I realized that something was lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human right-friends enquired the Numeric signs - it turned out that I was tracked.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how have you been flying?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought her without having to register without notice, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I crumbled my old SIM card and cast it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came to the hotel and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you do not think about you, just because you have left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you steckst. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was indeed my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: do you stand in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about the gender equality. however, this is a tablet issue."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I am still wearing some traditional kaulics elements still in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I also wish, this souless barrier can I not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I say always, that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me trouble like the person to see from her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what are your friends, those who have remained the dorsal?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I have submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for me, I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who had the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan no man was arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not enter a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end demand proof that the so-called" honour "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are also now being decoded to men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there was not so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives, or those from their relatives were dropped to face Kadyrows Court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there to be present later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be converted, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they would have attacked either village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply vanished, but submerged to radicalise itself."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this now just a mutation or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone over the one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has since been nothing new to them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They have taken them simply.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was self-evident than these people were taken into account."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports so far. however, we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people, which belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already occurred in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I had my hair ever long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already known all over Grosny, when I lived there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the grave!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, then it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil society", "ultimately, however, took us back to the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Scharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were confisoned; I had colored eyelashes, bore tube-jeans and short tail. "</seg>
<seg id="2354">The safety of the sharia has never been harmed to me only one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been belated.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda, that is," Spotte not over the evil of another. "</seg>
<seg id="2359">One often says it to children if people are funny about crane.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just have their eyes closed to you because they believed, they were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">They never sinned, never hunted and never beaten. "</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace stopped?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morality."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us, but above the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had smiled and laughed before, viewed you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I was able to feel how the situation in the Republic has steadily increased."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what kind of activity do you proceed?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't deserved a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the US is not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, assembling, I comprehite it to the hospital and help them to get essays."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I have no cents for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves as I clave a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is allocalities.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature, it is purely nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to show you with foam in front of the mouth that there are no tails."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestanis who have the cabiners who have the Russians, also which; on the entire planet there are they - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant to hear what to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet here as many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live with men together.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about Transidentity of men who love men, and they believe that you can change his sex in order to make more intimate experiences. but that's a truction."</seg>
<seg id="2390">These are two different things - two different kinds of sensation in order to accurately be different life settings.</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not ashamed for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry that I become so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now already longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am now myself.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I am not identifiable with feminism, nor with the intersectional struggle"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">"the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ayomide Zuri, originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions where many different positions were expressed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminists, many women react - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well through scientific and social arguments against me why I should be feminist and why in general all feminists should be * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today still earn less money despite equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"women are still under strict observation, when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms always ensure that women come across a gloss cover earlier or later in various fields of life, and that discrimination is still drawn through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is well known and known.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced and I will be twice and triple.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, if I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black CIS women, on black women, on black women, on black women, on black women, women, and verbal abuse have been abused, both in and outside of feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women - should come together to uplift their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my lord' to sing the equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence is an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we are exposed to black women at two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">"in fact, black women and women from other ethnicities and countries of origin earn less than white men and women."</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with migrant background are exposed to a higher risk, domestic violence and violence are exposed to the partnership as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all the men, and at all men, any skin color, who have the same rights; on the other hand I can consider myself as a black woman, in whose center the white woman stands to take into account injustices in their thinking, which relate to the gender as well as to the skin colour of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere that has rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Soap complained in his speech:" "I am not a woman?" "and I also refused to maintain an ideology, in which the black woman is a dehumanized and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I deviate myself to join the groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, to drive their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to seize white women the importance of overcutting of skin color and sex. for some of them will continue to keep the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to honor them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional feminism was founded in order to give women of different income a home and to deny yourself from the white feminism, is still the word" feminism "in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself fully from feminism and join me to the movement of Womanism, which is called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of being stubborn to a white-feminist paradigm, that is so stubborn that intersectional phenomenon is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and set us into the spheres, which will be created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clan Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana ha: Reclaiming (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: how we can defend ourselves, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, spiritual, physical and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists will immediately call separatism and exclusion after they read these lines, I ask you to inform about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment I can uplift black women and women from other cultures, as in this paradigm I am existent."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm due to my dark skin and because of my existence as a part of this paradigm.</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay." the article belongs to the series # PorSerMujer (# Christmas-women's) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most of the names were changed to protect the persons concerned.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commander said Ada Báez, that she was nothing against Luis Balbuena, her expartner who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship has passed a little time and the police said, her statement would be put to the files, but more could not do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"as another woman Balbuena showed for abuse, also the acoustic indication of Ada Báez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">A few days later the second woman moved their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">To break the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women at all once advert ad, they generally do not receive support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases women are also dependent on men which they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who have to admit, to be victims of violence, to comply with the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"inhalt1 strokes and Statistical 2 invitations and a legal system that is nothing lower than 3 Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation of strokes and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really misused, says Myrian González, researcher for comrades on the Centro de Documentación y Estudio, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay." there are various indications and reports that do not even accumulate the extent of gender violence against women in Paraguay. "</seg>
<seg id="2491">The numbers available are however alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015 at the District-state office 9600 ads went for domestic violence. at 70% of them, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there have been more than 5000 ads for domestic violence in the peace process. also here, 86% of the ads came from women."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads said 40% of women, that they have become physically middled, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayischen women Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these criminal offences are also actually shown." to any woman who are refunded in Paraguay because of psychic missal display, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"every woman who is refunded due to physical abuse, come two women who do not do this," "she explained at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide in Paraguay is not a private criminal, cannot document the law enforcement authorities as many women killed each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016, journalists were at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country alone."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay all ten days a woman dies due to violence through men."</seg>

<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but then after. this should not regret it forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but two years she carried the mental force on the one hand - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most severe recognizable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never thought that I would have been victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier about it, I always thought that the only women had happened to be subserviced because they can be fooled by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where they described his insults and various attacks during their two-year relationship and told how he had isolated it."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically, if he ever asked the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour has also been a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen the so long from Carlos and left him not before.</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have a certain complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that their former partner smiled it."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"Victoria is a member of the network Yo CREO (" I believe you "), which consists of women who are all victims of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner managed eventually even to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias advertisements in the authorities stayed without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>

<seg id="2525">Paraguay laws: good approach, lack of implementation "</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but are not applied."</seg>

<seg id="2531">"the original design of the law foresees to explain to a peculiar criminal offences, and to punish tougher as it is already in the neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia."</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus the legislative text was altered in some points in order to also win the MPs for the Law, who feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions is generally prohibited, which is generally prohibited in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill introduced most of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedures that must carry the victims of violence at present, if they just want to reimburse an ad and receive a secure accommodation to abandon the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">"Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds to do so:"</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay it is seen as a part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a change must take place, so that violence will no longer be regarded as a slightly Normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"those who are silent in the face of these facts, makes itself guilty and helps to run away the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2538">"we must refund such a long indication, until the abuse is no longer considered normal."</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the law in the paraguayan Senate has been adopted. previously, parts of the law were changed however, and among other things, a passage was repainted, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation."</seg>

<seg id="2589">"for the need for local medical research there are two reasons: for a lack in the range of global healthcare, lots of medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious consequences in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky originally appeared on the website Ensia.com, a magazine, which reported about solution possibilities for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been chaired in the USA for the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredder, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA Astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years Morton's work was done only by its own ingenuity, and the question how many salutors can get, borders."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s he noted that more salads were patented, and that he was not able to use them for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for single varieties, but also for certain characteristics as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or curved leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been signed on more plants such as cereals or cartel varieties. due to these trends, plant breeding, environmentalist and expert food safety provide food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton is still salad, but it's no longer necessary since his work is getting more and more challenging due to increasing constraints."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, when in a river there would be a rock brow, around which I must buddy."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they withstand at court, no one can breed any more new salads because all the characteristics are already patented. so he is doing so well as possible and tries to churn the characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and tries to use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He has also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and everywhere in the world: open source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space station ISS have bred red Römersalat of the variety Outredder in the "greenhouse" of the station bred and eaten. there will be tested whether plants grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds more like that, than the movement from the IT field, and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for" Open Source "-seed) can be inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyright protected software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was launched in life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property, thus permanently usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeders have to commit to that others can use the seeds freely from them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with its seeds and sell it." open source "breeders only permit others to breed their seeds, to breed, and to pick it out immediately - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seeds and the opportunity to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, seeds will play a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to use the latter or only use little by raising seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "Open Source" movement is not busy with genetically modified crops.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "who wants to buy good, locally and sustainable producing vegetables, which is offered in August or September 2016, should also know that the way it is bred on farms, such as this vegetable is bred."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereign without seed, is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative pledge to make others their seeds freely available. thus, their approach is in contrast to the seeds, seeds and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo of Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supplies is jeopardized because the available gene pool due to the increasing wealth of intellectual property law on plant material, which is therefore always limited, incessant."</seg>
<seg id="2658">Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her PhD's work with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about one third of all cartels features as intellectual property is protected either at all or not only difficult. "</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massaged plants like wheat in a large scale are patented as a salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred so bred that they have targeted characteristics - from such, through which their taste or color improves up to such, due to which they flourish in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing due to more and more patents. genetic variety is currently more necessary than ever before, since the changed conditions are far worse from climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail Monsanto speaker in Carly Scaduto, that genetic variety is generally important and also crucial for monsantos activities. with a total of four comrades and the cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to preserving the genetic variety."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property other breeders is restricting, since" patents and the protection of plant varieders promote innovation. "" a patent is basically taken up a plan that anyone can follow, as soon as the patent is up. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions can help others with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes them by being made available to the public more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait, until a patent flow, it is certainly not a innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you need to wait for so long to be able to breed plants that are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, the struggle would have been lost."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is however, that genetic resources were always a general public and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monest incentives have not been attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it will make us impossible if we continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton interferes on the concept to document plant characteristics:" "we do not create the characteristics really ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants they form themselves and as breeders we ultimately have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the U.S. state Oregon and Ossi Board, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" "who is a variety, he also produces his own values into them."</seg>
<seg id="2676">Those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monokultures needed for growing Herbicide that are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture.</seg>
<seg id="2677">"my concept is accurate." ""</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Z. B. Monsanto are) patents have to survive, either they refuse the patent or they keep it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both are the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent seed company Frank Morton is looking for in its breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton also believes that breeders would be innovative in the prevention of plant patently," It looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need constantly new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years ago," he says. "with a patent for 20 years in front of competition, what makes it pretty easy for my opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the United States seem to be a leader in the" "Open Source" "breeding, the concept is now spreading quickly around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Center for Sustainable Agriculture (Centre for Sustainable Agriculture"), which describes itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, a "open source" seed program, working together with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements. "</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come in" open source "seed, and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Association Agrecol is working on an" open source "license, which ultimately is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi duty for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for breeder vary from country to country, present for the Ossi duty, not just one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, explains that conventionally bred plants not patentable to be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"yet an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the member states of the Member States, to implement the patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch Organization of Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on the farmers, operator of seed banks and seed companies from all Eastern Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' Program of 'Open Source' seed systems, that the organization currently announces a global alliance for" Open Source "seed systems, for the planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international nonprofit development organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database for seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, launched a report from aid agencies such as WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - a report published, it represents the possibility that farmers will have the opportunity to collaborate and ensure a stable supply of food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report also emphasizes the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection from the Luby of Ossi hopes that it will soon recognize more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food is especially respected where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a part, so Luby." we now try to make people clear that there are even more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered to be the first censored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities block the independent news page MADA Masr, Arab-language edition of the Huffington Post, and the emerging network of Al Jazeera because of alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video like the police violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles are mainly about politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">In a Facebook comment Ziada voiced to the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to block is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfatah al-Sisi. and even if the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, then it is for two reasons for me:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It has been able to give me the feeling of an inscription: a arrest, a tried murder, discharge on the national Security Council, the blocking blogs as well as any other web page for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proved that I wrote not in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even if only on a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to deal with the censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The mute go the way up to the end.</seg>

<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in its research:</seg>

<seg id="2746">"such practices refer to the intention of the government to block content, to block content, to access the Egyptian users."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally worsen that the censored decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis for the Egyptian people to proceed against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers report all over Brazil with a whisper headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcards."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Each second day will be murdered a police officer in Rio de Janeiro," "Diebe rushed pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Marine and Air Force to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violence in Rio reached the highest status for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian government Global Justice even called for the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports as these are all daily and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"thus published for the detailed reporting of violence in Rio well-known newspaper" "Extra" "on 16 August the editorial" "This is not normal", "in which she announced to set up a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world like murder, robbery, sex break, etc. all, which happens from the civilized standard and what only happened in Rio, is going to call in the heading" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">"this is the only alternative, so that we as journalists do not close our eyes before the cruelty."</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video that was shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, the editor-in-chief stated that this decision is no occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that doesn't realize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper explains that it is according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 areas which are controlled by criminal organizations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">In the editorial the newspaper writes on:</seg>

<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose objective is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" be more than they uset?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist was argued in Cecília Oliveira, against the violence as a" war. "this is in their opinion a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it difficult to hold responsibility in the police."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as demonstrated in the analysis of military deployments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and self-reliance of public service."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. for some years, the UPP should actually protect the UPP and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit, increasingly under accusation."</seg>
