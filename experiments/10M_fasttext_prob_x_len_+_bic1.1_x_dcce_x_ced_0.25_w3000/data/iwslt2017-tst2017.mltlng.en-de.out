this is James R@@ isen .
you might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegal phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence cooperation in which the CIA placed literally cutting for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if the crazy sounds , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not eat the chapter at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government against R@@ isen has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol for the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and re@@ ap journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional Treaty , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the mu@@ te they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government joined R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused , and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , it happened something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they were given for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , the re@@ porter and springs can hide more and less . &quot;
&quot; instead of failing and income to the statements , they could also do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phone call is secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , financial and banking information , its credit @-@ purpose , and even travel @-@ wise with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that used them to judge Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and ris@@ ens &apos;s source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all the US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government gets too much of their work as secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; thus , we put the press work protected by the first constitutional record , because the government has more possibilities to pick out all of them . &quot;
&quot; but just as the technology of the government allows the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they can take the right from the moment in which they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect , in witness . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that there was not yet , when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much more secure than normal e @-@ mails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source system for wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers which was originally developed from the Internet famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; if you want to send an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload and send documents , as with any usual contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the relevant news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government does not proc@@ ure more information secretly , and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately governments around the world are developing new sp@@ y @-@ based technologies , which are all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed us . &quot;
&quot; it is time to ensure that not only technology tor@@ ch such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to bring mis@@ set@@ ters . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
&quot; the information about abnorm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers knows and will report from crowded hospitals . or the next environmental colleague , the alarm strikes the contaminated water of F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street in@@ sider , which warned us prior to the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on 3 April 2016 , the largest data collection of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; contained that Rei@@ che and mo@@ aning &#93; have hidden in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we b@@ ate Robert Pal@@ mer of Global W@@ aves were hidden in Panama . &#93; This week we have been based on news about a L@@ eck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to the very first very direct consequences .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad stamp @-@ Assad in tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cell@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release , and waiting for the next un@@ veiled documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the P@@ lot of an agency @-@ editor or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems that wine is from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we address what ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global whales , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax hav@@ ens will be used by a few of them to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people appearing this whole world very confusing , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens function . &quot;
I always imagine it like an Mat@@ r@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ ara .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , in another company what makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as to journalists or civil society really understand what matters .
I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US .
&quot; probably , because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; but by principle , after which these tax hav@@ ens function , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some U.S. states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a libr@@ arian . &quot;
this kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to aver@@ t school children .
it has been allowed to aver@@ t especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that concerns us all .
here at Global W@@ ard we wanted to find out how all this is in practice .
how does that work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
&quot; we really shocked that all of us made a lawyer of our investig@@ ators , how he could transfer his money . &quot;
&quot; these were all happ@@ enings . none of these lawyers accepted us as clients , and of course no one was handed over to anyone else . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
&quot; it is not about a single lawyer , who has put forward @-@ down proposals . &quot;
&quot; it is not about a single leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to face this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change rules in order to make this kind of behavior difficult .
&quot; this may sound very disturbing , as if we could do anything about it ; as if nothing had ever changed , as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
but when born optim@@ ist I don &apos;t see that a lot has begun to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have seen the impulses to greater transparency on what the owners of companies are concerned . &quot;
the topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU captured in central reg@@ isters at national level , who really is behind firms in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US deposited here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global whales this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people , which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind them . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , who stand up and say : &quot; &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians , who recognize the problem and campa@@ igning to end this kind of transparency through laws . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finish the in@@ transparency which now allows this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was ab@@ duc@@ ted almost once and in the trunk of a red ma@@ yer . &quot;
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sales . &quot;
a guy stayed in the red ma@@ da and looked at my belon@@ gings .
he bought one of my artwork .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip all the country . after that he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep then ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
&quot; what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I now have to offer a sleeping place ?
&quot; but I just got to know him . he says , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning this . I don &apos;t ab@@ duc@@ ts the trunk of a ma@@ z@@ ap ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
&quot; then I heard me say , &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my mind said : &quot; &quot; h , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the blan@@ ket and thought , &quot; Oh dear ! what I put in my room ? &quot;
a wild mil@@ der sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , on the ti@@ p@@ inn@@ y to the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in contact .
the artwork that he had bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
&quot; maybe the people , who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; to accommodate people on my air mattress , it was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress with you . &quot;
&quot; let us take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ite , my room@@ mate attracts , and the rent will be increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe creativity can create it , to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I survived like we could make something about it . our apartment will stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , including a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood @-@ floors .
they found it super and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham &apos;s che@@ ek tasted completely different , because we did it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all over the city . when we have passed our last guest and fell to the castle , star@@ ting Brian and me . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on the people public pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
they can then invite them to other foreign people to stay overnight in them .
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
but they do not act .
&quot; no one who is still very con@@ sol@@ ation , would invest in a shop who allowed foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we as children all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you have a look at the things you can do . we could design . &quot;
&quot; at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and ap@@ athy -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we learned how to make objects designed , but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who have never met before . &quot;
can design be able to do something ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a ta@@ sters , which degree of trust we owe . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your com@@ for@@ tz@@ one .
thum@@ b high if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
give your ent@@ less mobile phone to your left seat .
&quot; this quietly stop of panic , which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , your home is home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the wi@@ ped cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most are felt the responsibility .
&quot; so , most of the guests feel when they are staying elsewhere . &quot;
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just that , who has now Al Gor@@ es Handy ? &quot;
could you pro@@ claim to Twitter for the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones to now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail about this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor would have imagined once again with his name , if he tells , wh@@ ence he comes , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 respondents , all say , &quot; &quot; he can really stick very well against mobile phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a good feedback system strengthens confidence .
at the beginning we did some things wrong .
&quot; it was hard for the people , to give negative assessments . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed their opinions before we made them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we have conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are at the age and residence . &quot;
little surprise we trust the people most who like us at the most like .
the more differences we find the less we trust .
this is a natural social pre@@ disposition .
&quot; it is exciting , when you add the call of a person -- in our case by terms of view . &quot;
&quot; if one has less than three terms , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation holds common com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; moreover , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are left . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how to &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; tell me much , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal level of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I do with my family holiday . &quot;
how can I create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
&quot; our whole company builds on hoping that the right design can help , to overcome our prejudices against strangers . &quot;
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
you can see three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the tirel@@ ess work of our team .
&quot; third , a demand that had not been covered before . &quot;
the business works very well for us .
&quot; of course , there are also times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed parties to be celebrated or ap@@ ed apartments .
hosts have been able to leave guests in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came straight to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the front line , when confidence has been broken . &quot;
there is nothing scar@@ f than these phone calls . it does hurt when I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the call@@ ers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , from the 123 million saved nights only a fraction ever had a problem . &quot;
because people are familiar with each other .
&quot; if trust works , it can arise . &quot;
&quot; one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there , he suffered a heart attack . &quot;
his host took him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
&quot; perfect house for travelers , who tend to go to heart attack due to sitting activities . &quot;
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ru@@ gel who can save life , even though they don &apos;t know anything . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car into the hospital when you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to be lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
&quot; you can even stay longer , without charge the extra nights . &quot;
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so of course not every stay is running .
but these relations behind pure money @-@ action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; for the first time I stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing with money transactions together ?
this is an economic trade .
&quot; but it is now just to call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing is not justified . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
people lay a part of themselves open and that is changing everything .
&quot; if you travel today , this is to compare with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but not auth@@ en@@ tically auth@@ en@@ tically . &quot;
but what would be if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions would be ?
&quot; what would be if at any place you have visited , a group there Ans@@ äs@@ si@@ ger would wait to fill a thorough and show one on a Knei@@ p@@ our district , one of which has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would design apartments from the ground to the toge@@ thers ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would take the thoughts of the common part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces , which belonged to the government . &quot;
&quot; now , residents are offered . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
were given to people whose children were pulled out . there were incub@@ ator programs .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreig@@ ner or even host . &quot;
the idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hosp@@ it@@ ability there were even before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why has our work done ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we indicated that you can find the right design with the components of the trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome profound prejudices .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
down@@ right overwhelming .
I don &apos;t have to think about when a red ma@@ da goes past me .
we naturally know that design cannot solve any problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we could use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think when you see me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or sup@@ pressed , brain @-@ la@@ undering , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay at the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I will not blame you for your negative impressions .
&quot; so , the media are people who look like me . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak to their u@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslims : it is great , you will know . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- dou@@ bling es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted
a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ ase @-@ Fitness fan@@ atics in Germany
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have decided on this .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ ting me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as homo@@ sexual human , as some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ ine . I decided to wear the hi@@ j@@ ab , my head coverage . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you sup@@ pressed yourself ?
&quot; the trial was : at that time , it was a feminist independence , namely against the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , made me a perfect and un@@ at@@ tainable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have discussed with the Quran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked , doub@@ ted , and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was confidence and slow dedication which deep@@ ened up with every reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to wines .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and lived basically the &quot; Egyptian American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had an early breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ ding &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ planes flew in buildings , people spl@@ itting from the buildings . &quot;
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned quickly in rebellion .
why should one do something like that ?
&quot; I moved the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam , ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it is not only my country being attacked , but in the n@@ u reconc@@ iling me the actions of others from a civil war into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
the same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go into a new city and start with the start of the start .
&quot; I remember how I went in silence -- so deep it went to my seat , and I feared the first time as Mus@@ lim@@ ine to be recognized . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in our apartment , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said , &quot; &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Sei@@ d gently &quot; , &quot; &quot; St@@ aying in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Ver@@ sam@@ mm@@ ed you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week in@@ doors .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting of reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who held responsible for Muslims in the free war . &quot;
there was really br@@ aces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something felt not right .
because people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I survived the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to have to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing to ask questions , I love questions . &quot;
they are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
today we can actually hear people say : &quot; there is a problem in that country -- it is called Muslims .
when will we go wrong ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my community like a tumor in the USA .
it only poses the question : are we mali@@ cious or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a mal@@ ignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor just under observation .
the alternatives are poin@@ t@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are like all the other Americans , no tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers - First and Olympi@@ oni@@ ans .
will the closure of mos@@ ques America safer ?
&quot; there may be perhaps a few parking free , but do not stop terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant , and greater citizens &apos; participation . &quot;
&quot; and like a leader of the police in the Washington , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; the radic@@ alization process is determined that he begins online . as a result the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extrem@@ ist group can make a brain @-@ la@@ undering which causes terrorists to be the true Muslims , and anyone who h@@ ears their behavior and ideology is a betra@@ yal or from faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radicals , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Quran . &quot;
&quot; as Mus@@ lim@@ ine , as mother , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
&quot; but we would add to their imagination , if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers . &quot;
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u club Kl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; both groups claim their ideology reasons in their &quot; &quot; Holy Book &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but if one thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not driving them what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m told me recently an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she imagined to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every spiritual , with whom she had spoken , she brought to silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger sense , it was a main target for the instrument@@ alization by extremis@@ ts that promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ use them for their anger , he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , it did before that to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as the Islam@@ ophobia come to me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day , on our thoughts of thought ? &quot;
one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear that at least three things happen .
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian government system , conformity and prejudices . &quot;
&quot; a study reveals : if you report a test , in which negative about Muslims , they also have more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academ@@ ical problem .
if you look when the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 - it happened three times but never happened in connection with terrorist attacks .
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Mos@@ lem terror as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to compens@@ ate the foundation of a free society , which has rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early sign .
&quot; we may sense it as first , but the toxic air of fear leaves us all . &quot;
in the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism it is not just about having to explain itself .
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ men .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , promising , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the sweet@@ est , generous person , whom she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when is such a wasted young man turned out ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne at her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she was murdered , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , which was visiting the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as with a execution , after he posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he sho@@ vel eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
have we gone to the mosque or we were safe at home ?
&quot; we possessed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we decided on the mosque .
&quot; with our son at the seat of the child , we drove welding , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , moved my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw , caused me to stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked him and was welcomed to our guests , because half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who came to us , but to join us . &quot;
at this moment I am collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure to go to number ?
or will you join those that mean : we are better than that .
many thanks .
thanks lovely !
&quot; Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have taken a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who perhaps claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ker@@ in with deep access , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say dec@@ eive you . I am completely normal .
I am not an exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is permitted .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest ever accomplished study to Moslems around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : many thanks . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler , is about to be a billi@@ on@@ aire shop . &quot;
&quot; monitoring , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . they are made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air package entry into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of air machinery in the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks . a few years ago , they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by inter@@ locking the tools , high speed and acceleration in the narro@@ west space . &quot;
you can also build autonom@@ ously load@@ able structures .
they have learned to bear loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to exceed the limits of the Pos@@ sible flight .
&quot; thus a system aut@@ on@@ om works , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at the ET@@ H Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an integral part of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available on the highest image . for example , &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter .
a leaf@@ let that tries to beat two flies with a cap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in advance @-@ moving , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float outside , and has a large number of advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
however there is always a downside .
a restriction of h@@ eck@@ ers is that they are sensitive to turmoil like wind bows .
we develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air device doesn &apos;t matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often provide basic abstract issues that lead to the core of the matter .
such a question would be : what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known about as machinery with a thousand movable parts that work together to inj@@ ure you .
&quot; two decades ago , trained pilots managed to fly remot@@ ely controlled air devices , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ ru@@ der . &quot;
long ago we discovered that flying with only one works .
this is the mon@@ osp@@ inner that mechan@@ ically easiest and served air@@ planes . it was invented recently .
&quot; it has only a movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no cl@@ apping , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ pul@@ ls , no further pitches or controls , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , in the inner life very much , so that it can fly stable and moving in space . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the cus@@ hion . to bring it to flying , I need to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the probability , it &apos;s right to throw when I all watch , is low , therefore I show you a video that filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; if the moon is an exercise in weakness , this machine is here , the om@@ kop@@ ter with his eight prop@@ ell@@ ans , one exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this over@@ flow ?
they see that it is only symm@@ et@@ rical .
therefore he is ambi@@ valent in his alignment .
&quot; by doing so , he receives the remaining capacity , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is rot@@ ated or even as he rot@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight fo@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest will learn directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see it in .
&quot; when flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliably . &quot;
this machine is made up of two separate two @-@ prop@@ ellers machines .
this turns in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate that by doing half a plane .
the last demonstration is investig@@ ating synthetic s@@ warming .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took negoti@@ able micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one sli@@ ce of bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think new revolutionary ideas .
the especially secure machine here on Broadway would like to be a flying lamp at Broadway .
of course it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology .
&quot; for types like us , the salary is in the development and the creation act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a memory , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that creative , clever creatures are allowed to form them in such a spectacular manner . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago , cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy two black holes are getting faster , they turned the mass of thre@@ es in a tenth of ti@@ dings in pure energy . &quot;
for this short moment it lit more bri@@ ghter than all stars along with all galax@@ ies of the whole known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; however , it does not put on her energy in the form of light -- &quot;
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was given into space @-@ time fabric and the universe is explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
let us arrange the events at first time .
thirteen billion years ago had just emerged on Earth .
&quot; since then the earth brought a lot out : cor@@ als , fish , plants , sau@@ rier , people and -- God stand up to us - even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech - to build a giant laser det@@ ector to search for Gravit@@ on@@ waves that arise from col@@ li@@ ous black holes . &quot;
most they held them for crazy .
but enough people realized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ rot@@ ary observatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of LIG@@ O could be increased significantly , which increase the performance output enormously improved . &quot;
that is why we now call it Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; in early September 2015 , LIG@@ O was launched for a recent test run to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two collap@@ sed black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell of my death @-@ sick father .
basically these were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that I had worked for , is no longer Science F@@ ic@@ tion ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ist in the MIT . he studied for 23 years of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ codi@@ fication in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and are stretched into the other . &quot;
&quot; to illustrate faculty , teachers in courses for rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ al dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves are extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each one of us was stretched out during the meeting of the waves and dri@@ lled . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average person was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; this means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one explained the LIG@@ O staff for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and this is already absurd , this length would be reduced to less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of an atomic wall . that is most grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gravity .
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ H@@ as , the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are tremendous . &quot;
&quot; but physic@@ ists are fin@@ e@@ ful , and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
Thor@@ ne was published in 1973 and 42 years before its success .
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more than an eye than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your mobile . &quot;
this is quite handy . because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you by several points .
in sounds the other is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will make you particularly much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead , we listen after certain properties such as clay and height , rhythm and volume , to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks to Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob under@@ breaks them . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by careful about changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least there are for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble area .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns in mol@@ all , we can literally talk the whole . &quot;
&quot; the gravity for lau@@ ghing , can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , not revol@@ ving holes , cir@@ cus simple : bet ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same pine@@ apple with an additional key change . this sounds like Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a type of movement , shapes in the wav@@ el@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date , which at least I never forget -- heard LIG@@ O Fol@@ ders , who knows what he has to hear , see this as the noise of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with the 30 @-@ f@@ acher solar mass , which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 son@@ es , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ es , revol@@ ve each one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we heard it .
there is the constant importance of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O p@@ aves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
on this way we can listen to the all and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why the stars in super @-@ nov@@ ae would explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about this .
&quot; the exciting physical processes are happening in the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never be seen since these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it would be transparent glass . the jungle would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them , since the jungle is shining through his own light @-@ shine . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible , to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of whom we have no idea of what we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact LIG@@ O found the same in the very first attempt , which we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars , the black holes produce , as LIG@@ O they observed are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , age @-@ old bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the le@@ av@@ ed bones for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O allows us to have an entirely different angle of view of the events , in all , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists of being as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the jungle ?
now is the time of big dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year long I would say to everything &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; in front of which I feared . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , me in unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV live ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to start playing with the game ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a mad thing happened : exactly what I feared , I was afraid of removing my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , talking about , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of one word is impressive .
&quot; &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; has changed my life . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes , which changed my life , on an un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; estim@@ ating &quot; &quot;
as if they were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ able , I need milk for my beak . &quot;
&quot; she once asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this one was the beginning
&quot; a new setting in my family . from there I swe@@ ar to play with them as soon as you claim me . no matter what I do , or where I go , I will always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
almost . I am not perfect but I am trying .
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has a striking side @-@ effect : only recently , I understood completely , that the &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am author , I think of things , go out for life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I am talking television . I Produc@@ ers TV .
&quot; I make TV , in large style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world .
four television programs for 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production .
&quot; each shipment offers hundreds of jobs , which previously didn &apos;t exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV@@ s , 70 hours TV , three shows , 3 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series are running on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours broad@@ casts that I have created myself , and not only produced , so still ob@@ end@@ lessly . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire , all around the world . &quot;
do you know who that is still doing ?
&quot; nobody , that &apos;s why I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I would not like to impress you with them .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you , so that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company , a country or a classroom , so you understand that I &apos;m not just hanging around a computer and imagin@@ ative , and it is true when I say , I understand that it is not a dre@@ am@@ job for dre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything reality , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m working a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
when I get absorbed into the work there is no other feeling .
my work always creates a country from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set the troops up , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; for example , you stand a high tone , lying a marathon . &quot;
one feels like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and maternal , cruel and reasonable . and the best thing is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working out well .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sums of it sounds like a busy road , I could always drive on her . &quot;
&quot; a lot of people accept when I declare to them the buzz , that I &apos;m writing writing , that writing my writing . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the buzz -- when I began working with television production , when I began to work and work , build and working , I discovered this matter , this buzz , this energy . &quot;
the sums is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is light and air .
the buzz of God is the voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , you can &apos;t be different from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not to be able to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
perhaps it is called genius .
maybe it means ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I know only that I am not made for failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; to make clear : the more successful I get , the more the more time , the more over@@ s , the more work there are , the more the more things I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations are there . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more you have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I @-@ monkey , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the buzz , the sums , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I only this buzz ?
and then stops the buzz .
&quot; revised , over@@ laid , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the buzz stops .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single worker at the institute .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my mom will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; estim@@ ating , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby @-@ tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums heard . &quot;
the tot@@ aling of the engine was w@@ alled .
I did not love my job anymore . the engine was out .
the buzz did not come back .
my sums was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , re@@ worked weekends , no re@@ ue , nothing del@@ e@@ aves , one Titan sleeps , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV@@ s , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV@@ s , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a show @-@ Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was gray , I simply had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz I was .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; &quot; Heu@@ l you out , blonde of the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you work , you love to be a teacher , a painter , a mother , one loves to know one another , and knows how the sums you know , when you stop the buzz , who is it then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; listening to the song of my heart , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I put my &quot; southern @-@ state wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; to me .
&quot; I am on the way out , late off and she says , &quot; &quot; mom@@ my , do you play ? &quot;
and I will say no more than two things to be aware of :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it does not call anyone more .
when is that happened ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan , and my sums arise , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; mom@@ my , do you play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and run their sisters , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &apos; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &apos; . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the sol@@ itude and in the absence of the immense , I can do nothing but to match . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country , which I @-@ monkey , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists sti@@ cky finger and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ ver @-@ p@@ ens and the song in which it is going to release , or whatever the girl in &quot; The Eis@@ Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I at@@ me .
play is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door walks up and an energy shoes comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happened . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the buzz , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel as if I would know a magical secret .
but let us stay in the matter .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the working environment , the titanium @-@ hum@@ men , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , if I describe myself with the broad@@ casts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz is . &quot;
the buzz is not a force and it is not specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real buzz depends on the love .
the buzz is the stream that comes from my lust .
the real buzz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the complete tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real buzz is simple and original .
&quot; the real buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pering to God the wrong words , for whom God told me that I am an Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
once my child wants to play with me I will say yes .
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free me as a work@@ a@@ holic of any fault . &quot;
it is law ; I have no other choice . I have no other choice unless I want to hear the buzz again .
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I am not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; do not play Cr@@ at@@ bil@@ ise , how we work . &quot;
the truth is hur@@ ts ;
but I don &apos;t like it to play .
I always work because I love it .
I rather am at the workplace as home .
&quot; this entry is painful , because what kind of man works rather than being home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we ras@@ en in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we crus@@ hing soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mainly sti@@ ff , absent , and confused . &quot;
I always wanted to go to my mobile phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why did we ever ceased with the games ?
you can also say it ! do they always tell if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you hold me for na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dreams .
&quot; you will be right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et show .
you can find your child less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my babies want to play with me at most 15 minutes , up to them that they want something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ins or K@@ eks replaces me .
&quot; and I speak my teen@@ ie @-@ daughter whole 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more than it does not require . &quot;
everyone can take 15 minutes on the piece even at a bad @-@ day @-@ day !
at least 15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children were praying . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is true to feel the sums of being a place for peace peace . &quot;
it is not about playing with their own children . it is about joy
around the &quot; Games &quot; in general .
treat yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find it out and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I sc@@ iss@@ ors and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more .
15 minutes a piece of why not full 15 minutes treat ?
what can be false ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return when I do not work .
working is not working without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office . I hear a familiar melody , she meets me and my soul . I use it into new ideas . I use it to full and love my work again . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I need it not .
I am not the buzz of sums it is not me ... not anymore .
soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the buzz of love .
&quot; the buzz of work is part of me , but just a part of it . and I am so grateful for this . &quot;
&quot; it is me that I am a Titan , I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
&quot; yes , I said Yes to less work and more games . &quot;
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires still burn .
&quot; the more I play , the happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clearly my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the land , which I mean , the marathon that I run , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the sums , the buzz , the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , jumping , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think of things , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks lovely .
I am neuro@@ surgical treatment .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , unlike other bodily organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a severe violation of the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical treatment .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; surely , they have heard of one of the most prominent , the &quot; &quot; Low @-@ stag stimulation &quot; . &quot; thereby , one im@@ pl@@ ates an electro@@ de depth in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons of neur@@ ons so that neurological functions are improved . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Par@@ kinson who suffered under fierce tre@@ mb@@ ling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation means not Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream Func@@ tional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
the story began 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading lie@@ der and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I have patients with sk@@ ul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that at skull @-@ Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ mas the brain irrit@@ ated and the cran@@ ial @-@ pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , one has to dimin@@ ish the skull of the skull . &quot;
that &apos;s why one sometimes has to remove a part s@@ wollen brain .
&quot; instead of throwing the sli@@ pped brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist , the brain . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from that tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; cells from one tissue , grow to grow , is comparable to very small children who will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the proper diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
this is what we had to do with these cells .
after many trials it managed Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his micro@@ scope .
it was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with big green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
maybe you still know from the Bi@@ ologi@@ e@@ Learning Spanish that stem cells are un@@ mature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells stopped differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but was different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long to understand , where they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
you make up 4 % of our large @-@ stag cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the folding of the brain .
but why are they staying ?
we do not know .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells .
&quot; we are facing a potential cell source , which allows brain healing . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean @-@ François
and they subsequently mark coloured to be able to follow them in the brain .
in the last step we appl@@ au@@ ded it at the earliest of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist transp@@ l@@ ant -- auto@@ bahn planning .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we promote these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we are pl@@ ot@@ ting the same cells in the dig@@ ging brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller we could work with monkeys .
&quot; in the first scenario we pl@@ ot@@ ted the cells into a healthy brain , and we watched that after a few weeks they had completely disappeared , they go back home . the room is already occupied , so they will not disappear there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we feed an injury and pe@@ an@@ ed exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been refined .
&quot; the evidence they show are these small points . these are the cells that we used in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
here we could not stop .
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
&quot; so , we have monkeys with a manual de@@ skill task . &quot;
you had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
they made them very well .
&quot; when they achieved a stable skill level , we injured the hand@@ mot@@ oric range in the mot@@ oric cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to people , they spontaneously recovered to some degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ zed , and then they try to recover with the help of sculp@@ tural bra@@ isms . they are a certain degree , as well as the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were sure of the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left side they see the monkeys , which recovered itself spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of his original performance from injury .
he is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see , when we pl@@ ored the cells : the same monkey , two months after the ad@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also for us very exciting results .
since that time we found out a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze them and use it later .
&quot; we can use them in other new rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for instance at Par@@ kinson . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal himself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know anyone who may need this . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the human being . &quot;
&quot; J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . based on these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies . &quot;
BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
BG : have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies . if you continue to look into the future for how many years it will take to get to hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : this is difficult to say .
&quot; at first , it depends on the approval of clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , one has to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you need to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment at any time .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality , but as invent@@ ories of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable truths .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impres@@ sing growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy comes with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was un@@ ambiguous to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to affect the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought it would probably be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my Auf@@ zucht of my friends that would repeat me if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe , together with me , again to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a tru@@ thful and def@@ ective democracy . &quot;
&quot; for without democracy our societies are painted , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; regarding extravag@@ ance , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is at present our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , which thro@@ ws its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash which , however , is one of fear@@ ful cash , which however is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income could contribute with which to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months in the United States , in England and in the Eurozone , 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , roads , pav@@ ements , and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ llion dollars will sound a lot of money , until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ llion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did except the bor@@ row blows and the real estate rates . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital make the twin summit , which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and consequently a low pan @-@ economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest . just like O@@ dense father , who would not invest in a low demand that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
ref@@ lies the circumstances leading to this cause oils to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely dev@@ oti@@ onal Art All the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are critical for saving the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe it . but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the public and the poor as a majority control the government .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy naturally ended too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy due to these out@@ degrees . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the ath@@ ic democracy was and is that she was working on freedom of expression , and not only the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , giving them the right to political co@@ determination with equal representation in questions of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian Democracy has not been held for a long time --
&quot; like a candle , which glo@@ ws very bright , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our contemporary liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy increased to the free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which ultimately was a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations - a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; today , in our democracies today , the separation of politics and the economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , and the economy gradually explo@@ ded politics . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer like they used to be ?
it is not in a degeneration of their DNA .
it is because they can be in the government today and still do not in power because the power of politics is emigr@@ ated into the economy and the areas are separated .
I mentioned my ha@@ ired with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it &apos;s like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that are so sustain@@ ably the animals that they nourished so sustain@@ ably that they are star@@ ed at the end . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the policies dimin@@ ished by the self @-@ causing economic crisis itself . the power of corporations grows , political goods are de@@ valu@@ ated , inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful under capitalism the &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ elled from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if the &quot; &quot; Dem@@ os &quot; &quot; control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , of women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t really good .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can regain just a position as in the ancient Athens , without creating new species of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism is doing it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ omy through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , the automation can be higher the twin @-@ summit , the waste of waste , and the social conflicts deeper , just as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we need to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and in doing so that we can see the re@@ united area , otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that lets the film &quot; matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievement , which he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; or through something that the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; resembles , in the machines the people serve , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks to the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it look like , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the field of enterprises : ask for a capital market where you earn money , while working and in which your capital follows you from a work@@ site to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all incomes come from capital and income , and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies but not to work in it , and employees who work there , but not big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no major gaps in the twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy , please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely shifting exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging economies &#93; , in the interest of the whole of mankind . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in that currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; cosmos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investments are scarce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes had proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time the technical means had not been implemented .
&quot; today we have them , especially before the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which she pre@@ fers privileged people , and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ word . &quot;
but above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy .
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we will make a political decision together .
it is in our hands and we do it better .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant then Marx &apos;s relevant .
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do this , technological development will produce a massive decline of overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer is called &quot; long @-@ term stagnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis to a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies , but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; as Hay@@ ek , this is why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely hospitable . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r do not think enough .
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein that said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers , you told very clearly what you can see from the point of view of the West in China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my talk , we have limited democracy to policy during the area where most of the economy plays , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I may say so pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error that historically considered .
liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , such as John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
&quot; he was very skep@@ tical about what the democratic development affects . &quot;
&quot; what can be observed now in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; China now suggest to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of ha@@ y to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many list@@ eners are curious about your experience as the Greek finance minister .
Y@@ V : I found that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal view , and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely from the self @-@ suffici@@ ency to adopt , and the persistent denial is that a massive displ@@ ac@@ ement line by the Eurozone continues , and continues to continue the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- the way , the first proposal was , which revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; right . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continues to deny the denial . &quot;
&quot; however , you know what is coming . &quot;
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system , which is not viable , can delay life through political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what change do you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change their construction .
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any Minister , who is in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he claimed no mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for the extension of the debt program at the end of February .
&quot; I believed there was an honest interest on the sides of the don@@ ors , finding a common solution . &quot;
but that did not exist .
they merely wanted to bring our government to fall just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions caused by the Eurozone .
they did not want to conce@@ de that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; great depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Troika of creditors , which has imposed us this policy , and a : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive t@@ ons of talks , you seem to be still quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the eurozone is facing someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if they are not survived , they will be demon@@ ic , and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disastrous for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest business in the world .
&quot; when we suggest ourselves to hit the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , it seems to me , it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you so much that you were at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; by Roy Price , most of which have never been heard , even though he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that &apos;s going back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago .
Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production facility of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a yellow @-@ term and describes on Twitter as &quot; movies , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because it is responsible for producing the shows and content to produce the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard working industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner . &quot;
this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will get this review .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; , &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , the addic@@ tive , where , after having seen a season , your brain asks , &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left side , here at this end , shows how &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve , because I think you need a special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he turns out more about the average explo@@ iting , the average television -- the shows , which are neither good nor bad , they simply do not inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is available , and of course it is also the first time Amazon so doing something , that &apos;s why Roy Price does not want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he requires guaranteed success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses for a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online wherever they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon gives free things out , it is easy to address , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they don &apos;t know that they are observed in the watch of these shows . &quot;
they are observed by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you record when one starts the show when one p@@ auses , which parts one ski@@ ps and check again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with this data which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from it the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com over four Republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that many may not remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.@@ 4 amounts and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time with another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . its name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but it does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x viewers , so the reviews they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to figure out these little details about the audience , which shows they like what producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has hit a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that this should work with everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet , then you should be able to make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computer .
&quot; what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work out , then this is somewhat fri@@ ghtening because we live in a time where we will find more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know here the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes in touch with this software . come in touch with it , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if anyone is in prison in the United States and ask for dis@@ mis@@ sal , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ mis@@ sal is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results produced . this is not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data .
even the data sealed companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that it is known through data analysis of the flu , the di@@ vi@@ cious way - through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly well , year around year until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work out , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these bugs stream data flows into decisions of life - at work , in the workplace , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people are able to use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer treatment &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have detected some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you need to solve a complex problem , do mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; as a result , you put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the components ; as a broad range you put together the parts again to summar@@ ise a decision . &quot;
sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things : get apart and put together again .
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ integrate a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
&quot; for this , there is another tool and we all possess it all : our brain . &quot;
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it &apos;s parts and pieces to get together again , even if the information is incomplete to then get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I believe that Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and mind where they belong to the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what otherwise they would not have been capable of . but the decision on how to take all of these parts again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; which was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show that meant they left a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their choices , first as they show TV ideas , then as they selected &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they say to us the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool , and in order not to forget , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before data was collected , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here at this moment .
I will try it later with a techni@@ c .
&quot; so far , I met some decisions in my life so I should have heard in the ball on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more folded , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; so perhaps the ball is wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I see this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off , decisions to meet , an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; by the end , it is not the data but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks lovely .
