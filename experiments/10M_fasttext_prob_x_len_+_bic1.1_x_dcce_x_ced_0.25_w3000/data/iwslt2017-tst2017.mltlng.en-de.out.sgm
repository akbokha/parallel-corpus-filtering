<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA was illegal phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic US intelligence cooperation in which the CIA placed literally cutting for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if the crazy sounds, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not eat the chapter at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government against Risen has been determined and asked him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol for the pattern of government, whistleblower to condemn and reap journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional Treaty, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the mute they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government joined Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, it happened something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they were given for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, the reporter and springs can hide more and less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and income to the statements, they could also do their digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, his phone call is secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, financial and banking information, its credit-purpose, and even travel-wise with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that used them to judge Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and risens's source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect Whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all the US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government gets too much of their work as secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"thus, we put the press work protected by the first constitutional record, because the government has more possibilities to pick out all of them."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the technology of the government allows the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in fact, they can take the right from the moment in which they contact, rather than in retrospect, in witness."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that there was not yet, when Risen had written his book, and it is much more secure than normal e-mails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source system for whistleblowers which was originally developed from the Internet famous Aaron Swartz, which was developed by us from the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"if you want to send an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload and send documents, as with any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the relevant news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government does not procure more information secretly, and many of the information they would require would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately governments around the world are developing new spy-based technologies, which are all jeopardized us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is time to ensure that not only technology torch such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to bring missetters. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">"the information about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers knows and will report from crowded hospitals. or the next environmental colleague, the alarm strikes the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet insider, which warned us prior to the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"nevertheless, these technologies were not only made for those who want to cover the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on 3 April 2016, the largest data collection of history was published.] [the" "Panama Papers" "contained that Reiche and moaning] have hidden in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we bate Robert Palmer of Global Waves were hidden in Panama.] This week we have been based on news about a Leck of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to the very first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that a ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad stamp-Assad in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia President Vladimir Putin will lead to a close friend of children's days, a famous cellist."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who are nervous on the next release, and waiting for the next unveiled documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the Plot of an agency-editor or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems that wine is from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we address what?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global whales, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens will be used by a few of them to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we have been discussing and reveal for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people appearing this whole world very confusing, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens function."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like an Matrjoschkapara.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, in another company what makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">It can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities as well as to journalists or civil society really understand what matters.</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the US.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably, because there were no prominent Americans in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans to hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by principle, after which these tax havens function, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples to see the connections in the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some U.S. states need less information to provide less information to establish a company than to obtain a librarian."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to avert school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has been allowed to avert especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Ward we wanted to find out how all this is in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator to the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">"we really shocked that all of us made a lawyer of our investigators, how he could transfer his money."</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all happenings. none of these lawyers accepted us as clients, and of course no one was handed over to anyone else. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">"it is not about a single lawyer, who has put forward-down proposals."</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leaders, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to face this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change rules in order to make this kind of behavior difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very disturbing, as if we could do anything about it; as if nothing had ever changed, as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But when born optimist I don't see that a lot has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have seen the impulses to greater transparency on what the owners of companies are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="86">The topic took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU captured in central registers at national level, who really is behind firms in Europe, and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US deposited here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global whales this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, which are angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind them."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, who stand up and say:" "transparency is not good for business." ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians, who recognize the problem and campaigning to end this kind of transparency through laws."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finish the intransparency which now allows this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was abducted almost once and in the trunk of a red mayer."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a backyard sales."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy stayed in the red mada and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my artwork.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip all the country. after that he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep then? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," "I don't know."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">"what do I do now?"</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I now have to offer a sleeping place?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him. he says, he would go to the peace corps, but I don't know if he really is planning this. I don't abducts the trunk of a mazap!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">"then I heard me say," I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room. "</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my mind said:" "h, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought," Oh dear! what I put in my room? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild milder sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, on the tipinny to the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The artwork that he had bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"maybe the people, who were sold to me in childhood as foreigners, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accommodate people on my air mattress, it was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress with you."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us take a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleite, my roommate attracts, and the rent will be increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe creativity can create it, to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I survived like we could make something about it. our apartment will stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, including a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wood-floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure our cheese-ham's cheek tasted completely different, because we did it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all over the city. when we have passed our last guest and fell to the castle, starting Brian and me."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we want to create a website, on the people public pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">They can then invite them to other foreign people to stay overnight in them.</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not act.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still very consolation, would invest in a shop who allowed foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we as children all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you have a look at the things you can do. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and apathy -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to make objects designed, but now we wanted to create trust through design immense trust between people who have never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be able to do something?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a tasters, which degree of trust we owe."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfortzone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumb high if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your entless mobile phone to your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this quietly stop of panic, which you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts will feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"for the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, your home is home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the wiped cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most are felt the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"so, most of the guests feel when they are staying elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just that, who has now Al Gores Handy?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you proclaim to Twitter for the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones to now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail about this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor would have imagined once again with his name, if he tells, whence he comes, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 respondents, all say," "he can really stick very well against mobile phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A good feedback system strengthens confidence.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">"it was hard for the people, to give negative assessments."</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guest had handed their opinions before we made them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we have conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are at the age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprise we trust the people most who like us at the most like.</seg>
<seg id="179">The more differences we find the less we trust.</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social predisposition.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting, when you add the call of a person -- in our case by terms of view."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three terms, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation holds common commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"moreover, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you are left."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first news of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how to" "hi!", "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"tell me much, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal level of openness, e.g." "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I do with my family holiday."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">"our whole company builds on hoping that the right design can help, to overcome our prejudices against strangers."</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great deal of people who were more than willing to put these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a demand that had not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">The business works very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are also times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed parties to be celebrated or aped apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have been able to leave guests in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came straight to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the front line, when confidence has been broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing scarf than these phone calls. it does hurt when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the callers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, from the 123 million saved nights only a fraction ever had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people are familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">"one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there, he suffered a heart attack."</seg>
<seg id="212">His host took him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">"perfect house for travelers, who tend to go to heart attack due to sitting activities."</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protrugel who can save life, even though they don't know anything."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car into the hospital when you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to be lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">"you can even stay longer, without charge the extra nights."</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So of course not every stay is running.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind pure money-action are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"for the first time I stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing with money transactions together?</seg>
<seg id="226">This is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but it is now just to call" "rental industry", "the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">People lay a part of themselves open and that is changing everything.</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel today, this is to compare with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but not authentically authentically."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what would be if traveling a rich buffet from local impressions would be?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what would be if at any place you have visited, a group there Ansässiger would wait to fill a thorough and show one on a Kneipour district, one of which has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground to the togethers?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces, which belonged to the government."</seg>
<seg id="240">"now, residents are offered. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were pulled out. there were incubator programs.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy. over our platform alone, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a foreigner or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">The idea seems to be not as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitability there were even before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our work done?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we indicated that you can find the right design with the components of the trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome profound prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Downright overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I don't have to think about when a red mada goes past me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We naturally know that design cannot solve any problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we could use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you see me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brain-laundering, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I will not blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"so, the media are people who look like me."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims are negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak to their uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslims: it is great, you will know."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- doubling espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted</seg>
<seg id="271">A Möchtease-Fitness fanatics in Germany</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided on this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to outing me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual human, as some of my friends, but as Muslimine. I decided to wear the hijab, my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppressed yourself?</seg>
<seg id="278">"the trial was: at that time, it was a feminist independence, namely against the pressure I felt as 17-year-old, made me a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have discussed with the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked, doubted, and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was confidence and slow dedication which deepened up with every reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to wines.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feel that someone perceives you, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and lived basically the" Egyptian American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had an early breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eilding "." "</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, airplanes flew in buildings, people splitting from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned quickly in rebellion.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I moved the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"... "..."... "in the name of Islam,..."... "..."... "..." "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country being attacked, but in the nu reconciling me the actions of others from a civil war into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">The same day we had to drive through the Middle West of the USA to go into a new city and start with the start of the start.</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I went in silence -- so deep it went to my seat, and I feared the first time as Muslimine to be recognized."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in our apartment, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said," "be alert," "Seid gently", "" Staying in well lit areas, "" Versammmed you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week indoors.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather to prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting of reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or people who held responsible for Muslims in the free war."</seg>
<seg id="311">There was really braces on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something felt not right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I survived the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to have to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">They are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">Today we can actually hear people say: "there is a problem in that country -- it is called Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go wrong? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my community like a tumor in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only poses the question: are we malicious or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor can be removed as a whole and a benign tumor just under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are like all the other Americans, no tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers - First and Olympionians.</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be perhaps a few parking free, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith tolerant, and greater citizens' participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like a leader of the police in the Washington, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"the radicalization process is determined that he begins online. as a result the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremist group can make a brain-laundering which causes terrorists to be the true Muslims, and anyone who hears their behavior and ideology is a betrayal or from faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicals, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Quran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as Muslimine, as mother, as a mother, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">"but we would add to their imagination, if you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers."</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku club Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">"both groups claim their ideology reasons in their" "Holy Book". ""</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if one throws a look at it, it is not driving them what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam told me recently an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she imagined to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every spiritual, with whom she had spoken, she brought to silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given their anger sense, it was a main target for the instrumentalization by extremists that promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accuse them for their anger, he showed their constructive way for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, it did before that to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as the Islamophobia come to me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affects our democracy every day, on our thoughts of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">One study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear that at least three things happen.</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study reveals: if you report a test, in which negative about Muslims, they also have more military attack on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academical problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">If you look when the mood against Muslims - between 2001 and 2013 - it happened three times but never happened in connection with terrorist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to the Moslem terror as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool for manipulating the public to compensate the foundation of a free society, which has rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may sense it as first, but the toxic air of fear leaves us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">In the assignment of collectivism it is not just about having to explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsmen.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was on the dental faculty, talented, promising, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would say to me that he was the sweetest, generous person, whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when is such a wasted young man turned out?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne at her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, she was murdered, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, which was visiting the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as with a execution, after he posted expressions against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shovel eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Have we gone to the mosque or we were safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we possessed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided on the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son at the seat of the child, we drove welding, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, moved my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw, caused me to stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked him and was welcomed to our guests, because half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came to us, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I am collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure to go to number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those that mean: we are better than that.</seg>

<seg id="411">You can also build autonomously loadable structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to bear loads to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to exceed the limits of the Possible flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus a system autonom works, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at the ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. that enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localisation technology from Verity Studios, an integral part of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each air machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest image. for example," "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">This is a so-called Heckstarter.</seg>
<seg id="422">A leaflet that tries to beat two flies with a cap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in advance-moving, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float outside, and has a large number of advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">However there is always a downside.</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of heckers is that they are sensitive to turmoil like wind bows.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controllers and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the air device doesn't matter what position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often provide basic abstract issues that lead to the core of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the small number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known about as machinery with a thousand movable parts that work together to injure you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"two decades ago, trained pilots managed to fly remotely controlled air devices, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a tailruder."</seg>
<seg id="435">Long ago we discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">This is the monospinner that mechanically easiest and served airplanes. it was invented recently.</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no clapping, hinges and cross-rupulls, no further pitches or controls, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, in the inner life very much, so that it can fly stable and moving in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the cushion. to bring it to flying, I need to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability, it's right to throw when I all watch, is low, therefore I show you a video that filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the moon is an exercise in weakness, this machine is here, the omkopter with his eight propellans, one exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this overflow?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is ambivalent in his alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"by doing so, he receives the remaining capacity,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is rotated or even as he rotate."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight foams."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest will learn directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see it in.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliably."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is made up of two separate two-propellers machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- can fly the machine even if limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate that by doing half a plane.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is investigating synthetic swarming.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took negotiable micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think new revolutionary ideas.</seg>

<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was given into space-time fabric and the universe is exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us arrange the events at first time.</seg>
<seg id="476">Thirteen billion years ago had just emerged on Earth.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the earth brought a lot out: corals, fish, plants, saurier, people and -- God stand up to us - even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech - to build a giant laser detector to search for Gravitonwaves that arise from collious black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most they held them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people realized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed its idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector LIGO: the laser-interferometer - gravitational-rotary observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of LIGO could be increased significantly, which increase the performance output enormously improved."</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why we now call it Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, LIGO was launched for a recent test run to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two collapsed black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell of my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically these were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for, is no longer Science Fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist in the MIT. he studied for 23 years of gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crocodification in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire contents are stretched in one direction and are stretched into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to illustrate faculty, teachers in courses for relativity theory often lead to a really alberal dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational-waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each one of us was stretched out during the meeting of the waves and drilled. the elongation of an average person was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"this means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, one explained the LIGO staff for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length would be reduced to less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic wall. that is most grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravity.</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGHas, the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are tremendous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are fineful, and with the support of the public certainly all obstacles will be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">Thorne was published in 1973 and 42 years before its success.</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more than an eye than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your mobile."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite handy. because you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you by several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">In sounds the other is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that will make you particularly much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen after certain properties such as clay and height, rhythm and volume, to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks to Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob underbreaks them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make easy pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by careful about changes in the amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least there are for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible area.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns in molall, we can literally talk the whole."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity for laughing, can tell us about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not revolving holes, circus simple: bet!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same pineapple with an additional key change. this sounds like Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a type of movement, shapes in the wavelform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date, which at least I never forget -- heard LIGO Folders, who knows what he has to hear, see this as the noise of -- SH:... two black holes with the 30-facher solar mass, which can turn around as fast as the sticks of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 sones, the other with a mass of 36 sones, revolve each one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the constant importance of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO paves a completely new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the all and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why the stars in super-novae would explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about this.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes are happening in the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers from iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never be seen since these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it would be transparent glass. the jungle would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them, since the jungle is shining through his own light-shine."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves it should be possible, to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of whom we have no idea of what we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact LIGO found the same in the very first attempt, which we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars, the black holes produce, as LIGO they observed are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, age-old bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the leaved bones for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO allows us to have an entirely different angle of view of the events, in all, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we went out of this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists of being as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and circulation of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the jungle?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of big dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>

<seg id="577">"but it also has a striking side-effect: only recently, I understood completely, that the" "Yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am author, I think of things, go out for life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I am talking television. I Producers TV.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, in large style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for spending 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">Four television programs for 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production.</seg>
<seg id="588">"each shipment offers hundreds of jobs, which previously didn't exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV channel can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TVs, 70 hours TV, three shows, 3 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million spectators."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours broadcasts that I have created myself, and not only produced, so still obendlessly. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans around campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire, all around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who that is still doing?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, that's why I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I would not like to impress you with them.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you, so that all of you who work so hard if you are now a company, a country or a classroom, so you understand that I'm not just hanging around a computer and imaginative, and it is true when I say, I understand that it is not a dreamjob for dreaming."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything reality, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I'm working a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">When I get absorbed into the work there is no other feeling.</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set the troops up, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"for example, you stand a high tone, lying a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">One feels like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best thing is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working out well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums of it sounds like a busy road, I could always drive on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"a lot of people accept when I declare to them the buzz, that I'm writing writing, that writing my writing."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the buzz -- when I began working with television production, when I began to work and work, build and working, I discovered this matter, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz of God is the voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, you can't be different from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not to be able to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it means ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I know only that I am not made for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make clear: the more successful I get, the more the more time, the more overs, the more work there are, the more the more things I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations are there."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more you have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I-monkey, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the sums, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then stops the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overlaid, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The buzz stops.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mom is a single worker at the institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mom will not be there but you can write my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "estimating, I want to go to Shonda Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby-titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totaling of the engine was walled.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my job anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The buzz did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sums was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, reworked weekends, no reue, nothing deleaves, one Titan sleeps, does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TVs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TVs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a show-Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was gray, I simply had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" "Heul you out, blonde of the author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you work, you love to be a teacher, a painter, a mother, one loves to know one another, and knows how the sums you know, when you stop the buzz, who is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"listening to the song of my heart, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I put my "southern-state waitress" to me.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late off and she says," "mommy, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no more than two things to be aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It does not call anyone more.</seg>
<seg id="676">When is that happened?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan, and my sums arise, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "mommy, do you play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and run their sisters, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book 'Everybody Poops'."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the solitude and in the absence of the immense, I can do nothing but to match."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I-monkey, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists sticky finger and humid kisses, delicate voices, waver-pens and the song in which it is going to release, or whatever the girl in" The EisQueen "." "</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so close that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I atme.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door walks up and an energy shoes comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happened."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the buzz, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I would know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay in the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the titanium-hummen, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, if I describe myself with the broadcasts and TV lessons and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The buzz is not a force and it is not specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz depends on the love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the stream that comes from my lust.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the complete tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispering to God the wrong words, for whom God told me that I am an Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">Once my child wants to play with me I will say yes.</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free me as a workaholic of any fault."</seg>
<seg id="719">It is law; I have no other choice. I have no other choice unless I want to hear the buzz again.</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I am not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"do not play Cratbilise, how we work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurts;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like it to play.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at the workplace as home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entry is painful, because what kind of man works rather than being home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushing soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mainly stiff, absent, and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always wanted to go to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why did we ever ceased with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! do they always tell if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you hold me for naïve for a daydreams.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you will be right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet show.</seg>
<seg id="745">You can find your child less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my babies want to play with me at most 15 minutes, up to them that they want something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkins or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and I speak my teenie-daughter whole 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more than it does not require."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can take 15 minutes on the piece even at a bad-day-day!</seg>
<seg id="753">At least 15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children were praying."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is true to feel the sums of being a place for peace peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with their own children. it is about joy</seg>
<seg id="759">Around the "Games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I scissors and I siege. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">Want to play? "is short for everything I got up when I got my first TV show when I got a Titan in the training when I wanted to exceed myself more and more.</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes a piece of why not full 15 minutes treat?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be false? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return when I do not work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working is not working without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flowing in and I find myself in my office. I hear a familiar melody, she meets me and my soul. I use it into new ideas. I use it to full and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I need it not.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz of sums it is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends. "</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The buzz of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the buzz of work is part of me, but just a part of it. and I am so grateful for this."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is me that I am a Titan, I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">"yes, I said Yes to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires still burn.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>

<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, jumping, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think of things, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks lovely.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodily organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a severe violation of the central nervous system the patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical treatment.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely, they have heard of one of the most prominent, the" "Low-stag stimulation". "thereby, one implates an electrode depth in the brain to influence the neurons of neurons so that neurological functions are improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson who suffered under fierce trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation means not Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream Functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading lieder and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I have patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that at skull-Hirn-traumas the brain irritated and the cranial-pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, one has to diminish the skull of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">That's why one sometimes has to remove a part swollen brain.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the slipped brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist, the brain."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from that tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"cells from one tissue, grow to grow, is comparable to very small children who will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the proper diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many trials it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">It was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with big green cells, surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Maybe you still know from the BiologieLearning Spanish that stem cells are unmature cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissues of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells stopped differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but was different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long to understand, where they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">You make up 4% of our large-stag cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the stage of the fetus they ensure the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">"we are facing a potential cell source, which allows brain healing."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-language area and then cultivate the cells exactly as it did Jean-François</seg>
<seg id="853">And they subsequently mark coloured to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we applauded it at the earliest of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist transplant -- autobahn planning.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we promote these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we are plotting the same cells in the digging brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we could work with monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we plotted the cells into a healthy brain, and we watched that after a few weeks they had completely disappeared, they go back home. the room is already occupied, so they will not disappear there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we feed an injury and peaned exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been refined.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these small points. these are the cells that we used in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">Here we could not stop.</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we have monkeys with a manual deskill task."</seg>
<seg id="866">You had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made them very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they achieved a stable skill level, we injured the handmotoric range in the motoric cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"thereupon, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to people, they spontaneously recovered to some degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralyzed, and then they try to recover with the help of sculptural braisms. they are a certain degree, as well as the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were sure of the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left side they see the monkeys, which recovered itself spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of his original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">He is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see, when we plored the cells: the same monkey, two months after the adplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also for us very exciting results.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we found out a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use it later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other new ropathological models, for instance at Parkinson."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal himself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know anyone who may need this. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question of what the greatest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies at the human being."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. based on these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc. "</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: have a look at the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start the clinical studies. if you continue to look into the future for how many years it will take to get to hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: this is difficult to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"at first, it depends on the approval of clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose patients to perform treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, one has to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you need to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment at any time.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>
<seg id="899">"BG: Jocelyne, thank you for your visit to TED and that you have told us about it."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant that it is in reality, but as inventories of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable truths.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressing growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy comes with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece - the newly elected Greek government -- was unambiguous to me that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- not to affect the austerity programmes that have been realized in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought it would probably be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my Aufzucht of my friends that would repeat me if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to introduce an economic model for real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe, together with me, again to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a truthful and defective democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"for without democracy our societies are painted, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"regarding extravagance, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is at present our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash which, however, is one of fearful cash, which however is too anxious to invest where it would be productive and income could contribute with which to wear the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months in the United States, in England and in the Eurozone, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in all the wealth of producing goods, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, roads, pavements, and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars will sound a lot of money, until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars that were at the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did except the borrow blows and the real estate rates."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital make the twin summit, which is not equal to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and consequently a low pan-economic demand that could not invest in which they would not invest. just like Odense father, who would not invest in a low demand that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Reflies the circumstances leading to this cause oils to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely devotional Art All the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are critical for saving the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe it. but before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the public and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian Democracy naturally ended too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the significance of the athic democracy due to these outdegrees."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the athic democracy was and is that she was working on freedom of expression, and not only the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, giving them the right to political codetermination with equal representation in questions of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian Democracy has not been held for a long time --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which glows very bright, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our contemporary liberal democracies did not have their roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy increased to the free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for mistress."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation between politics and the economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations - a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"today, in our democracies today, the separation of politics and the economy began, a relentless struggle between the two, and the economy gradually exploded politics."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer like they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">It is because they can be in the government today and still do not in power because the power of politics is emigrated into the economy and the areas are separated.</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my haired with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it's like a herd of carnivores that are so sustainably the animals that they nourished so sustainably that they are stared at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the policies diminished by the self-causing economic crisis itself. the power of corporations grows, political goods are devaluated, inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing director of corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful under capitalism the" "Demos" "[the people] expelled from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour power and prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that is true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again and it would be better if the" "Demos" "control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, of women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't really good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can regain just a position as in the ancient Athens, without creating new species of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism is doing it by replacing Niedrigloomy through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, the automation can be higher the twin-summit, the waste of waste, and the social conflicts deeper, just as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we need to reconstruct the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and in doing so that we can see the reunited area, otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance hyperautocracy that lets the film" matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not whether capitalism has brought the technical achievement, which he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopia, similar to the" matrix "or through something that the society in" Star Trek "resembles, in the machines the people serve, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it look like, how could it look like this" star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the field of enterprises: ask for a capital market where you earn money, while working and in which your capital follows you from a worksite to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all incomes come from capital and income, and the concept of wage labor is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies but not to work in it, and employees who work there, but not big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no major gaps in the twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy, please make sure that our national currencies would have a freely shifting exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging economies], in the interest of the whole of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"furthermore, imagine that the entire world trade is traded in that currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum which corresponds to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the respective country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investments are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes had proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time the technical means had not been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially before the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberating, in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and work in the dustbin of history, and Keynesian, global keyword."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all others it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar Dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we will make a political decision together.</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>

<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis to a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>

<seg id="986">"as Hayek, this is why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely hospitable."</seg>

<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my talk, we have limited democracy to policy during the area where most of the economy plays, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I may say so provocative, China resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error that historically considered.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism, Liberals, such as John Stuart Mill -- "</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was very skeptical about what the democratic development affects."</seg>

<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>

<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- the way, the first proposal was, which revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"right. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"however, you know what is coming."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"by Roy Price, most of which have never been heard, even though he is likely to be responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That's going back to the decision that Roy met for three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is leading employee at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production facility of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a yellow-term and describes on Twitter as" movies, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because it is responsible for producing the shows and content to produce the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard working industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy is not able to select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the review goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows will get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" "Breaking Bad," "The Wire", "The Wire" -- all the shows, the addictive, where, after having seen a season, your brain asks, "where is there more of these episodes?"</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left side, here at this end, shows how" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve, because I think you need a special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras. ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he turns out more about the average exploiting, the average television -- the shows, which are neither good nor bad, they simply do not inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is available, and of course it is also the first time Amazon so doing something, that's why Roy Price does not want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he requires guaranteed success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes lots of ideas for TV shows and chooses for a evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts it online wherever they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon gives free things out, it is easy to address, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they don't know that they are observed in the watch of these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are observed by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you record when one starts the show when one pauses, which parts one skips and check again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with this data which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from it the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom over four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that many may not remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- as the average of this curve 7.4 amounts and Alpha House ends at 7.5 -- something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about at the same time with another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. its name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but it does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix viewers, so the reviews they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to figure out these little details about the audience, which shows they like what producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards "." Netflix has hit a hit, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that this should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data for a decision that you meet, then you should be able to make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work out, then this is somewhat frightening because we live in a time where we will find more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know here the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-health system is a software company and I hope that no one in this space ever comes in touch with this software. come in touch with it, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if anyone is in prison in the United States and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of decide whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results produced. this is not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data sealed companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that it is known through data analysis of the flu, the divicious way - through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly well, year around year until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work out, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data sealed companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these bugs stream data flows into decisions of life - at work, in the workplace, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people are able to use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer treatment"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have detected some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you need to solve a complex problem, do mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"as a result, you put this problem into its parts so that you can analyse the components; as a broad range you put together the parts again to summarise a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">Sometimes you have to do this several times but there are always two things: get apart and put together again.</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disintegrate a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">"for this, there is another tool and we all possess it all: our brain."</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it's parts and pieces to get together again, even if the information is incomplete to then get a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I believe that Netflix was so successful because they have used data and mind where they belong to the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what otherwise they would not have been capable of. but the decision on how to take all of these parts again and make it a show like" House of Cards "which was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show that meant they left a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their choices, first as they show TV ideas, then as they selected" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they say to us the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool, and in order not to forget, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before data was collected, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball". it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will try it later with a technic.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far, I met some decisions in my life so I should have heard in the ball on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more folded, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so perhaps the ball is wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I see this as very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data still pays off, decisions to meet, an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"by the end, it is not the data but the risks that you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks lovely.</seg>
