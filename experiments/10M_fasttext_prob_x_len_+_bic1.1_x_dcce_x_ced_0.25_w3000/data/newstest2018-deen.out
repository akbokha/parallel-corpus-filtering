Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that make your view of the city
a Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people today should meet .
&quot; a greeting , where now is excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers manage the one reason for farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to spend days .
it &apos;s more nervous when land@@ cards are not up to date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had to look back for , because the car Nav@@ i takes place instead of a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical map of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bayern of the State Government , are anything but current - but is therefore very conclu@@ sive . &quot;
especially when you compare them with current online cards .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Munich has changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that can be seen as such .
&quot; in the wide coverage map , for cities and communities were more detailed maps , so @-@ called ur@@ posi@@ tional sheets . &quot;
this resulted in the statements of the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying administration between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and in the beginning of the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your client : Napoleon .
the French He@@ er@@ es@@ man occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War War with Austria .
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and had a top@@ ographic record of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally , if the French troops have finally moved to the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : today &apos;s neighbours , who created the idea of an area @-@ wide Bavaria card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; &quot; top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ qui@@ al leaf for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bav@@ arian National Library .
the comparison of early / Today is the example of the provincial capital in the most impressive .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
one example of this is sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 .
&quot; Send@@ ling was born 21 years after the map of the map , so 1877 , as Munich &apos;s district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses sub@@ sen@@ d@@ lings focus around 18@@ 56 along the current Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the rebellion of the Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : in addition , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ written fl@@ aps from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small par@@ c@@ els do not occupy themselves there today - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green space is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 swing of the October fes@@ ts , was in the 19th century still a meadow , and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine .
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s District Ch@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district of A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only the road name &quot; at the Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the ascent &quot; On the Lü@@ nen &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse pl@@ ung@@ ing people with madness . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich Circle @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt was created in 18@@ 58 / 59 . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard from Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and ended the qu@@ ettes of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; he also forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anst@@ alt . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients there was first place , later it was extended to 500 seats . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ East is one of Germany &apos;s biggest psychiat@@ rist . &quot;
&quot; on the A@@ real of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people now meet in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 , and walked it into a youth @-@ home with training establishments . &quot;
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east residential houses dating from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children of the house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; set up at the origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt , which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombar@@ d@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was named 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße named &quot; &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich .
the bombs of the Al@@ lies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business buildings and a Gru@@ ft@@ kap@@ elle from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days will work and will take place on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ ders , the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
Citiz@@ enship group published travel service for Mis@@ sour@@ i
&quot; the national Association for the promotion of coloured colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i , due to discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to come into force up to 28 August 2017 , visits af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans , as a series of questionable , r@@ ums @-@ based incidents can occur in the entire state and here , &quot; says it in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it people harder to gain discrimination against minorities , as well as the prosecution bodies of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , caused the group to recover the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of the civil rights , the people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are put together or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
&quot; we hear complaints in such a frequency , which we have not yet heard . &quot;
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group ren@@ oun@@ ces such as rac@@ ist trans@@ gres@@ sions against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no gasoline any more during the journey through the state and was put in custody by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Adv@@ ant@@ ant of Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; Chapel . &quot;
people need to be ready to bring home @-@ money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i promised 100 hate crime in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate @-@ breaking @-@ reporting program of the F@@ BI that ranks the State in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to complain a company due to residential or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ation Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) had published travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona , after the states of immigration law had to commit people to prohi@@ bit the local law enforcement authorities , which will contribute to further racial violations , according to the opinion of AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel orders are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
Wei@@ l@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the fisheries bacher Wei@@ de@@ fence @-@ Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Convention of Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have gained a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ grab@@ en@@ hof of the family Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann , representatives of the fisher@@ man CD@@ U @-@ village met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann granted first insight into its operation in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , and also many young animals and housed in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternate mark@@ eters for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este comes exclusively region@@ ales .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman of fishing bach , he referred to the &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not produce any ab@@ rupt areas not profitable .
&quot; the green area , for much work , much has to be processed with the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 he took over the par@@ ental operation and managed to run it without any chemical plant protection and fer@@ til@@ isers , even if he do not conduct any bio @-@ operation . &quot;
&quot; for Mayor Thomas Schneider , Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Comm@@ une has recognized the importance of the ordination project and is glad about the leader of the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
we hope that the for@@ estation of the areas could be moved up for quite a while .
&quot; the greatest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thinking about how they continue their operation , &quot; &quot; stressed the Mayor . &quot;
farmers stand often in criticism because of the support
&quot; as a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
the disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares which are not allowed up to at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted half of the Leader , a quarter carried out by the municipality of Bas@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do not have a really good job , without farmers and women . &quot;
&quot; even for Peter White was fixed : &quot; &quot; here the best food produced is produced . &quot;
Land@@ scap@@ ego@@ at ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ state support of past@@ es .
the goal is the disclosure of the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald .
the presence of one of the L@@ PR signed by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the slo@@ wing surface must not be in@@ sensitive ( H@@ ang@@ nei@@ a@@ over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing bacher Wei@@ ght in 2018 it is currently running the request of eight participants with 24 plots , which would like to build up just 16 kilometres of Zau@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface amounts to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes on the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues .
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump @-@ ré@@ g@@ ime , knew certainly what he did when he had a symbolic A@@ xt over the proposals of the president to dras@@ tic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have helped him if he had done it .
&quot; but he resor@@ ted to their importance , and in particular the meaning that you have attributed to , as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its base was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ained : &quot; I don &apos;t want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is correctly correct , but as he himself formed , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about Lazarus , the only words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only charges any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; your tired , your arms , / your up@@ pressing masses , who desire to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; el@@ dest waste &quot; was better to be seen on our screens .
Miller is not committed to literary critic - he clearly shows that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .
Lazarus - and their friends who settled their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they have accomplished a high political action .
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a reduced classical image .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and she gives herself another name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on the American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people of the right wing had changed this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry as Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone , but rather an early neo@@ conservative , which brings the American flame into the circum@@ vent world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
she is supposed to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on something .
the meaning of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they did from the exhausted , miserable , but hope@@ ful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships was seen . &quot;
&quot; it is the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and of course , this is not the perspective , which Miller and Tr@@ ump should ever recognise . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way , but hate the hate , who is their only source of power , ign@@ iting . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black lo@@ bt Scottish members of the Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two beats to the team of Great Britain belonged
&quot; the Executive Director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ strong Kon@@ t@@ lement will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the guy on the corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m stretch , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected from the team to team capacity . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is rather modest .
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they live or exercising , went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the e@@ ili@@ ie was totally natural of course , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth silver Med@@ al retired , who is playing at their fifth World Championships at the 400 @-@ m hur@@ dle , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 beats in the British team are . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven who were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .
the Mu@@ ir @-@ wing@@ ed Mu@@ ir leads on this road and took up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5.000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman that was included in the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembered her first World Championships when the only other Sch@@ otte in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was .
&quot; the Mann@@ it@@ ant captain tells that she is &quot; enormously proud &quot; on the fact that many of her country@@ men are not only part of the team , but also in some cases the medals and the Fin@@ als join the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special team to be of team captain , is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i who belong to the team . &quot;
it shows only how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
&quot; I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a home world championship . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore really important to put on this home support , and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking by critics about Facebook : Be@@ wir@@ b you not to have a public office if you cannot tolerate the un@@ cover of voters
the father of our land knew something of poor press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it wasn &apos;t long until the newspapers hit him because of everything , from the internal policy to his political principles . &quot;
&quot; he sho@@ ok with criticism , safely . &quot;
but he did not have his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said : &quot; &quot; the freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te we are led as the sheep to the battles . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland under Governor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work on it more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and expressed their opinion on their official fac@@ ebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties promised him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the rod of the Govern@@ ors sent the law@@ suit as fri@@ vo@@ l , and the line comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is just Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important when it is a guy like ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing .
he has the highest level of approval by the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary Hitler head .
he showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very happy to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his ha@@ sty head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the Board of Govern@@ ors - the public forum , which is officially designated as officially , and by co @-@ workers who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing but a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too easy to use the image of tro@@ ut , or pe@@ ers or h@@ ash @-@ filled people who swing online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest presented the Bible in his post and appeals to Ho@@ gans Catholic Faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani from Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ asser@@ ted but she asked for hate crime . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news , she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I appreciate this idea even if a number of people are taking position on the same subject , then they are considered more likely to be considered as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors described as &quot; &quot; concentrated &quot; &quot; spam attack , others would probably call &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment .
it is much cleaner than in former times when you had the same done that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance and to burn demonstrators or to burn prot@@ esters .
but that is exactly what is happening digital .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public officials to critic@@ ise that he imp@@ lied Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week .
&quot; the chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County last the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when she appointed a vot@@ er from her fac@@ ebook @-@ side . &quot;
and in K@@ entu@@ cky governor Matt Be@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from AC@@ L@@ U due to its use of Facebook and Twitter .
it should not be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar impact like the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ lies between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letter driver suggested for his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous trou@@ gh .
&quot; the people , who used pseudon@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius &quot; , &quot; wrote all the letters of newspapers that made Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions that surve@@ yed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ m@@ able his ministry , according to historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not brought them silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , expression and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days in domestic comfort , since the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ to the 25th edition of Scottish Senior Open is organized . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , which resulted in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the end of the next year , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is linked to the new au@@ ti@@ zer and is acting as a tournament message in the name of the club &apos;s green@@ point and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job when he set this place .
he is a busy fe@@ eder of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; English E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European tour in his 32 @-@ year career as well as at the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , since it was in the year after I won them out of the program . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year here to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .
Gary Or@@ r who came to the European senior tour after his 50@@ th birthday in the past year .
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you feel also this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I am glad how we have gone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the trio at the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the senior champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ext@@ . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six sheep in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance is free , the parking costs £ 5 a car with one in@@ mates and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates . &quot;
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ gers through passive tobacco smoke
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive exposure to lung cancer . &quot;
this results are scientists of the University Hospital in Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lung cancer are due to passive tobacco smoke , &quot; said study manager Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he was able to approach his own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer cas@@ u@@ alties for pas@@ si@@ dies per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
jan@@ u@@ sions prove to be very complex
&quot; construction works in the Vill@@ inger Street are in full swing and &quot; &quot; lie &quot; &quot; in the time , &quot; &quot; says the ladder of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the field of household income , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the underground is much for@@ bi@@ ous , which does not notice in plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction work , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the drivers in front of red light and bul@@ lets is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the buses are eligible for transit .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were very ti@@ ring .
&quot; but fortunately we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
when Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i cooks the dinner she does not use any stove .
it even uses only rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ele in the un@@ quiet Indones@@ ian province Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually referred to as &quot; &quot; not@@ a &quot; &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the wi@@ ched kno@@ b will be taken and swal@@ lowed and swal@@ lowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the Leh@@ ism - she has no furniture - where she also performs its daily work , for example , dresses with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a canopy room serves as a lat@@ ch .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned any fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late to work can be dangerous : most villagers are unemployed , and many drink it hard and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody knew it , after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was founded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that stems from independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which has control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or jurisdictions . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part of Pap@@ ua @-@ Neu@@ gu@@ ine@@ as included the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as secluded as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province Capital Com@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there are no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses , surrounded by bam@@ boo and from cor@@ ds roofs that were converted by r@@ ust into various yellow @-@ brown sounds . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , hon@@ orable Me@@ e Pap@@ u@@ ans a God called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not accustomed to wear these clothes , &quot; &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to their lively , handmade tur@@ ban , you darker shirt and their bright rock . &quot;
&quot; previously we only had leaves on our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ent &apos;s province where 28 % of people live under the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ant mortality and alphabe@@ tis@@ ation rates in Asia have .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans Gold@@ land .
&quot; the biggest and profitable Gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has a value of € 3.@@ 1 billion and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua offers over wood resources worth $ 78 billion in billions of dollars . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of misery for Pap@@ ua , which ensure that In@@ don@@ esi@@ on &apos;s military has preserved a er@@ sti@@ cking presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military bases and units between 1998 and 2004 took nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 USD in a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy threaten this Golden G@@ ans and are treated mer@@ c@@ ess@@ ly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 papers were killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed in 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass@@ ages in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal country in the 1970 @-@ s were established under the Asia @-@ Human Committee to commit genocide .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indones@@ ian police killed more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstrators in the past year . &quot;
&quot; we &quot; lose all &quot; it is in a report of the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atrocities of the previous year are popular , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electro@@ des are popular according to another report - and the brutal precip@@ itation of peace demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the bol@@ ts have intensified as Pap@@ u@@ as resources produce a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but the demographic development changes , as Muslim econom@@ ists come from the popul@@ ous islands Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese War@@ ung cant@@ ines sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people fight for staying here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables at the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai -@@ local , who moved to the provincial capital in Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has the native Pap@@ ua - the Mama @-@ Mama , the Women &#93; of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the Indones@@ ian president Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to tackle the inequalities and legal injuries in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the total 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua had changed little , and today the locals feel betrayed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point in October after Jok@@ ow@@ is . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children out there and sang Christmas lie@@ der in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the start@@ led children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off her tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , j@@ agu@@ ed and smote the group with their gun , they told victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was put down in fire and escal@@ ate things in the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of local police station and the Military Commander centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried the cerem@@ onial Jag@@ db@@ ö@@ gen and led the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and an avi@@ e@@ ang im@@ it@@ ating - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago strain .
some demonstrators began to tow stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command via an internal Fun@@ k : &quot; when the masses were more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it is said in an official document of TI@@ ME that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger , calling the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I suddenly shot in my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame is still not known who has fired , but says that the bul@@ let came out of the ranks of the gathered soldiers . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and analysed his body to make sure he was &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who like many In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans only a name , the TI@@ ME in gri@@ mmer mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the editor of the Pap@@ ua @-@ police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said re@@ porters , that his officers wanted to only secure their station , because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more viol@@ ates . &quot;
news about the kill@@ ings came first in the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i stayed in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , a passionate speech in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and sw@@ am the historical dis@@ ks in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I would like that this case will be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; security Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism for con@@ forming historical human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
but the talk began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ er years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must undergo through . &quot;
&quot; then Wir@@ anto made a retreat when he spoke in Jak@@ arta with TI@@ ME , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the Wir@@ anto that accused the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; said more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloo@@ dies@@ t independence from 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua had already been inscri@@ bed , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims took such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed mis@@ fortune .
&quot; I was interviewed during the last three years , but there was no progress &quot; , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I am afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am frightened to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeti@@ tive that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says that he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I had buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ wer@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday oss the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighbourhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the communities and the managers of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , refused to bring an unconscious man into the hospital died a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old R@@ avi@@ e@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was dro@@ wned when in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital . &quot;
Ascen@@ ded villagers prot@@ ested before the sit@@ ing office of the company .
&quot; the police said that the villagers threw the stones at the officers , who re@@ acted upon them by wet warning . &quot;
but natives say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( in@@ dones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot the crowd and killed a killer .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who was living close to the hospital and a witness , as the last one was quickly supplied here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I have been hiding two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai Parliament has called to hold the officers &quot; to account and to withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a disaster for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensual development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal , mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Pap@@ ua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , which claims to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by landing spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to it , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai in the past few years and taken in custody under the pretext of the &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never dive on again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua is Pan@@ i@@ ai as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty rein@@ forces the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the bit of rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here are building everything they eat : mainly not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women to deal with four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces Not@@ a precious only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ia ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants grew , since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire in an increasing number have arrived . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs that exist in the region , usually go to the better educated and aff@@ lu@@ ent migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to compete their own enterprises .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ i , the chairman of the Chief Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on the coverage of international media remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ die and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ in K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign , the restrictions of reporting , to raise transparency and development , is not realised . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March the six paci@@ f@@ fish states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands , and the Sal@@ om@@ onen islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed the pro@@ aches of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights accidents . &quot;
people on site want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of man &apos;s right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura visited her silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source which also participated in the session but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia , 2019 , has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they are probably not going to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai mol@@ dings , &quot; says Gob@@ i , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ People , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , in impover@@ ished education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ i says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; must look back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they only want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ uss@@ offering , the last symbolic act of the Des@@ cent : the Lei@@ che of a victim was buried in a terrain precisely opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they may never get justice to them , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a healthy head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos;s skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; on Friday , a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai its thorough@@ ness and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ story building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is set in just two years by the high@@ house , which is called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were standing under fire alarm and at the scre@@ aming of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get from the 50@@ th floor to come down , &quot; &quot; told a resident who called his name as George Val@@ ang@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 am GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cooler . &quot;
the government said they work on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can rein@@ vigor@@ ate matters to the safety of materials used in outer areas throughout the world .
&quot; an examination by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 yiel@@ ded that the majority of the damages caused by the clothing , external clothing for decoration or insulation . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police officers , they believe that the system of panels for insulation and clothing could have contributed to the rapid spread of a meeting in June , in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : continued Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) was published with his big Davis Cup Cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the two @-@ third @-@ cup group was only supported to play two winners , Hau@@ ch@@ ly does not support the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; although often very long , but also therefore very cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics remain intact to the tradition of tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member countries voted for reform , the target of the IT@@ F @-@ President David Hag@@ ar@@ ty was therefore only slightly absent . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we respect this decision but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; said Hag@@ ar@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the quality .
&quot; not only until the vote had already come to a neutral place after many deposits , the finale in a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are only relatively minor details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future will have the host law in the first round .
&quot; to reduce the cost of the organizer , the requirements are facilitated by training courses , etc . and the players will have to complete the Davis Cup less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
more than 1 of 5 US travelers bring forth out objects to the airplane ; find out a survey
&quot; a survey conducted under air passengers yiel@@ ded that more than 20 per cent of consciously or un@@ consciously processed objects at the check@@ points of the US Transportation Security Administration passed away , including at least 6 percent , which entered the airplane while they carried out accidentally b@@ aked kni@@ ves or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent asser@@ ted , they could have spot@@ ted that they were buried with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey with more than 1,000 people - who was carried out by a Jet @-@ charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ tered Inc . , was also noted that younger travellers rather mis@@ respect the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respondents , the assur@@ ances that they kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned from the T@@ SA was 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common objects that were inten@@ sely populated by T@@ SA agents , were food and fluids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent gave to , kno@@ w@@ ingly made objects with blades carried by the safety control while 2,@@ 2 percent of the female respondents and 3,@@ 7 per cent of the male in@@ quired also confirmed that they would obviously have brought to the plane crash into the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I have asked travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gling smu@@ g@@ ents have been brought by the airport security and how many it had inten@@ sely done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that the people , the most hottest smu@@ g@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ ingly - by the safety , those who were most often fly . &quot;
&quot; the company however points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing . &quot;
&quot; men are often in@@ secure , which liquids may take them or how much of it . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated fluids . &quot;
&quot; for a time the people , the T@@ SA could view books as smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Customer cancel order
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k will be pleased with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so far , he has so far sm@@ iled that a part of the customer has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales growth and another gigantic sales aim , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k has reported for the first time a different , less glorious number : that of the cancellations at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often applied more than 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k is a : from the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders , 6@@ 3,000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is only about non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the U.S. 1000 US dollars and in the United Kingdom 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation deposit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ 5,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations are present in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , that cancellation of up to about twelve per cent of all orders could become a problem , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge with ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la has delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; by 2018 it is supposed to be - all models assembled - 500,000 , 2020 a million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently 1800 reservations per day . &quot;
&quot; who today ordered a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , &quot; must be expected in the second half of 2018 by delivery - if Tes@@ la creates it , its brand new , has never been tested in practice without much inter@@ rup@@ tions with maxim@@ izing relief . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the in@@ filtration of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company can not prevent the satisfied customers from running from af@@ ar . &quot;
EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the delay of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions back
&quot; one day after he had been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the boss of the Environmental Protection Agency , returned to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions in smo@@ g air pollution . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities , faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit filed against his previous place in a Federal Court of Appe@@ als .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to adhere to the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down zone zone . &quot;
&quot; announced in June , that he will delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid taking into local decisions or hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection rules . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly crossed the rules to block or delay the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ding regul@@ ator @-@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a federal government Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority as he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane . &quot;
&quot; in a Sunday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt struck the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilling of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations the EPA has often tried the deadlines for the execution and then waited to be indicted by activ@@ ist@@ groups and others , and in an agreement said the appointment for the execution , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulating jurisdictions , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also accept the law and authority , which gives us serious . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of EPA has said that P@@ ru@@ ill will take up his &quot; authority &quot; delay and all other legally available &quot; &quot; to ensure that the provisions &quot; are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Re@@ public@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone .

tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery A@@ real in turmoil on Sunday , 16 July , at 16.@@ 30 am invited to a seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth fund@@ fi@@ z Seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and conservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of the Tum@@ lin@@ gens .
Walter Martin@@ i stresses : &quot; it is a unique village @-@ small Klein@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was mentioned for the first time in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg &apos;s Ur@@ gent book : Graf Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen , including the Vo@@ g@@ tei , &quot; Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
according to the wording of the certificate stood on the Tum@@ linger Berg except the lonely parish church also a splendid farm that belonged to the church or the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ ja and not the other way round .
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that are now still visible in the local picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the splendid settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ right was created from the early medieval pub .
&quot; a Lord , who built a church , stat@@ ed and occupied with a pastor , continued the owner of this church and was able to inher@@ it the church too . &quot;
associated with it was the right to use a pastor or to propose a new pastor .
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the biggest of the two crum@@ bs at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created Glo@@ cke was first presented in 16@@ 92 , but had to be handed over to the end of the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows and the bel@@ fry were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .
in 17@@ 96 French troops in the vicinity of the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church @-@ chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the Church dro@@ wned 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ my Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead made of hear@@ ings .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m could be stand .
in the New Year of 18@@ 34 a storm dra@@ gged the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and half rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent an evil , the tower became abandoned . &quot;
only the existing tower @-@ value today remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history .
today Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; Schaff@@ dence Rent@@ als &quot; as successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn is the Hil@@ arius plant .
&quot; as an organis@@ er the friends and sponsors invite those tum@@ ours on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth Seren@@ ade on the old cemetery on the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler @-@ Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .
place of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann talks the conclu@@ ding word .
the program starts at 16.@@ 30 PM .
entry is from 15 : 30 PM .
&quot; to end the Seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , &quot; the organis@@ ers present the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade only takes place in dry weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters to preserve the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for turmoil and hear@@ ings . &quot;
the friends and Pat@@ rons Tum@@ lin@@ gens feel particularly committed to the homeland care as Seren@@ ade organizer Walter Martin@@ i .
association wants to be checked by Win@@ ds
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim dri@@ lls &quot; &quot; does not see a legal condition for the construction and therefore has turned towards the Council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim dri@@ lls &quot; has prompted governor of Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to increase its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal whether it is illegal .
the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to swal@@ lows a wind@@ force concentration zone .
&quot; within this concentration of concentration , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , at the same time the concentration zone at the same time means a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; saving &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; a few days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided to change a second wind turbine zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but which had not approved the district government Düsseldorf , because of a mould . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of plan@@ ing legal condition , the authorized authorization is still illegal , and therefore again to increase , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
up @-@ to @-@ date news of things : the city council has once decided to re@@ construct the wind@@ centr@@ ist zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; a permit from the District government is still pending .
&quot; note : &quot; &quot; in this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letters have been reported last week by circle Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle makes it the reason to re@@ consider the matter once more .
but they are not likely to do that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; looking at the administrative court procedure , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself in content with the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , is planning an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette build the construction of four to 200 meters high . &quot;
&quot; last year the company had participated in which the city quadru@@ ple was involved , P@@ ei@@ ghty contracts with the owner of approximately 65 hectares of large estates . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electric power needs to be covered by around 11 400 households - this is equivalent to approximately one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all quad@@ sen@@ er households . &quot;
the NE@@ W re intends to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sens Town entered a green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen and a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district of Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cras@@ hes together : woman dies at terrible accident
one de@@ terr@@ ent traffic accident took place on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Low and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was wounded .
two more people were easily injured .
the Landes@@ straße remained locked for hours .
&quot; according to police statements , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the frame of accompanying travel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as an accompanying person the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and distributors plan &quot; Home @-@ Shopp@@ e &quot; weekend
bathroom Langen@@ sal@@ za@@ er and people from the region should discover the shopping opportunities in the city center in September .
&quot; the commercial court , and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the local residents to the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the leader of the profession , Christian King , announced , the &quot; &quot; home shopping mall &quot; &quot; will sensi@@ ti@@ ze the customers to sensi@@ tise , which offers the own town off the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekend market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are to present themselves with their training courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ at night shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action is not only for residents of the city and the surrounding region .
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als in the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the Ak@@ tions weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and commercial ren@@ ditions are co @-@ operate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Commerce .
&quot; with this , the commercial situation and the city follow another stage of the &quot; &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; to Brun@@ nen@@ fest with selling so@@ ff@@ in Sunday , talks with all business operators and hosts , to participate in active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers to Saturday and the reference to parking fees on this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re@@ opened again or again . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals could have lost the city center when buying from the glance .
&quot; in the end , everyone must contribute to in@@ vigor@@ ate the inner city - to the landlords , the factories all over the city and associations . &quot;
&quot; it was possible to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y on a network that had partly spread , had said the king in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , leader of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , that took part in the nationwide third &quot; home @-@ shop &quot; day , for the first time five Thur@@ in@@ gia cities . &quot;
&quot; besides bath Langen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and per@@ tin@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day sol@@ le &quot; for appreci@@ ating the local trade and promote its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says Stre@@ ets . &quot;
the action led by the Chamber of the Chamber of the Chamber and with many partners make it clear that every citizen can influence his direct and direct environment .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas gap in the school building . &quot;
new other people have been injured .
&quot; at a gas blast in the U.S. city Minneapolis , two people were killed and nine others have been injured , some of them are heavy . &quot;
according to the fire@@ fighters on Wednesday ( local time ) was still a vulnerable to critici@@ zed state .
a man died as a part of a school building at the explosion .
a first one was missing later also dead .
during the dead they were members of the school .
&quot; as an accident , the authorities suspected works at a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the holiday , only a few people stopped in the building of Minne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
Tr@@ ump put on per@@ pen@@ ed trans@@ cri@@ bed by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border wall
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ te by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and guides from Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January he called Tr@@ ump in a phone at the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to listen to , publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. President ha@@ sted him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the wall publicly . say , he said to him , &quot; &quot; This cannot tell you the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ lag , Mexico for the project . &quot;
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ te of his first stop with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA refugees trying to emigr@@ ated to Australia , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; bad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade , who proposed by the Government Obama , after having proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , having said Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; this is the most pleasing call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists run rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ he Ford Mercury drove by a group of viewers in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and r@@ ump@@ ted to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white rider was able to reach the bridge , a group of white men came up with guns to block its way . &quot;
the leader of the M@@ obs - a man middle aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train at its ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; brun@@ t the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams , the silence , as a young black man was torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this horrible scene , which was played on 22 July , was just a post . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck of &quot; Roger &quot; is thrown , almost all in the audience is very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Bürger@@ ri@@ ler has come back to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Club Kl@@ an in 1946 were recorded . &quot;
nobody was ever charged because of the murder .
&quot; it truly is in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in organising the post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; it is a strainer on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old member of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights .
&quot; it serves as a dramatic call for him as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community , that there was never wrong . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must obtain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot reach healing and reconciliation , until we get justice . &quot;
a judicial remedy lays out a beg@@ to@@ wel about the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI Ak@@ ten , who received from the N@@ BC news , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding graph@@ ers were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ e process . &quot;
but nobody was ever charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on foot since decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice made it possible for the first time in Georgia for the first time to aver@@ t their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice was based on the F@@ BI of the black Far@@ mp@@ ter Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ or in the city had been that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby she carried her not from her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white country owner , 600 dollars to liber@@ ate Mal@@ com from prison , so the F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they were then away from the prison , and the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge approached , I surrounded a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison who has prepared and arranged the mor@@ de , concludes by an F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a comb@@ o between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the mor@@ den , proo@@ fs , and the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is formulated even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a suff@@ rage for mass@@ acres , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; when you register and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
nearly a decade of Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual im@@ position of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de .
&quot; their representation is vivid , po@@ ignant and explained in a kind of deep racism that many believe in America is no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and yet more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that that is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ chen , because then we are confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build a relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest of the Black Sea - into a room and lu@@ sion@@ ed a well @-@ played overview of the piece started . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; for years he has played the role of the boss cl@@ ans , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the carp@@ enter , and pus@@ hes it , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n - he , disappeared from my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ dert the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs on lau@@ ghing .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I just don &apos;t believe that white people back then &apos; n --- he &apos; said .
&quot; yet , funny one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only need to meet the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
and that is exactly where energy moves in space to feel the discomfort .
&quot; everyone is busy doing this properly , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N word says , he says it sharp and with dessert . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and guides Bil@@ lie Holidays sad to speak &quot; &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks in every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators spreads and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only the road . &quot;
they have spent almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as depres@@ sing moisture when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ de has stayed a anec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you found on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de was found , the air feels sc@@ iss@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to get closer and insp@@ ect the cor@@ pse . &quot;
children ho@@ cken at their heads . register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per each other .
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , as wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks Gre@@ ene &apos;s amount - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch @-@ silk trail and wi@@ pe their tears away .
Brad@@ sha@@ w embr@@ aces Mar@@ bau@@ gh the man in the suit who played the cl@@ ans .
Nick Ras@@ cona um@@ ar@@ mt two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks into her arms together with the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks out with him .
&quot; it is ok , whis@@ per one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for a reason . &quot;
later the audience is composed of the actors for dinner together .
at a table ch@@ atting a white couple from Atlanta excited about the post @-@ position with a black pair that they have just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought about finding words which feeling the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who like yourself and who do that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what that really does with me let me believe that Lyn@@ n is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today she is called the police shooting . &quot;
in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks Hof at his table he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights .
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post@@ ures is inspir@@ ational in a certain way because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study its own history , whoever does not know his own story is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental works , Frank Cast@@ orf sets on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ e staging in front of gigantic , six @-@ storey backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the speed stage ( designed by Aleks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) , op@@ tionally shows a s@@ hab@@ by street corner of the L@@ aying and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ est and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from the GDR @-@ Times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes @-@ classic car , in which the Rhein@@ k@@ chter &apos;s more than rock sur@@ ls , or alternatively an i@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; stu@@ d oil cas@@ ks remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - that moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ k@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ame ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ieren as already in &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; k@@ ess they perform Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ ed@@ ren in Hollywood man@@ ier a body in the trunk and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious Ha@@ gen that surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weights .
brutal the scene when he sm@@ iles Sieg@@ fried .
later you have to believe in favor of Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; stor@@ my , Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who sh@@ ed@@ ged and explo@@ ded hands on Merkel &apos;s smoke . &quot;
&quot; great applause is available for the concert band , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the great heat back into real @-@ time leisure . &quot;
the performance was anticipated by Frank Cast@@ orf and his director .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a hilly pillar for himself over himself , there were five years later great j@@ ubil@@ ations , in which the single &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations were left . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ef@@ in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have a look forward to this .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has an understanding of what it has grown . &quot;
I draw a positive reset .
max . works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their Volun@@ te@@ er year .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I hel@@ ves here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at school for an open day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; you are now 26 years , so a late @-@ professional volunteer . &quot;
how does that come ?
quantity : I have made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering degree , let &apos;s say , successful . &quot;
&quot; for me , I have recognised that it is the wrong for me and I want to make something else to work with people . &quot;
and then I asked what do you do .
&quot; a social year , since there is an insight , since you can see how it is spot , in the focal point maybe too , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social semester .
&quot; I will study dual , do probably work in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne , a social working education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not unusual during the Volun@@ te@@ er service to have several different fields of application ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it feels probably always on where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible aspects of social work .
for me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the after@@ care centre . &quot;
for me that was exactly the right thing that has mat@@ ured me .
I could recognize my own strengths and see how it really runs .
differently than in the civil engineering degree ?
&quot; quantity : well , here it is not about to reck@@ on . &quot;
one always has other people in mind that have a very different story behind each other .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been caught up out of the family - one must always go into consideration . &quot;
very interesting .
and you did not have any touch @-@ kan@@ gar@@ oos ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .

&quot; a suicide bom@@ b@@ aker has attacked a military con@@ voy of Kab@@ ul , a soldiers of Nato and killed several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were injured and shared a statement by Nato .
&quot; according to the previous year , local reports died in the case of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , even three civilians . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that had taken in Afghanistan this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday there was a suicide bom@@ bed two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in an opinion of Nato is to take place the explosion on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army had been impro@@ vised by a &quot; of persons &quot; impro@@ vised explo@@ sives . &quot;
the statement states that all injured in a stable state will be in a stable state and treated in the U.S. military hospital at Bag@@ ram .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as a so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , there were at least 1.@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;

&quot; the violence under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump is considering the number of US troops to support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy , and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA is a decision to delay the Smo@@ g rule to K@@ pl@@ agues around
&quot; the US @-@ American environmental protection authority has a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration of Obama , which the states are obliged to conce@@ de the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was made a day after 15 states said the Agency due to the p@@ ac@@ claim . &quot;
&quot; EPA announced the decision to advance the decision called &quot; &quot; Oz@@ on@@ cology 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the Agency &apos;s commitment to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we respond to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ ill in a statement . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ ill had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the zone @-@ regulations in which parts of the country have to be measured in order to adhere to stric@@ ter aircraft standards , to delay in stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , was filed on Tuesday and said that the effort is illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has attempted to return a broad range of environmental regulations that former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth , according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the reserves of Democrats and reserves to worry about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA tells that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pul@@ mon@@ ary function , &quot; as for example as@@ thma . &quot;
community @-@ der@@ at wants Community storage
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two oppos@@ ites the com@@ der@@ ate of flu@@ ff winds up the establishment of a communal area in the future home living facility . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; while still , it will still take up until now the church belonging to the church belonging to the church community , but now there is no planning stage for the project from a private investor to a st@@ em@@ itter project . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , there is a discussion regarding a communal space . &quot;
&quot; one of the two investors , who are still in the boat , has offered to meet the community . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with at least 70 m ² of space available for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the common Council do not float before , such a common room is just not seen as a meeting place for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ean housing but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itted café &quot; &quot; took the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision by providing funds for the current household has already been decided in the last autumn , due to funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is situated in the refurb@@ ishment area .
&quot; the establishment of a communal area would be , as reported T@@ j@@ ads , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed suggestion sees to sign@@ alize the investor that in this regard , he doesn &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ lets between the legs - as well as P@@ ult@@ d@@ ach , which makes it reduced to the ambient height and construction of economic power - as possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , this is not only Wil@@ fred sole , be this supplement . &quot;
when it helps : unanimously happens he &apos;s body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings , with which one does not come forward with that , for this one is now looking at the common room in the window , says it : &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
&quot; behind this , it provides a covered sub @-@ invention at any high level of net , or even foreign investors . &quot;
&quot; this is not so , because with the acquisition of the surface you do not give a grant , but get a real , in a doubt @-@ market place , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; at the request to meet the proposal of the proposal , there are three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in the original program , it remains the original program that Stefan H@@ all summar@@ ising the original program : &quot; &quot; when we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a giant gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; this was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactic , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;

in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in the Har@@ z building the first &quot; star@@ path &quot; is to be created .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary tour in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star@@ pf@@ ad &quot; &quot; comes to the information of many har@@ s@@ visitors , it was called . &quot;
&quot; he establishes nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up along the planned route and inform them about stars and constell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; well at@@ tainable installations &quot; &quot; plans to reach five to six places &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the tablets should be supple@@ mented by Internet .
&quot; therefore , in the selection of a choice of choice , a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
&quot; accessibility is a criterion . &quot;
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train will be extended by train .
&quot; on the star@@ pf@@ ad the viewer experienced a lot of knowledge value , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars had different colors or why a star would have more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is much farther away . &quot;
I will also be conve@@ yed to which constellation can be found in a chosen star and when he &apos;s best to see .
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mountain village of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , which is the highest star observatory in Northern Germany since 2014 . &quot;
the location right in the middle of the Har@@ z park is according to data protection for the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with a naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; in the university city , since 2003 there has been on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen , something similar to the planned star@@ vation - the planetary path . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary way leads up to the Hain@@ berg and the observatory - as well as an &quot; extrater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the St@@ elen with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf @-@ resistant Plu@@ to at the end point - are accurately positioned at intervals and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ unk so on a sphere of 6.5 mm in diameter , while the approximately 75 meters away the sun is 70 cen@@ tim@@ etres away . &quot;
the entire distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , foot@@ ers need a good hour to the soul with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestrian are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern would still last a half year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time discussing a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , which should stand in a collision course to staged the most thrilling box@@ battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the rude World Bo@@ xing Council body Champion , the hallway down to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ fe@@ ather Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory over the former four @-@ seals World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How do you go Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the pair used for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as that a possible show@@ down between fighters would be the &quot; perfect size order &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen to bronze &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I would like to run down on light weight .
and he must move to Lei@@ cht@@ wei@@ ler &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this demand the fans .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko agreed to .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Klim@@ as asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy to arrange Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year , in order to arrange a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight contest in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans asked for him , &quot; said Gar@@ cia and pressed themselves later to fight with the network , which offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other name can create this kind of attention .
when they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he cher@@ ish Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous warri@@ ors &quot; and he may possibly take part in his Saturday fight .
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he think the three @-@ battle champion from River@@ side look very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you did indeed find the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , the focus is to show stroke , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; they said they could feel the momentum , which he built for his own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the battle , which must be performed . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said : &quot; I waited for the top fighters and that &apos;s Mi@@ key .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured to tire T@@ s@@ zer
&quot; for an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the first information , the driver of an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira lost shortly before the termination of the market , probably after a tire @-@ placed control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car sh@@ alled to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he turned out , and then stayed on the roof in the green belt . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured during the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the b@@ ail@@ ment service , the A@@ 7 was locked towards north for about an hour , then the traffic on the left lane could pass by the accident place . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener against Braunschwei@@ g , that the optimization of the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points brings . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , we would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschwei@@ g . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we must adjust even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the def@@ ender of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the three @-@ chain can also be further optimized .
and a gate after a fri@@ ght the continuance is no longer cat@@ chy .
for the future it will be that no more next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) puts itself on the line .
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will better cope with the experiences in preparation with the triple chain , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ture chain . &quot;
&quot; I do not yet know how to act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his coach Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is his cause for sure , &quot; because we are just in the three @-@ positions at Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; it is a prerequisite , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ic and we do not make up so many mistakes in the building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if one cannot speak after a mis@@ sal start , does not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly talk of a decent season . &quot;
that is why his coach wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start of the season show I only after six to eight days , &quot; Fried@@ hel@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be abor@@ ted prematurely because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that players from Au@@ e might be even something fresh , since they could not have he@@ avier and complete play such as Fort@@ una in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the Interior of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; while guests from the Rhin@@ eland go as an easy favorite on Sunday , at last ( almost ) finished in the stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we take them away , only because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ d@@ nonsense , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance at only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games is quite positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the second Bundesliga , which one must hit from the outset , &quot; says Fort@@ un@@ as Chief coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be over@@ hau@@ led , arrogan@@ t and Hebrew . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el will not want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority of for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzles medic@@ in@@ al@@ res@@ et ) has started implementing the tests last year .
&quot; they should make the assessment of the age more precisely during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( migr@@ ations ) was critici@@ zed because of errors in assessing the proper age of some refugees . &quot;
&quot; until today , it has been sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the middle of March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency were evaluated that the person &quot; may be 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age .
tests are conducted only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistent during the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see a big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases where the person has been judged over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers has to be over his age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases that suggest that the check@@ up person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ zes the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly told that it will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , made with x @-@ rays of wisdom and MR@@ I photographs of knee arthritis , which then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas too . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus des Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they were sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uns@@ afe .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk , a child as an adult is un@@ correct to assess . &quot;
&quot; the largest risk is in it if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of Land@@ Strait 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of heavy loads on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was installed . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it is running great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold E@@ asi@@ ly , builder at the department of road and traffic in the governing board of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the work began simultaneously on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is scheduled for October and L@@ asi@@ ly is safe to ensure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
it is a v@@ ault bridge which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4.@@ 80 meters .
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance to Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the north side of Lau@@ ter@@ bach , on the north side , has a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called br@@ ück@@ cap . &quot;
&quot; this is a boundary , which is also used as operating route . &quot;
on Friday the southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday a 2.8 meters wide bridge cap .
then the pedestrian way should go .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about production , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bracel@@ ets .
particular finger@@ tips has made the set of cables by the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a fiber cable that many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand paper about the project .
&quot; in addition , first fish and cra@@ w@@ fish had to be fired . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between building construction and the collective @-@ stop in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on Lau@@ ter@@ bacher &apos;s entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully closed . &quot;
the cost of the three brid@@ ging rates amounts to 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : colorful protest at German mas@@ hed potato
&quot; it does not happen so often that parties go to pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ for@@ ) , everything else is difficult to bring among a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ WG , F@@ WG , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows on that day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell &apos;@@ invites to &quot; &quot; big electoral campa@@ igning &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - as Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top @-@ ruling party for the Federal Republic election on September 24 , and the Deputy Chairman of the Beat@@ rix director of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ gers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city was planned under the slogan &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now takes place in the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and therefore directly in front of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself here .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great as many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ for@@ en@@ los &quot; , &quot; says the woman who has brought him . &quot;
&quot; the police has led many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , it shows presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how does the Af@@ D have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ es reported by the Af@@ D volcanoes on the other hand he tries to make such an event and get the surcharge .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation , because of the already built @-@ in Laur@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ mes , there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ es is pleased that &quot; we have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; with a view of the event on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ or@@ platz , he says , &quot; This is the good right of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does it : on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ an is a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle various speakers , including the Rhine @-@ pf@@ alz @-@ president Uwe Young . &quot;

&quot; the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is also short to 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;

tro@@ mb@@ one meets the trumpet
&quot; listening to the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ists Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the Kloster@@ kirche . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Schwarz@@ meer &quot; &quot; and even &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ vis &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
&quot; both sol@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and should win Sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in European top orches@@ tras . &quot;
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire to cross not only the borders on their instruments , but also merge the limits of different genres . &quot;
&quot; it sounds like Johann Sebastian Bach on the two like in a new gar@@ b , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music &quot; unites with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ ener N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classical , jazz and the free play into an intrigu@@ ing overall building . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed in the spring with ri@@ esi@@ ologic success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has written it for the two musicians and even more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with its particular acousti@@ cs will be aware of the concert .
Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart speaks about their bis@@ ex@@ ual .
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try all things , &quot; &quot; says Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart quite openly about their bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; when I get in grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh , that was cool , what comes the next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably most well @-@ known relationship of Hol@@ ly@@ on@@ stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wilight &quot; -@@ colleagues Robert Patt@@ in@@ son , who ultimately was bitter . &quot;
&quot; in spite of all this ass@@ ures the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar , &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously engaged in everyone , whom I did . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten had to say that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual , &quot; I have always lived in du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot;
so it has never been be@@ wil@@ dered or obstruc@@ ted me .
&quot; I didn &apos;t like it to be taken seriously , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; especially among them , they suffered according to &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school time when she would rather like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been very hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven , I told me the children , I would look like a bug . &quot;
I really felt attacked and scar@@ ed .
&quot; now I look back and I think , &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public she doesn &apos;t like to live her love life : &quot; people expect you to take you in a certain way and that is anno@@ yed me .
&quot; and maybe I call me some un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like it to be justified myself before the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday morning at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have come from myself , &quot; &quot; said governor Justice . &quot;
today I will tell you with many prayers and lots of thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia . I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor .
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; said Justice . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump was promised before a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia Rall@@ ye .
Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not approve the democratic candidate of Hill@@ ary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was chosen in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes notes that he possesses coal mines in five states and inherited a coal @-@ store from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; meanwhile , the Republi@@ can National Committee on Thursday morning gave a statement in which it said , &quot; The Party change of Governor Justice is another blow to a democr@@ ati@@ cal party that would give us more to it than to work toward our country . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ors and the control of the least legal bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is unable to find a positive , inclusive message , &quot; said the R@@ NC @-@ president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in a statement by the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ gically &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; worldwide Chief of Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised by Sebastian Co@@ e , praised what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated , it is not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
Russia Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics leader Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Congress in the eve of the athle@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , I am sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes , who were cut away from competitions &quot; gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress was responsible for maintaining the Forbidden , which was posted in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found references to state @-@ funded D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the whole Council and the whole Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has realized in itself , that they have experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to make sure that the Federation is re@@ arranged . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said he was &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything over the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the principle principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninete@@ en Russian athletes are starting with the athle@@ tics world Championships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday , that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for a replacement . &quot;
&quot; dru@@ g@@ tests are still inadequate and negoti@@ able trainers are still free , he said re@@ porters in London following a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral for in Mali cras@@ hed soldiers
&quot; at a funeral party in Northern Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1,000 people of the two have thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security measures .
&quot; to still un@@ explained , Secretary of Defense said nothing of the Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) . &quot;
&quot; she called the two round pilots , but as &quot; &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her specialist . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we dec@@ eive ourselves against this highest victim , which they have performed in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; stated her . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old staff of Nord@@ h@@ essen had come alive on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
her S@@ är@@ ge was transferred to Germany and accompanied by a ke@@ epers of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom St. Peter .
&quot; on lunch , only the members of the Church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral party began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
beneath them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general manager of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the grapes laid down ro@@ ses , the relatives were arm in arm to the senses . &quot;
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ es and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas .
&quot; Secretary of Defense of the Le@@ yen referred to as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; , &quot; and recorded in sales . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flight operation of the Fi@@ h@@ ub@@ bers Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar with and was one of the first six @-@ trained tiger @-@ pilots of his regim@@ ent .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent to which the soldiers belong , explained : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , then there could not have been mo@@ ist . &quot;
doubts at the UN Mission in Mali showed the Minister of the Le@@ yen not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance , &quot; &quot; for a country that we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral @-@ party the senses were brought out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr made no information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik is not wanting a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by his wife after his death . &quot;
the Royal House hosted the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish roy@@ spa@@ ar is set in the Dom@@ church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard was already created a coff@@ kop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it was further in the communication . &quot;
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik will bury , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik never had a flour out of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the throne of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ ens in 1972 he would be king to become king . &quot;
in 2016 he went retirement and also lays the title &quot; Prin@@ ted ma@@ hl . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted to see , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene b@@ by , leader of the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will be ultimately unclear .
&quot; but he did not have the intention to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; born Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ ard , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people have always been har@@ med , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ lu@@ sts instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and the call for this country had to be the reputation of soci@@ opoli@@ tical intellectuals , I could not hope for view . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be content with this position and not ashamed .
&quot; these were just two mistakes ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants to be swift re@@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; Nieder@@ n@@ sens Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red @-@ green government @-@ majority for a swift re@@ election of the country &apos;s day , but does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
he spoke out on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
previously the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green Members from her country group in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hannover lost its scarce majority in the Parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ west took their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election as 2018 in its constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel ( W@@ ü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; stated her on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ U fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his faction to them . &quot;
&quot; in this way CD@@ U and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the German @-@ Sax@@ on Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 . &quot;
so far the relationship was revers@@ ed .
the new country tag will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; Th@@ us@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government should now decide whether it could not rule over this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l believes it is essential that the day of land decides as quickly as possible , as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on Tuesday about their further action .
&quot; the state @-@ of @-@ site also sees the possibility that the governor @-@ day draws the confidence of the Prime Minister , and elect a successor . &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these options must be legally tested , &quot; said Th@@ us@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will be able to discuss all questions in silence , if they are legally informed . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ wes@@ ens step &quot; but a little bit cur@@ ated .
the political leader himself says : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a b@@ aker of black @-@ green .
the Greens called for the decl@@ ining members to return their land day .
&quot; we do of course assume that she has received her country tag@@ on that has received her over the green state list , shared with immediate effect , &quot; shared the Met@@ a Jan@@ s@@ sen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests .
she deliberately decided to have no pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; even before the background that there was no matter of content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the passage of the German @-@ Sax@@ on Green @-@ Members El@@ ke T@@ west to CD@@ U as betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Federal Ministry of Social Democrats on Facebook on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; it supports the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , who can quickly choose the day to date . &quot;
the res@@ ignation of T@@ wes@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the political agency &quot; &quot; in her last van@@ ity and her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ atri@@ cal and tries to beat out these political capital .
&quot; Nieder@@ sach@@ sens CD@@ U @-@ fac@@ tional leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his members , El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast T@@ v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the Sunday election in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was at that time the SPD strongest force , SPD and Greens had a hau@@ led majority in the country , but a hau@@ led majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; agricultural Minister in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sies , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .
how was the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt . how can consumers protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
I can only encourage consumer inside and consumer to view the eggs in your refrigerator and review the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer site www.@@ gro@@ war@@ ds@@ .de , the Bundes@@ länder present the latest information on the affected egg @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; also , if after all we know at present , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
is now Al@@ di the best possible crisis reaction - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier of the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off immediately and since the announcement of Germany is in close contact with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; the trade fair has the same as the producers to ensure that the selling products are reduced and hygien@@ ically safe . &quot;
&quot; if at eggs of the back@@ stage content of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not access@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time not the establishments are to blame .
do production companies and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; after the current level of knowledge , the production companies do not have an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they must be due to mut@@ in@@ consequ@@ ential illegal practices of services companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little controllers in the harvest .
is it only missing on the staff or on the logical jurisdiction ?
there were just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth is also , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded from 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a consistent education of such events and the hand@@ over to the prosecution in the cases where crimes can occur , are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already told several times that I would expect a complete clarification from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m in food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to receive exclusively safe and safe food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food sector , consumer rights and consumer are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; through the frozen funds , manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food delivery . &quot;
it must be consistent on all levels and work with high pressure .
I expect from all the competent authorities that the atomic facts are quickly and incomplete .
how to impact control of football on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to prevent un@@ related issues of the European football club , Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain will not distur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , because the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to for@@ bid teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , which were launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G eventually has to prove that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar without major losses has been financed . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million $ ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s moving to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make sure the money loose , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar under@@ writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the help of the team through the energy @-@ rich mist@@ ress family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; associations may contact lots of money for the acquisition of players , but must be controlled with legitimate revenue streams , which allow them to play the Bre@@ ak @-@ Cover Point in their on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini for the UEF@@ A presidential election in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that associations , who had taken tremendous debts in their pursuit of success , effectively dec@@ eive , and ris@@ ki@@ cked to ruin , when banks or owners returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P declined from concentration to the debt of clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel demo@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch was originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - a club with potential and then invested heavily in order to build the crew and build a global brand - to a tougher matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year @-@ year @-@ period period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Pl@@ ini has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ mer@@ ade , his UEF@@ A successor Aleks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to be deter@@ red to deter@@ red from excessive expenses . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will be able to intensify the rules for the future , &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a Pau@@ line , it can distribute the amount for accounting for the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the resolution for the next five years can be paid in the amount of 4@@ 4,@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fin@@ es of 60 million euros ( at the time 82 million dollars ) , which later lowered to 20 million euros , and it was arranged that the team members took place for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players remains limited . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A is on the search for clubs that could try to pass on their financial supervision by giving their income through companies , which are associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a cat@@ astrop@@ hic company could count the PS@@ G if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be considered legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of the sponsor of P@@ SA was blo@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it has been reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar could be made on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup will become amb@@ ass@@ adors and a such maneu@@ ver for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators could easily be able to find out .
&quot; the sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more responsive , every attempt to consider the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no preparation talks with PS@@ G over Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , saying on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , since they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the last published reports indicate that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has generated a profit of more than 10 million euros in 2015 .
the accounts for the last financial year will still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expected that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrive a bo@@ on for Sponsor@@ ing De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly mistaken to see one of the best foot@@ ball@@ ers , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Weg@@ mer , by claiming that PS@@ G would inj@@ ure the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; financed dop@@ ing &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regards to Qatar &apos;s official owners . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose society is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a State that is financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owners and this has changed the entire landscape of football during the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect Finance Fair@@ play , because there are different ways or may have different interests if a country has such a big player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is searching for a new shock supplier
in the past years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board has made chocolate for Swiss .
&quot; now , the working @-@ operation is approaching a possible end : the airline writes the order new . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker in Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; North@@ western Switzerland &quot; of Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will resume a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would review every two to three years and are subjected to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
&quot; about 17 million small red @-@ white shock absor@@ bs up to 14 grams , split per year before landing at the passengers . &quot;
at the cost of Swiss Life the Swiss Life had no information .
&quot; industry si@@ ders appreciate the volume of orders in the &quot; &quot; northwest Switzerland &quot; &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important than once the advertising effect is : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants are there for the new tender , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to strive for a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring of 2018 . &quot;
for the S@@ DA was the largest Swiss chocolate producers not available for an opinion .
chocolate panels distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss completed a contract with Mig@@ ros &apos;s daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut was supplied in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the opportunity to place the logo , leading Swiss before two and a half years with the start of the collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , customers of the First Class with goodies from the Con@@ fis@@ erie jumps were pampered , in Business Class nas@@ cent passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i of Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ er @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch @-@ Kom@@ ö@@ der &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV show ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to larger things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and an em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
&quot; but as a franchise , it feels as if the time would be short . &quot;
&quot; first day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of its absurd hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for an attractive D@@ ous vegetable that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by playing on the core of the g@@ ags - actor @-@ aged men play dirty children , which are going to grow - made them still the im@@ possibility to get the final part of the wi@@ dows . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults who are now playing adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting principle , including a reef to the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ er years as &quot; The Hand That The Hand of That &apos;s the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point st@@ ö@@ bert a character by an Apple @-@ Power@@ book , some in@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from the year 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the gracious co@@ op ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy @-@ mali@@ cious P@@ lot , who is involved in the Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good idea by Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always are the Ex@@ courses of the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who is Matt D@@ illons Sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ sta@@ che of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ Man @-@ on Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; they are the moments of accidental del@@ usion that could be achieved this franchise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches this , what I will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; , &quot; the last scene to visit &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon now reminds on a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the revival of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even at &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West Ring@@ fight @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the kom@@ edy created by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka , with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director , with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , athe@@ ism and the path of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main rolls - a hard anoin@@ ted Greg@@ ory and a ide@@ alistic Io@@ z@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose di@@ alogs can be syn@@ ced by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a full producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags for watching ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV as Americans may do it with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - ensures a decent game &quot; Fin@@ de the voice out . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is deeply committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is involved - that it is often as a single . &quot;
&quot; for six long episodes , there are gone , and the com@@ edy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ ated to a lesser length , could provide his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re better , since Greg@@ ory and Io@@ z@@ sef always occupied the American Embassy , whose lobby always occupied by two thick men who disappeared a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the established communist public is that Western culture can do everything for food for a gel .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian Creator is not wrong : we even make it with our own recent history and with theirs .
blow against drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
police are a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning in the Schwar@@ zw@@ ald Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart have been searched for numerous objects like the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Constance on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 15 years , 15 compl@@ ain@@ ted at the age of 25 and 77 was arrested and issued in arrest warrant against them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the officials presented greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , guns and several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same swe@@ eps in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects there was German arrest warrant .
therefore the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 poli@@ c@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the members of the ma@@ fia will be organised drug criminal , severe violence , tried murder and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since the summer of 2016 , the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Constance had been determined against the organised drug @-@ trade in the South German region . &quot;
&quot; between the prosecution in Kon@@ stanz and Palermo , there was a br@@ isk exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the large use of the Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from the Palermo . &quot;
by the vision@@ aries of the investigations especially Italian citizenship related to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , at which early in the morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , is likely to go to the account of the gang . &quot;
way compl@@ ained large gaps in the foreig@@ ner @-@ register
&quot; data of citizens who should not appear &quot; &quot; : a report says that the foreig@@ ner tab shows considerable defects in Germany . &quot;
this lead to partly gra@@ vi@@ zing mis@@ steps in asylum procedures .
&quot; the draft for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen , has had attention to a media report according to large gaps in the country Central register . &quot;
&quot; shortcomings among the registered data could lead in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to partly gra@@ vi@@ zing mis@@ steps , &quot; warned in an analysis presented by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the register , the information is estimated to be ten million people with foreign citizenship , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU states . &quot;
the data will therefore be managed by approximately 600 foreigners authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been well received . &quot;
&quot; in cases , data from 1921 has been found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and actually no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can substantially slow down , &quot; the report says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in statistics on eradic@@ ation people , they are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by EU citizens who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; such false orders led however to a distorted debate on how to deal with extinction , &quot; &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun to res@@ hip refugee families with children under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they have traveled from there . &quot;
&quot; this is out of an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ er Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; regarding families with children - except infants and to@@ dd@@ lers - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , so the paper taking a reference to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin treaty , the EU is responsible for the refugees of the EU state . &quot;
&quot; if a migration travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the entry country . &quot;
&quot; for reason , the Office write : &quot; meanwhile the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families warran@@ ties .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) hold this ple@@ dges to sufficient .
other EU states would send it back to refugees in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the internally political speaker in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children dro@@ w due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of un@@ lawful conditions and a hazard to the child . &quot;
the second result achieved
a total of 220 lit@@ re of blood of living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach living persons provided the blood@@ shed for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were excellent on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gr@@ ule , who , with his now 100 don@@ ors , has now been 50 lit@@ res of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the church traditionally appreci@@ ates the assembly of a common willingness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is awesome how our body is laid out for it and we appl@@ aud the don@@ ators respect for their blood for strangers , even more un@@ selfish , &quot; underlined Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood don@@ ing helps several people , &quot; explained the conductor leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , as the ser@@ fs are broken into its components . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood don@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported from the promotions that are carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; &quot; said the DR@@ K cycles . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre from a few years ago has led to higher participants . &quot;
&quot; before that Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le , and Met@@ a conver@@ ters to the multi @-@ professional en@@ dar@@ s and were awarded for each 50 made blood don@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; half so many processed Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ ro@@ mmer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll , and Uwe Vet@@ ter ten times per 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation took over a rise . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; as they kept the interest rates on family members in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 to keep the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise , since the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly review , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 in 1.7 % and for 2018 to 1,6 % and warned that the pressure on the household income would continue , whereby inflation in autumn is likely to rise to just under 3 % . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years Z@@ inser@@ ts would be necessary to breed the inflation of Bre@@ xit and she said that the credit costs may increase in more than expected at the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut Con@@ trac@@ ets which was published a year after the Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will be time for finance , to provide financial support for banks , although said that it is expected to make 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on interest rate said the bank : &quot; &quot; in the central prognosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , since the pressure on the real income of households will continue to be charged . &quot;
&quot; in addition to interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain imp@@ unity of monetary policy will be required for cooling the inflation and a &quot; slightly larger &quot; extent than the markets . &quot;
&quot; today , the markets are being forecast for the first rise in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 . &quot;
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that elev@@ ations would be &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts for this and next year are projected in terms of 1.9 % and 1,7 % compared to the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year .
it has maintained its growth forecasts to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell upon this news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell at 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change is made , after the recent dis@@ appoint growth figures have risen up to 0.@@ 2 % in the previous quarter of 0.@@ 2 % , and GDP has risen to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth will likely be reduced by 0.@@ 3 % in the third quarter , although it is easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the youngest in@@ flow report offered little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by an increasing inflation and low paid balance , as the shar@@ pen@@ ing will first get worse before they get repaired . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the next few years cannot prevent the income of income , &quot; but she added that wages may recover at the end of their three @-@ year forecast &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , resulting in the weak pound weight , which is compensated for a part of the lower consumption expendi@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king &apos;s sin@@ ner . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until this will achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the final verdict of the Bank to the interest rates , the reputation was increased after a cement increase , since inflation increased pressure on hard pressed households , with three policy makers in July an increase to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; during the last month , inflation has fallen by 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.@@ 6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , the exceed@@ ance in relation to their goal of 2 % is &quot; completely &quot; to the weak pound . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; &quot; given the recent back@@ stage of S@@ wap R@@ ates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again since the l@@ ender is sil@@ ently looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market especially looks good for those in which the existing De@@ als run and the new mort@@ g@@ ages are closed , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) shall prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transforming &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ recurring prevention of prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the infectious risk of high risk cancer by approximately 86 percent , now by the healthcare service of a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Appe@@ als Court had confirmed the authority last year , after the N@@ HS had authority to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the chess being announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England leader Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) was described as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield are to be the first to allow the registration of people , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ ex@@ posi@@ tional prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a sequence of HIV preparations which are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduces HIV @-@ transmission to Inf@@ ection Screen .
taking Pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
those who come for treatment are gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics appropriate participants are identified , who agree with the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled due to anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people who live in England and registered with a household doctor can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will under@@ signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs during this week following an international competitive sourcing .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of the EP by submitting clinical evidence as it is applied in a large scale , and is implemented . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts towards preventing HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades sustained progress in coping with one of mankind &apos;s greatest health challenges .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; EP , if specifically targeted and endangered people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people , people with high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England have to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not with a negotiation with a partner that leads to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now lie on that the study is done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has left a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now as the Pr@@ EP test medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Shadow @-@ Health Minister , said : &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome to monthly delays and hesit@@ ant realization through the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transformed this drug as a part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is conducted as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and to contribute to the ending of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks did this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment transformed into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ kers with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court apartment . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne did not spare their pockets .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex at Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; I was looking for something , that was comparable to my prize . &quot;
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square footage was completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Jo@@ anne storage space and a mezz@@ anine add to the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; this was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms superior to one another , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to be creative thinking to solve the submission .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ works is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so that they were over@@ thrown over , without having to pick us up . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function or down . &quot;
this arrangement made it possible to place Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama .
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic cl@@ assy light window of Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us down over the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille illumination set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ r@@ ored to leave it longer . &quot;
in the kitchen the mir@@ r@@ oring feels like a window into another room .
at the entrance has mir@@ r@@ ored units space for all the bri@@ g@@ gles and glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; by the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folded kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went out there , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , fur@@ nit@@ ated M@@ DF door . &quot;
&quot; it is very important , so it is when you slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to win extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform one calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials which gives the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electric plu@@ gs in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased levels of square from something default in something quite different .
&quot; in fact , as Jo@@ anne , you could decide to leave this not . &quot;
brothers are fighting because of a 500 million US dollar imperial
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in an examination of one of the biggest property imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton @-@ Football @-@ Club &quot; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul . this has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business should be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to retreat from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have earned 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family was bought a shop in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co &apos;s family founded jeans and grew up to a chain of 160 retailers . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . bulk and shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with her late father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; &quot; main operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the family De Lu@@ tis - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a jurisdiction that means that Col@@ in property has worth $ 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; those of Col@@ in proposed resolutions have left him with what I held for the best properties , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed plac@@ ements took place the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now fight for control of existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; ar@@ gues ar@@ gues , this is not true , but raises Paul in front of managing some possessions of his compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says , he hope to put the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes , that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and both sides held in the Bar . &quot;
Ms. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants to run the milk bars and delic@@ acy transactions in the late 1950 @-@ 0s and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties .
&quot; you used the security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in the first je@@ wels of the family opened . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in says that he began to West@@ co , when he was in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their ownership to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me , that he never wanted the brothers to land before judgment , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claims that Mark paid 10 million dollars by leaving the company 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark are , so Paul &quot; says about the conditions of their financial division . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in has held very back , although he was a former AF@@ L manager and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire , the best friend of the TV stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and its attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can really not say much &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very sad , very sad that my brother Paul decided to mo@@ urn myself and to draw our family names through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote in writing to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end in our current dispute , &quot; he said and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be solved in the near future by the courts , &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
Tr@@ umps of New Staff is planning to restrict the media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
Poli@@ tico reports that the new staff head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of flow to President Tr@@ ump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more even@@ ly course .
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Staff President of the White House , who met his first working day with leading employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps White House , which he rep@@ lied : poor information that will get into the hands of the president . &quot;
&quot; Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence , because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to en@@ umer@@ ate Tr@@ ump by monitoring its medi@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps relationship to television dates back to decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed due to an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former electoral campa@@ igning Sam Nun@@ berg in February to Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote about the time that &quot; the key to hold tr@@ umps on Twitter &apos;s custom under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps &apos;s Twitter &quot; &quot; was ever &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
maybe this campaign officials know something that we don &apos;t know other - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more vill@@ i without their interventions .
&quot; we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets , the Tr@@ ump has not been sent . &quot;
&quot; when his staff made it a couple of times , they had to stick with him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; but no one has consistently prevented it consistently , that Tr@@ ump controversi@@ es prot@@ ru@@ gated . &quot;
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , which sets themselves from competitive parties , always try to move their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump material that may possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
Poli@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants who denoun@@ ce the President for strategic reasons .
this was an example that was described by Reporter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts , especially those with sh@@ ame@@ ful le@@ ak@@ age , and that he will find out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of mali@@ cious a printed copy of a article by Got@@ news@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy level rod in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be le@@ ak@@ in in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was ex@@ iled due to ra@@ ils from Twitter , or that he had no concrete evidence or that he vo@@ iced false accus@@ ations in the past , and re@@ vo@@ ke them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; added that the then Staff President Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the Tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive self , and its consultants are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched criminals get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the mi@@ tigation of the population will pray and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe are ma@@ iled this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards at dangerous crime on the run .
&quot; as the addresses of the requested sword @-@ bre@@ cher are not known as well , some references to the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol was reported on Friday from the action , which follows the &quot; &quot; Most Wan@@ ted &quot; &quot; calendar of winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences could have shown that many swe@@ eping on holiday destinations , it was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
21 post@@ cards have put together 21 post@@ cards for selected criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 there is the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ al , more than 2.5 million times the website has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online @-@ gest@@ ures could so far been arrested , at least 11 of them due to references to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est house@@ holders of the West Mid@@ lands are again standing again with some decisive travellers on the war @-@ foot , who negotiated a dit@@ ch from the municipality to re@@ claim a field in front of their men &apos;s homes . &quot;
&quot; the travellers have parked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy street of Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; million@@ aire @-@ row &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transportation , having been thrown out only in May , without being de@@ ported from one out of the Council to prevent their accidents . &quot;
&quot; the tactical group found a gap in the defense units , and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ ted to find a way . &quot;
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless be to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabitants said , &quot; They are pulled on Monday after it was sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they cast stones to the pas@@ sers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced to implement into action , because when dealing with the problem was useless . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , they were moved and they are back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably today even more . &quot;
she added : &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to handle them by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my burden , if the Council can &apos;t stop it once . &quot;
&quot; a inhabitants who doesn &apos;t want to be called , said , &quot; It is ridiculous , we just have only seen the last round of these travelers to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have raised this time and you even saw a horse in the parking area .
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a unauthorized camp on the country beyond Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can proceed as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our identification , it is very important that as many people call an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court needs to check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be opened on March 1st next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambience Works company will be lost up to 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights per year and also recei@@ pts by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , in view of dramatically rising numbers of refugees , were offered to the County , the hotel buildings offered the country office as collective accommodation , which was appointed for controversial discussions . &quot;
the town prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
at that time the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time .
but first of all Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ l &apos;s Upper @-@ master Julian Os@@ s@@ wald def@@ enses the hotel location and already talked about serious prospective buyers at the home .
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ isen@@ Hotels with business@@ man Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer , with seat in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former Hotel bir@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Men &apos;s Men .
&quot; you hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Birken@@ hof have been at the entrance for a longer time ago , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renov@@ ations will work . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been thrown out , blankets to part dis@@ built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black @-@ style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large heated showers , the entrance area is re@@ arranged , new window will be installed . &quot;
&quot; anything should be later &quot; &quot; beautiful bourgeois &quot; , &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer express . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece , &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , spa area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; one should not position itself at the high level of the hotel in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at an up@@ scale downtown , empha@@ sizes notes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up broadly , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual travelers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause it has already been guided so Sch@@ erer .
the ideas of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investments in demand , Thomas Sch@@ erer will not want to specify exactly . &quot;
&quot; under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; the outdoor installations are brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is publicly available from the restaurant , which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ aires : U.S. special event puts Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia @-@ affair around US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Robert Mu@@ eller will have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel was recorded during the past few weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; in vocation with the cause of trusted persons . &quot;
the paper announced the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded his investigation and intensified .
the sender CN@@ N reported it already first for@@ ges of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums in connection with a meeting between the m@@ umps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
us intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin since long have been specifically mixed into the presidential campaign in the presidential campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller examines whether there were differences between the m@@ umps of electoral team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are to stand up in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , Mu@@ eller also took more and more tr@@ umps on private and business environment under the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special race was moved personally to the center and seek the re@@ pro@@ ach , whether the President hin@@ ders the judiciary in the course of the affair . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand j@@ uries is to examine and decide on this evidence in possible distor@@ tions , and decide whether the indictment is to be charged . &quot;
Grand j@@ uries are therefore also referred to as counts .
mostly they are switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases .
the procedure always takes place behind closed doors .
&quot; the Panel can also be switched from the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office to invite people to det@@ achment under E@@ id . &quot;
according to the Sender CN@@ N already pre @-@ inv@@ itations were already exhibited for the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer .
people who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
besides Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also tr@@ umps of consultants and in @-@ law @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam@@ ar electoral manager Paul Man@@ a@@ fort at the interview .
&quot; right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts spoke on Thursday morning in U.S. television , that the de@@ composition show that Mu@@ eller does not let themselves be shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched off at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the composition of the Gre@@ mi@@ ums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations , and a new reason for president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the subject give the Democrats a way to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about that . &quot;
&quot; his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b declared in an opinion , he knows nothing of the suspension of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; but they usually work in the secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House advocate any measures , which accelerated the work of the special agent in &quot; fair &quot; mode . &quot;
the former F@@ BI Chief James Com@@ ey had said three times that not opposed to the President .
&quot; you have no reason to accept that something changed , it was on the explanation . &quot;
Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had been fired .
&quot; because of this kind of root , accus@@ ations were turned out loud by Tr@@ ump , he did not want to im@@ pe@@ de the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey said in June in front of a Senate committee , Tr@@ ump have asked him to investigate the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the president is under great pressure due to the investigation .
&quot; according to the representation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against the special staff and its employees . &quot;
the dissolved speculation about whether Tr@@ ump is dischar@@ ged mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special event of Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair around the later president Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired at the President of the Federal Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; several sen@@ ators of both parties want to bow to such a step . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic Sen@@ ators were re@@ pro@@ ached on Thursday before , after which the special event could not be dischar@@ ged so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg is driving in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has solved by the nearly seven @-@ sided size of Berlin from the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute of polar - and Maritime Research on Wednesday .
&quot; that is about Bil@@ lion tons heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers large Kol@@ oss driving now to the north and will probably have two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; it is with 175 kilometers in length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , one of the largest ic@@ eber@@ gs that have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to man from him .
&quot; to what extent of climate change has played a role in the decline of ice @-@ blood , it is unclear . &quot;
&quot; in total , however , it has been a series of unusual inter@@ rup@@ tions of ice r@@ ops in the region , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be linked to global warming . &quot;
the broken p@@ oss was so far a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms down to the sea and is fed by big gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this archipelago was the balance of wa@@ xing and abor@@ ting some years ago disturbed .
&quot; a full swing was sm@@ ashed from there , writes AW@@ I research , Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there are some things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , as the front can@@ did have never withdrawn so far as at present . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice @-@ top stand up with tension and could be sm@@ ashed if at a key@@ point is a piece of brake . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ e@@ berg does not increase the sea level , as it pus@@ hes water on the water and pus@@ hes ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of shame is that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in the low extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is after AW@@ I data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres and is the fourth most part of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; on the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks out regularly .
&quot; though it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; confirmed he too . &quot;
&quot; among scientists is controversial , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is will be back again or long run and possibly collap@@ sed , his colleague said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers fall back to climate change , this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg can not lead to climate change , so many Eis@@ sch@@ el@@ fe of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula are sm@@ ashed away in recent decades . &quot;
this long ornam@@ ental of the Antar@@ c@@ tica extends towards South America .
according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s .
the drop in temperature has contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have been heated in the past 50 years by around three degrees warmer and t@@ amed to the areas where the temperature is at the fastest growing .
CD@@ U wants to be Hau@@ star@@ if at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult to occupy free places , the CD@@ U is calling out to step out of the employer @-@ association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the Kre@@ ist@@ ag offers 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration sector in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot;
the teachers in the circle are apparently very popular .
around 6@@ 20 applications were noted for the places this year .
&quot; nevertheless , there is a lack of personnel in order to cope with the increasing requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 non @-@ occupied places at the Circle M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things doctors and engineers are searched for , as well as the forces of general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U would now like to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG to take the initiative and meet the skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; the administration is intended to develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development , according to the desire of the parties &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the aim is to cover not only short @-@ term needs of specialists , but forward @-@ looking for the application of the applicants , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards inside and outside , concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and involve a picture @-@ training , demand CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
it sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that one did not know earlier .
other towns promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is of a down@@ right &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ aged from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action is thus not even more staff@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; however , Klaus @-@ Dieter People , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint request with his party . &quot;
he had a long time ago in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he publicly asked the personnel fee and the other parties were aston@@ ished .
&quot; peoples want to be able to verify all the possibilities that enable res@@ ignation from the communal business association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution here , the roundabout with the trade unions should also remain in co @-@ operation with the circular cities - a door@@ step . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CD@@ U , to better pay the employees and officials to be better than the collective bar@@ gaining for the Public Service is actually fores@@ een . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , elev@@ ations or more money is only when you change to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in order to take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes &quot; law . &quot;
&quot; not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ dire@@ tor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to an NGO @-@ gy@@ b@@ ail@@ out
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they may not continue this , if they do not keep new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can work on , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities had sh@@ aded a boat of the German aid organization &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated the illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organization , which has only been in operation since one year , declined to make detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian pro@@ secutor &apos;s Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organisation in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can evaluate all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had watched the boat of &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that its occupation is hose @-@ boot migrants on board , which can be delivered to them directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gler can drive away so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such coincidence , only 1,3 miles before the Libyan coast took place , according to the pro@@ secutor of the pro@@ secutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , over the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the life@@ jacket in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not monitored by any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must first have an Italian police officer who supervis@@ es their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations , have so far been declared to hold themselves to the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , since they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or disability &quot; of their li@@ b@@ ail@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ iti said , meanwhile , that the number of migrants arrived in Italy following the b@@ ail@@ out measures in Italy , which resulted in the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and the cooperation with the local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month about economic development initiatives , and with Tsch@@ ad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
Ascen@@ sions and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler Bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin &quot; out@@ posts &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the Nord@@ pf@@ alz region to enjoy four days of tri@@ als and sights . &quot;
there were three liber@@ ated guides available for this .
the apartment in the Wach@@ en@@ heim valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted in hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to Micha@@ el@@ ast@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; it followed lookout spots , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the Pf@@ alz forest and the above @-@ stream levels . &quot;
in between there have always been a longer break @-@ up for the long triumph@@ s .
on the second day there went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the festival &apos;s throw market .
&quot; again , view point to the viewpoint , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate An@@ gles . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude metres were said .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and rever@@ ting were welcome breaks . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim at@@ me@@ ten the bi@@ kers in the open @-@ air inhal@@ ing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
after 17@@ 3 km and almost 4@@ 500 meters the group had the pa@@ inters forest from its best side - sporty and culturally - met .
console instead of lawn - Bundesliga - gears up for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sport stars will be sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of struggling for wind and weather over the stadium ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long since become a serious business , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high passages . &quot;
&quot; this also recognized the first federal ga@@ des , which are increasingly being engaged in this area . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded a E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer play 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire all new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Board Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that on these train a number of clubs can still rise .
&quot; the next weekend , the World Cup FIFA World Cup organis@@ es FIFA in London the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven quali@@ fies . &quot;
even Robin D@@ utt provides great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ Trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen now advis@@ es an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that young people will continue to go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations are trying to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be far more often present on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Office to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; in the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League Of Le@@ gends , &quot; &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long as in normal sports , Li@@ gen established itself , in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in Asia , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but what is the right sport ?
for many people the idea is safe .
In@@ go F@@ seals has long been dealing with the question as well .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sports is a sport because it is com@@ peti@@ tive and many biological and physical reactions which you can also find in classic sport - for example increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there is cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only train on the console , but also train their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; F@@ rob@@ ous looks also problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is getting more and more a subject . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult for online play , and in the scene missing the structures of the classic sport . &quot;
the scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no cross @-@ cultural barriers . &quot;
a study of corporate consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , it has been 50 million euros to be implemented in Germany , mainly on advertising , sponsor@@ ing and major tournaments . &quot;
sales at 130 million are expected in three years .
against the nearly 2.2 billion euros of the Bundesliga .
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries to continue .
big markets are Asia and the USA where Ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez will take part in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actors Ashton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ competitions Uni@@ cr@@ n .
also in Europe things are doing some things .
&quot; introduced in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sports has been introduced as educational , says F@@ rob@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ first League clubs according to D@@ utt is now oblig@@ ated to set up an E @-@ Sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany &quot; &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Management Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times , it is no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about preserving the tradition of the organisation , but the company is to focus on the modern market at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; there , one cannot stick to that only when football remains everything , as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics to push Con@@ rad Roy for suicide .
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to currency . &quot;
Carter has been condemned in June due to di@@ ligent kill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ tr@@ acked .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter has been allowed to stay free up to vocation .
&quot; it had been confronted with a maximum of 20 years , but its legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy has suffered from a psych@@ ic illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red pants and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down@@ ward eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have been Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the lawyer of the court . &quot;
they ended his life in order to make their own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility over , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any repentance . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but carp@@ enter &apos;s lawyer said , it was a &quot; de@@ terr@@ ent fact that she is totally de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot;
&quot; but judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity or even their minds disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor las a statement by Ro@@ ys Mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is no day in which I don &apos;t mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I am dealing with everything . I try , despite all my sor@@ eness , that we will carry with us for eternity to be there for his sisters , is it in it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys S@@ ister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was tr@@ acked by the knowledge &quot; that she will never be able to participate in the wedding of their brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; no more this only person to have with which I have been together since my birth every day is a pain , which I will always remember with me for the rest of my life . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to put a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call on suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxid@@ ation in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case moved national attention to , after car@@ ving text statements revealed that they had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging you on , Spring of a building , cast yourself , I do not know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had been sent to his death during the two weeks before his death . &quot;
&quot; before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you have to do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy , and orda@@ ined that they should benefit by any press from the case . &quot;
the case has the legal opinion shared .
&quot; among the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , which was sentenced in 2007 because of the murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before it was released two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in Los Angeles Times comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua has allowed me to run the Audi Cup as captain was not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern supports the Con@@ fed Cup winner for a big season - Extra motivation fails .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ ber@@ me immediately , even if the extra clothing piece was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide at the second day of Audi C@@ ups of course , no Philipp L@@ ame and no Manuel Neu@@ er was to be seen , he made himself assigned to him with the arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria @-@ captain . &quot;
well the entry could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also indicate me so .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was born in the youth of youth , Deb@@ ate and just from vacation professionals to choose existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ rot is one of the most ende@@ aring to those , to whom you want to hold much , which you want to keep in the mood . &quot;
&quot; thus , who was chosen to compete the legacy of L@@ ame , can only use a small extra @-@ motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player to take on responsibility . &quot;
on Wednesday charged the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as mini @-@ L@@ ame over the box .
&quot; to the right behind , this is now its position , the white bin@@ des on the arm did its rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ me had made me in this position as the one who can take the rod even in the hands . &quot;
he gave instructions to ste@@ er the un@@ divided tro@@ upe .
he had the look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .
Vid@@ al with it to over@@ play his missing fitness ( fol@@ te hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil come out of the achievements of the Asia trip ( folding also only partly ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus did not fall out negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
this after all is very good .
&quot; alongside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both agi@@ aded sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm was often hard , in addition , the sweet@@ ness attempted to be successful in the season as a few times . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy felt that the result was not as we had hoped for .
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still living for the entrance , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy for example was not one or two , but certainly six or seven interviews . &quot;

&quot; at Bavaria , you just have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;

company satisfied with the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ian Minister : economy lo@@ gically Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; it is often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as an E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) nor economic ministries in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
&quot; this is reflected in more than one year , in which the new Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office . &quot;
chambers and companies from the region refer to T V @-@ request of a change in economic policy - and bl@@ am@@ ble at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ er Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke has been blocked . &quot;
the largest about @-@ face features Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the brid@@ ging of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now available at the top list of the country .
&quot; this year the ministry is hoping for a planning process , to 2021 the building should be right . &quot;
&quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays a role in the West &apos;s planning , which stands in the urgent need for the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the circuit in December 2020 , says Prime Minister Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees this a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er strives to pave the way from Wis@@ sing , while the wine is an Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost the sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser have an open ear for people who want to start their own company , lo@@ wers the Chamber . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees in the new Master @-@ Bonus an additional incentive for young apprenti@@ ces , says CEO Matthias S@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; provided an premium rate of 1000 euros for the constitu@@ ent master examination and 2,500 euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master education . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; at the planned road building , be quick facts to create , at the same time lack it out of the country on the necessary personnel , says Jan clock @-@ Head of the I@@ HK Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to set the Wis@@ ser in the country &apos;s mobility business , have so far been occupied at 29 positions . &quot;
the I@@ HK is calling for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U fraction Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the accounting , the country investment in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros in the preservation of inland roads as proposed . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us still expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the skilled workers in the region .
this is further the previous broad@@ band broad@@ band in the country .
in 2016 regional companies had only rated the network supply in an i@@ HK survey with the note 3.4 .
you compl@@ ained about cross @-@ end Internet connections and qu@@ arri@@ es .
&quot; in contrast , ex @-@ economic ministries in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits at the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group has left Lem@@ ke for April , to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where it turned into place after four months due to in@@ consistency . &quot;
&quot; Audi is supposed to change 3@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction . &quot;
&quot; a day before the announcement of Audi said BMW , that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Chair said , &quot; &quot; the company is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as a bicycle restrictions , &quot; and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to ban or limit . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the company as a recall .
European automobile manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however , the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are regarded as car@@ cin@@ o@@ gens and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of automobile manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ alization of the diesel vehicles are to be installed , take also what it makes difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being indicted for ignor@@ ing the powerful car @-@ firms and to ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices , which could regulate emissions when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others will be examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the Ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in Germany was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italians and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be brought to justice in the United States . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigation in Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi to have installed a system in order to cope with emissions regulation in Europe , and a request that was concentrated on the United States . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation might strain Volkswagen hard to load : the luxury car manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and laugh against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the best @-@ published cartoon carto@@ on@@ ists , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 records of the Argent@@ inian wind and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guillaume Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself as an artist for lucky cards - which was frustrated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 60s made a breakthrough : with the publication of his Carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found lots of fans .
again and again the artists of cities inspire .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the shooting Tower from Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning he is still sitting in the drawing . according to the drawing , it works almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , T @-@ shirts , puppets and watches are still finding their dro@@ pping figures worldwide . &quot;
for six years he also works on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; &quot; Crazy Island &quot; &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in its drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ um@@ ery as a counter@@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D @-@ film , which should be coming to the Kin@@ ol@@ in@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange to me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore it is more likely to put on the TV series , which , like its original names , wor@@ t@@ less produced . &quot;
lav@@ ender comes from Provence from climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; lav@@ ender is due to that of drought remin@@ ding conditions and because of diseases @-@ borne insects declined , which scientists and farmers trying to find solutions , great headaches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m , expert of the agricultural research institution CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; lav@@ ender in Provence is effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant has been exposed to the impacts of climate change in the early years , and in autumn a lot more . &quot;
this has effects on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small ornam@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that carries the d@@ warf @-@ calves , and with very dri@@ er weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil is not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very sought for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; instead of having a very long plant @-@ watches with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered , include a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of the ev@@ apor@@ ation from the ground , but also the circumc@@ ised of the plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties , which are resistant to drought . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce usually meet on Wed@@ nes@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and ceas@@ eless drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss , which feels more secure : they are supposed to take their children with the office , which were the target of an attack with gran@@ ates , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ al , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters , to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and abdom@@ inal cells . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected , at the salary list of the government or cart@@ els , a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest break from the violence , and while in the whole country the cor@@ p@@ ses are more frequent : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to in December 2012 took his position . 5@@ 89 are under Federal protection and so far there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter there is their publisher and their inspir@@ ator by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; his absence is felt deep , although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows its mid@@ finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; , &quot; T @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with spectac@@ les or its typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , its night@@ mar@@ es , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was built a Son@@ o @-@ Bundes@@ an@@ wald , in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murder that are connected with drug trafficking and organised crime each year , the mur@@ derer of journalists will rarely be brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a although it is un@@ tr@@ acked and although the terrain is now more tra@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know why , we do it all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot down , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; T@@ wel@@ fter River &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius took away in his car and damaged it near .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ours tend to wander freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the topic of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a each day someone else or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of inde@@ xed , two @-@ storey maus@@ ol@@ s of drugs called drugs , which are larger than many houses for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to murder .
&quot; first in February , the release of an interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ els in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , suspected gang@@ sters purchased each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez not to force , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , the country to its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate him that he would always be there .
&quot; he was working as an experienced re@@ porter in 2003 , when he joined with five colleagues for the establishment of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to operate journalism without pushing the noise issue , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it to publish hard ur@@ ging investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after the foundation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot @-@ Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it was . &quot;
he was voluntary to give that he was afraid .
&quot; I want to live further , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV in the last October . &quot;
you have to take the task of falling as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say , what happened before ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was able to flu@@ ff the friend , who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
you trust in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ abo , the bar across from the office , go there always sitting at the same table . &quot;
&quot; well , ask them , was his love for the routine of his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions regarding how they do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; you may not like it if you &apos;re dealing with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home@@ work and cross @-@ lanes , to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ compliance . &quot;
trust his own instinct .
&quot; if it smells , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier happens . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer considered in Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ ents , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the space where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two poli@@ c@@ emen were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a vi@@ ti@@ ered building in a mid @-@ storey building in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters were asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the poli@@ c@@ emen , who referred to the governor themselves as not trustworthy . &quot;
&quot; it is a few months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are de facto controlled . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has concentrated on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending that concentrated on the hometown of the Govern@@ ors .
&quot; and there was a group that held in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , one block from the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter sent out public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i @-@ govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ class cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the Reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went into a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months before , the reader had seen the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; earlier we had already knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to the murder of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists on behalf of the press . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez , a few signs and went in the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country journalists have become more strongly influenced by re@@ written in organized protests &quot; &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; &quot; on wal@@ k@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
this day the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Val@@ dez .
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez , the authorities , re@@ comp@@ ose journalists and bring them into account , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has asked about it since then , that it is again divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico will be surrounded by organised crime , by participating government officials and a similar society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ journalism &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug ban@@ kers , but also on command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media @-@ W@@ äch@@ s@@ group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials over the past year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you think because they would like that you dis@@ proportionate the mouth , &quot; &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the morality have a de@@ terr@@ ent effect .
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that allegedly was signed by Z@@ etas Kart@@ ell , &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer file and ear@@ phones lay next to their separated head .
some branches chose to close as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue on how to put El Man@@ ana by Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their directive in 2004 .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez had publicly directed to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial title on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want from us ?
some journalists have fled from their own states or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as clearly the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who were murdered together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay back and continue the work , there is a daily dance with risk @-@ related decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poet , indicates that the drug store scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico is going to hell , and so I became re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce sat in front of the office and drank beer , as at once all their phones began to be sum@@ mon@@ ed . &quot;
a series of shooting with band@@ reef and security guards in the vicinity of the swimming pool ma@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate how it was promised through a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the boarding @-@ on @-@ board , they published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ts close to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the poli@@ c@@ emen , the guards held to see if they were in readiness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid of all , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the massive portrait of the fallen Grün@@ ders of the newspaper , whose middle @-@ finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its traces . &quot;
&quot; how can you also only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when it was the same day when Javier was murdered , the tra@@ inee sought me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to devi@@ ate its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue even though a fri@@ ghtening .
researchers have found out that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even notice that his sk@@ ed skin of red@@ dish brown was - and they said they could have had something of a &quot; &quot; un@@ troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology &quot; described him as &quot; the bes@@ ter@@ ned din@@ os@@ aur@@ s who ever was found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ aur@@ s which lived in the middle of chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers , who describe it as &apos; really remarkable &apos; , stun@@ ned by &quot;
&quot; according to reports at National Ge@@ ographic , the equ@@ ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ vor@@ es is the most preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something of what was missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to see more precisely . &quot;
the fossil @-@ engineered from him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal inside the 2,500 pounds ( 1.@@ 100 kg ) heavy Erd@@ kl@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant @-@ fres@@ ser , although he is covered with arm@@ or and a changing tank , probably of meat eating din@@ os@@ aur@@ s is threatened . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age in order to hide themselves from predat@@ ors , and used an ab@@ out@@ ward ar@@ king that is used as an anti@@ d@@ osed , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million year old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ aur@@ s took the headlines in May and is now in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ ch@@ elli according to the Museum Techni@@ cian Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours since it carefully . &quot;
&quot; the ast@@ ounding maintenance of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the patterns , and the form of scales and arm@@ or over their bodies . &quot;
&quot; they discovered counter @-@ ref@@ usal , a widespread defensive method in animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ ref@@ usal is usual , the results are surprising , since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted from enough pressure by meat @-@ eating din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival fav@@ oured . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals , who use the counter @-@ change - think of deer , z@@ ebras or G@@ ür@@ k @-@ animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot , which sign@@ aled that this No@@ dos@@ aur@@ s was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s @-@ predat@@ ors of the Cre@@ t@@ ace@@ ous must have been &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in its sc@@ aling shows also that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r @-@ brown was brown .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including its consistent Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , was driven into a river and driven into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as southern Bohemia , today , and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this no@@ dos@@ aur@@ s is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with con@@ serving skin , but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal is maintained , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as same as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you do not need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you only have a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is in sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , who stood on two legs , the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , was hun@@ ted the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of some of its horri@@ fic ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ au@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tonnes he@@ avier monsters . &quot;
the scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was ens@@ hr@@ ined after death in the sea and was re@@ infected in mud .
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the lively din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is totally of the mu@@ zzle up to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weigh@@ ed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tops that ra@@ ked by his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ vor@@ es was shaken by the Western Canada , until a floo@@ ding river was flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater order of the din@@ osau@@ r did not keep his arm@@ or in an exquisite detail .
the hidden remn@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still b@@ umpy panels along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s .
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see , the more confusing it gets . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied resistance of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy panels that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right for@@ ef@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are pointed upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many injured
fierce accident on Thursday morning at the A@@ 8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , dates for a long time - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the Autobahn Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) have been injured on the late Thursday afternoon with a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
&quot; according to first data of the police were between 17.@@ 00 hrs between the connector , Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( country district Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storms of nearly 30 vehicles , including probably also trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there were no information about the exact number of injured . &quot;
&quot; it is too light to medium @-@ sized injury , said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher . &quot;
a great bu@@ zz@@ led to rescue vehicles was at the accident place .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the Munich city of Munich , there was a approximately ten kilometres long retreat . &quot;
&quot; like an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it came also on the counter @-@ car to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ fighters have noted the marks of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle , who are now able to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , there was a second accident on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ leasing . &quot;
there was a collision between a aut@@ otran@@ sm@@ itter and a passenger car .
a rescue @-@ helicopter was on the go to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeps .
or one is deep into his work and has just an ingeni@@ ous thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the creator and w@@ akes an uns@@ an@@ ft or irrit@@ ate the suspension of the work@@ flow .
drive control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the creator card control .
one simply confirms the mobile phone that you have taken its place and de@@ valued it to the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; comes the offer , wide we expand it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available at the beginning of next year on many other correspondence routes in Germany , &quot; said a train present@@ er . &quot;
&quot; convenience check @-@ in &quot; is called the train the ticket de@@ valuation without creator .
&quot; to use this , however , some requirements must be met : one needs a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already the most riders do .
&quot; you also have to have bought it over the app from the railway , the DB Navigator software , which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and finally you need a seating reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works : one rises in the train , calling for its ticket to &quot; My Tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the test customers then appears a button for the electronic de@@ valuation .
the migr@@ atory ladder get on their mobile devices a message that Dri@@ g@@ ast X is located on the train and taken the booked seat .
&quot; comes the train companion at the ticket control to square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already ent@@ less online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can still sleep , continue , silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway , one to use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; who would like to relaxed without ticket control by our train staff , check out the DB Navigator in a simple way . &quot;
&quot; this enables the passengers to create their travel time by train personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB Fern@@ s . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our staff have more time than today to address the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who is often driving railway , knows that besides delays and pas@@ siv@@ ated trains that belong to the largest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times you have , in any case , but one of the Mit@@ reis@@ enden does not require all the documents you need to de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the personnel ID or otherwise a document you have to pre@@ dict .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between migr@@ atory guides and drivers , which leads to poor mood in the part , or large space and delays in control of your own tickets and taking the activity at the end the time is taking care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart food .
further train numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked yet .
how a activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ?
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken until their core .
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis was born on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which she rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and there is still on the street , it was called there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly on its tim@@ eline .
&quot; the R@@ apper from the territory of St. Louis was here , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , was killed , live live . &quot;
&quot; he f@@ aded a picture of bro@@ wns le@@ blo@@ ous body , who was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; that is wild , &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she placed her cell phone to return later on evening to T@@ we@@ et over people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and by a man who claimed to be Bro@@ wns father who said a sign with the ins@@ cription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
they watched a live Fe@@ ed at which a poli@@ cem@@ an stood before a group of demonstrators with a bar@@ king dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that another poli@@ cem@@ an is his ri@@ f@@ le and crying , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; rec@@ alled Fer@@ rell &apos;s statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we got accustomed to and which we can typically call .
at this moment I felt sweat @-@ fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept .
you booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the movie from the age of 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and the protest , of love and loss , of strength and resistance , which consists of the viewpoint of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as a Fer@@ rell with her daughter , who carried a floral dress and a suitable crown , according to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation she had a lot of times before this morning &quot; about the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I &apos;ve taught you when black people have to fight for it , what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take them , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell later . &quot;
that which happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally have not experienced a bl@@ at@@ ant racism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was built into a Camp@@ site when activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets before and hal@@ ves them to pass on prot@@ esters .
it slowly began to accept a new type of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met during an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came from Fer@@ rell in mind : &quot; &quot; do you document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism is nourished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an said recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area who is known for his activ@@ ism by To@@ dest@@ ra@@ kt . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Bro@@ wns Er@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us . we talk , &quot; &quot; said Davis &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people will be presented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ells experience - to show that it is at the movement &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but to a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most obvious candidate in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets show &quot; &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ells life , how she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laugh@@ ed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I have understood that there must be certain vulner@@ ability in this work , and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ells history repeated history the role of black gay women in the wider black lives of lives . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ from Martin in 2012 have shaped the film &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in man@@ ag@@ erial positions have borne the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main load of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to remark , to notice that &quot; the movement is really kept by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; it is however , that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action &quot; that has been selected by the Fer@@ rell due to its identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok this energy out , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront , because in a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the cameras arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on long ago , but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway in a demonstration .
&quot; it describes the soci@@ opoli@@ tical atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : &quot; a mess . &quot;
&quot; however , she cl@@ auses on an vocals and she feels obliged to have her memory since three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we need to love and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; say the one to the bit gallery : &quot; &quot; that would be a dream &quot; &quot; ( Nicole Carnival ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; does not need a person &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ zen ) or simply plain : &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advocates assume that a gallery draws more customers into the city , of which the rest of the business will benefit , fear the opponents that then bleeding the pedestrian area . &quot;
&quot; added : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the peasant market hall is standing on the 13 direct market @-@ market products . &quot;
it will be the end of the construction work .
&quot; the gallery makers want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new building - in addition to Bed@@ a @-@ Square with possibility , for sitting outside . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying nearly weekly in the peasant market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women are always very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher we have discovered for us too .
we would like to appreciate that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; whether multi@@ plying in a market hall in the gallery , arrives at the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; this should probably not be low in the new project , but it is likely to be low . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; why shopping Palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ ents or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary . &quot;
there are already enough of this in our city .
one looks like many charging shops here are empty - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but here there is not even a decent weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly from the producer and is also very inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; as one sees , charging stores will be reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because the dor@@ ms are often not portable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special shops there is almost no more and what is left of it , will probably still disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farmers market during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit @-@ gallery will actually come . &quot;
&quot; or does it manage to distribute the spec@@ ter bit gallery before , all stores from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will simply not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , also needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but for a peasant @-@ market it will give thanks to the ins@@ ane @-@ heart@@ felt many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg is no place anymore .
&quot; when the farmers market hall is made , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
one suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which hang out almost un@@ remark@@ ably - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the Artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen tu@@ bs and hair@@ cuts that were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the cuts out of the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth , where the former intelligence @-@ Analy@@ st did a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after it publicly announced diplomatic messages about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2nd , is called A Be@@ coming resem@@ blan@@ ce ( A fitting similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was converted into technology , computer science , and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and rep@@ ell@@ ent dissi@@ dent , whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he was only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted from the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and from the 30 portraits , if also something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted in the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways they may be interpreted , and the inherent determin@@ ations of these interpre@@ tations - but also to the identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has been openly sentenced to the identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , including six violations of the pi@@ onage law , computer dec@@ eption and theft . &quot;
&quot; due to the prison , her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one photo - a bas@@ kets , black @-@ white self @-@ white , in which Mann@@ ing is obviously uncomfortable on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in@@ blonde per@@ fi@@ antly has been associated with which she was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
&quot; in it produced the artist portrait of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic arti@@ facts like cigarette mu@@ te and che@@ wing g@@ um , making the DNA extract from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when they received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; declared De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg with a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use were exchanged for un@@ equal bril@@ liance over the course of two years .
&quot; it was created even one of the &quot; &quot; Com@@ ic &quot; &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; who predicted a future in which President Chel@@ ation would be able to convert verdict and would be able to personally see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama actually took only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome type of happ@@ enings . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little woo@@ p and Star@@ ke , since Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ e@@ ful ways to fix the rigid divisions that he actually should fix further . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen from a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written on the artistic statement called Mann@@ ing with its over@@ sized signature , including the &quot; i &quot; in her family names ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name ) have been an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose basis is gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ wich of Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show the involvement of the 200 characters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological point , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people hopefully will take will take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell as many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition kept in an own room , is one side from the above mentioned com@@ ic No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she re@@ appears with a release @-@ el@@ ef@@ on in the hands of the discipl@@ in@@ ar@@ barracks of the United States such as King @-@ Kong .
&quot; if they write your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist who greet from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , when I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the com@@ ic book - but if they should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , of their own genom@@ ic simul@@ ations , which collap@@ sing like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , as everything was written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic com@@ partments were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of crowds , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed with Chelsea , like the movement , which was also hidden behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of the kill@@ ings
&quot; a national @-@ country hunting hunt has been underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which was sought after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injury . &quot;
on Monday for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warrant issued because of murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
one of the police Authority of Chicago publish collaborative warning @-@ system that the body was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials got a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injury to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was yet declared dead on the site of the event , and det@@ ectives the stit@@ ch as murder , while the police actively seeks after the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ ba has been an extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ing , the Vice President of the University of University , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self will now be evaluated in evaluated and exp@@ elled from the Bet@@ ter &apos;s campus to the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair , which is investigated by the competent authorities and the North@@ western University co@@ operates at this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ es . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and the Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and willing to help the U.S. investigation authorities in any way .
&quot; the statement added , that warm colleagues were shocked and want him to be . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he urge the susp@@ ects firmly to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have a vision of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate it , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building that had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said , it is unclear whether the incident has taken place on 27 July . &quot;
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ ba and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team from Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police currently works on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including any possible home incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada @-@ roadmap in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice ep@@ re@@ mi@@ er Mut@@ ko
&quot; the Russian vice @-@ re@@ mi@@ er Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said , it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) . &quot;
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; stated Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the map of the W@@ ada map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for re @-@ fixing of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and published recently on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he has nothing to give concern for Russia occasion . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria stated in the list criteria however firmly that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported findings by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , in Russian sport . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we lead the investigation because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has collap@@ sed . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there was no state programs , and we will not admit what does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words coinci@@ ded with those from Vit@@ aly S@@ mir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing Commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to the Russian sales place R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day S@@ mir@@ nov gave problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organisations , &quot; &quot; then added : &quot; &quot; we have repeatedly told that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; nobody has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; S@@ mir@@ nov added . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by the W@@ ada of conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , it has been allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General , Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be re @-@ employed . &quot;

start @-@ ups which will help your company will not be able to become the next u@@ ber
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up during your employees but the surveys do not work .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers do not mour@@ ned to the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is on the growing , to help companies find out how their staff feel . &quot;
&quot; due to the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measuring the employee &apos;s commitment , it allows companies to complete surveys , speci@@ ous groups and complaint hotline , and in some cases wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to handle managers and contact the Board of Directors directly . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools is used to measure employees . &quot;
Deli@@ ver said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel at G@@ lin@@ t in the three years .
&quot; in addition to the sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company looking at a glance which units have most discomfort and which managers have low support results - so that you can re@@ boot why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture , you will not have to be the next u@@ ber who has been published in Sk@@ and@@ ale , since a former employee has published a blog post in which those who have spoken to have punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business option . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value in 2020 , according to the Finance Technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize the company saw an increasing interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the u@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent company leaves custom @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , with the employees &quot;
&quot; and if the main business leaders are included , complaints directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , the founder and CEO of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that his staff treated badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can be costly consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers Flu@@ k@@ tu@@ ation and law@@ suits , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has been utilized for more than one year to make sure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to achieve their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company &apos;s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to track complaints from employees . &quot;
&quot; well , since the company Conver@@ cent advocates , can problems , which were previously sitting by executives , which were hidden in offices in cities or states - like discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or im@@ partial practitioners - faster and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the risk management group from Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment , law disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employees in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it lasted until the &quot; Social Media came to their right &quot; that companies realized you could not prevent their dirty laundry online . &quot;
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as service , and load the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and an opportunity , which finds the consent of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , which supports both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire v@@ entures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the entire capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ itz@@ ers won $ 10 million in November of Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , and brought all the funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are more expecting their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if men are happy to be in a company that their voices heard , and that work that you do , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience with Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ ting and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ oun@@ ces when their portfolio companies are running well . companies are running well if employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third promise to increase commitment and use of the employees , it &apos;s no wonder that you find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment to experts in the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of an enterprise do not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asks staff after your feedback , it may have an expectation that changes on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , these can dis@@ appointments and hired them . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must have prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in the Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company to very much on gathering data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow employees , &quot; &quot; Do you really hear me ? &quot;
do you take care of it ?
and whom you don &apos;t care about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now performs monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after gathering feedback from frustrated staff , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; on Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about the staff , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ges
it &apos;s going to be around 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ CL@@ A foot@@ ball@@ ers are talking on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have moved their tri@@ b@@ outs and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training .
for a good part of the team these un@@ active minutes are a lunch break .
&quot; players who are inscri@@ bed on the summer courses are returning to their audi@@ ts , will return after the three @-@ hour practice to their audi@@ ts before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the water@@ man Football Center . &quot;
&quot; that is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before Monday to Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has extended their days - at least until the finale on Friday . &quot;
therefore the first three trainings of U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 am to start to meet the already packed time zones of the player .
&quot; the compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the brood moved nearly one week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six play@@ times in wes@@ wood practice . &quot;
they should hold 18 exercises in the course of August 18 . before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude against Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he will add the regul@@ arity of the N@@ CA@@ A support , even if they add a further point to the busy routes of the player . &quot;
&quot; we place this enormous load three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they have it simply pressed , they plac@@ ements further , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really is great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , resulting in view of the clear waters of its fields from an adjacent parking space and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that has already been abandoned with pedest@@ al poles , which will be a protective net behind a door@@ way , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then adapt it to an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and of an exercise , it is quite a good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces at parking 8 .
&quot; we will do the best , with what we have . &quot;
I am not very worried about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to escal@@ ate facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit to fac@@ ul@@ ties of third parties and their findings under the original fee will display , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on its website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible counterf@@ eit feed@@ backs and to send them to fact @-@ audi@@ tor which may display results of the fact examination from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed as one of the main points for so @-@ called f@@ ake news , many of which believe they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereas the French voters were flooded with false stories in advance of the presidential elections in May and Germany if they don &apos;t manage to eradic@@ ate h@@ asser@@ ted post@@ ings like before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in English that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of the new facts review . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the realization , which stories from fac@@ t@@ apped third parties want to be challenged , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , product man@@ ag@@ erin for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook continues to be his feature to &quot; test &quot; in connection with the article &quot; and working on other changes to his news Fe@@ ed to reduce wrong news .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was to be seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a hiding track for Margaret T@@ hat@@ cher in 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cozy seat at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now on inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look on the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; says he we@@ ars . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos;@@ sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another , upcoming British artist - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he was unexpected . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b @-@ print on the side of a letter , which was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ 0s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ pressure ! &quot;
&quot; and letters increasingly smells of smoke , because back then one lit a fire for the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself would be . &quot;
&quot; ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so lucky with old Pap@@ ers is that he has been supported by the National Trust and Arts Council , and almost four months in a castle lived ( &quot; To be honest : &quot; &quot; it all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , to watch the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ stro@@ llers on the walls and the bottles , the centuries spent in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigr@@ ated through the grounds and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scap@@ es , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank a whis@@ key and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received only 2006 the full access when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the staff just started to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which aristocr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English emp@@ ires , maps , which represent what possessed : &quot; you could mean that country @-@ conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go his gear ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on a broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; who leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ ver who joined 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; knee &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the farm started in this area and I thought , an uprising was a good beginning . &quot;
perhaps the two are connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are rooted firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , who told the history of the Jesu@@ it , who hid the family Dar@@ rell for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented in the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell dating back to the 18th century , filled his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rhodes &apos;s favorite family from Scot@@ ney , &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be spe@@ edy , getting back debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell men solve their debt crises , making rich old women married - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking guys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ bin@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique typ@@ ing experiences . &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a Com@@ ic @-@ novel about E@@ sm@@ män@@ mä@@ ki behind himself , the terrain of a San@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which has since been re@@ claimed by nature since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau with Thursday ) . &quot;
yet until Thursday mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan .
at the end of August there should be a feast of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; ask the creators of the action since yesterday at the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really , write them on their previously released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that we were very comfortable to know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; in action it &apos;s going to be more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able difference . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other commun@@ es . &quot;
a medium five @-@ digit amount will be the city of Bad Honnef their new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
every year at the beginning of August advis@@ es in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) on pen@@ sion@@ ers and hon@@ ors in the officers .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting no longer took place in the building of the General Staff , as formerly but in the ministry of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; at the presidency of the Heads of State , the five Vice President of the Government , as well as the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; thus , civilians in the Y@@ as were in the over@@ number . &quot;
the government moves the breeding in the military .
&quot; General Manager Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , of the air forces and the nav@@ y were dropped . &quot;
since the last cou@@ p heads of Erdo@@ gan 16@@ 9 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als has been fired .
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees Erdo@@ gan as a wire pull of the coup . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who were directly involved in the coup attempt to be engaged in Ankara , this week is established in Ankara . &quot;
&quot; on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was referred to as &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; as he give him the opportunity to puri@@ fy the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan the army really handle ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; hur@@ ri@@ yet &quot; released an article entitled &quot; Un@@ hairy in the military headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in general Staff it concerns concerns because of an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , among other things , in the abolition of the head ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
the big cle@@ ann@@ in of the army and security forces goes on any way .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan by decree was another 7@@ 3@@ 95 citizen , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed that Erdo@@ gan the military t@@ amed .
the gener@@ als in former times are the actual masters of the country .
three times they lab@@ elled on appeal to their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of world @-@ worldly power .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 Erdo@@ gan has pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say that Erdo@@ gan is targeted at the Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; a specifically mentioned officer who sought after the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad for asylum , the Turkish army will be &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is doubt in the alliance according to the aci@@ di@@ ments of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he sees to lower the leg@@ acies of 50,000 to 50,000 a year , more stringent regulations for obtaining visa for a temporary work permits and limitations for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Re@@ public@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty that increase wages and billions of dollars for tax@@ payers , and will do so by the US to change the way citizens from other countries Green Cards will be issued . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain @-@ migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that our economy will come to good , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to move route for racing at the race
over the past few months over the future of the race sh@@ utt@@ les has declined - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
&quot; before the end of the year , at the mar@@ ginal track , on which the tourist road drives , will be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the future of the race utt@@ les on the long run , it is intended to begin on the track according to the transport Ministry . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and san@@ itation the track Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ au@@ g , the country is most important for tourism , &quot; &quot; declared traffic secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; the cost of over@@ hau@@ ling the distance is about 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ take 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future of the country , will be finally coordinated , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the south @-@ native railway as a operator agree on the technical details already .
&quot; thus the timetable , the vehicles and the quality standards are tra@@ ded , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway society will be closed for a period of eleven years .
this makes the racing car shuttle to be ordered in December 2017 .
the racing car shuttle is one of the most popular rail link between railway stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; over the past few months , it has been tested in the course of a pilot business whether the route is used by sufficient many people to order to order it in the future . &quot;
the circuit is also in parts heavily b@@ aff@@ able .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should not worry
&quot; just as you thought it may not be crazy , a new report about technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , em@@ eri@@ ed professor for robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye @-@ colour of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them more often more often , &quot; said Mr. Shar@@ key in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ds have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robot with a sili@@ cone that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs , &quot; and doing everything from the eye of the robot about the form of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it will be even more disturbing , since many robots possess the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would be a Step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen developed to robots with a si@@ licate skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that can be appealing , such as relap@@ ses . &quot;
and then there is still the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which conve@@ ys the impression of relap@@ ses and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality .
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; &quot; war@@ ms the site of True One . &quot;
&quot; so may they like what you like , and they don &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; in mood &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot@@ ic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the under@@ whel@@ ming female properties , the play@@ es on rape , if one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( is called here : with@@ drawing ) Far@@ rah only , be@@ ad@@ fast@@ ly one of the most . &quot;
on his website True Com@@ ion Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy using a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men do not have Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex . &quot;
&quot; their origin and increasing sophistic@@ ation show something more dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as op@@ pressing en@@ core . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course have no sex robots , and while FR@@ R noted its rising popularity , they still remain provisional on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ av@@ ed out of the boundary zones , can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting , until the free market there is permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened , in which there is a president in the White House , who has pra@@ ising women sexually . &quot;
the de@@ terr@@ ent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos; ) are not the graphical images that dil@@ uted bodies and the extinct eyes but how realistic this vision works .
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible ( even with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
&quot; their builders want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate or simply go away from their companion .
&quot; they have no placement or a background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
in other words : they are counterf@@ eit slaves .
or to express it in the speech of 2017 : maid
how much power ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the term of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a bin@@ ary of the Tr@@ ump era , that the political divisions that pol@@ arized the US voters , also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Ern@@ t@@ ed@@ ank@@ fest there was newspapers in the US newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of dro@@ wn numbers .
we are all alleged to put all of us to burst our filter bub@@ bles .
less noticed is the power of m@@ umps to bring families together .
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousin , a centre @-@ oriented poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Re@@ public@@ ans in our family who has visited me this week in New York . &quot;
they remembered that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which she fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and quite peculiar on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the shifting effect of his presidency has the power to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ ace@@ ful opportunity that our kittens will no longer come across . &quot;
&quot; there is however an still difficult long @-@ term scenario , in the Tr@@ ump re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; &quot; norm@@ alized &quot; &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of reason@@ abl@@ eness . &quot;
&quot; I find myself today by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ gical version of the re@@ pro@@ ach , the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement made ) - the two occur compared to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Republi@@ can only must be spiritually healthy to qualify as an in@@ estim@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ou@@ sel of Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ berg of New York &apos;s parking department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all clo@@ wns are cris@@ y and the animals are turning to look at full of fear about their own shoulders - most dark and climatic music conve@@ ys this in a remark@@ ably way . &quot;
&quot; so many monasteries of a town dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite a day after I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; the Central Park @-@ car@@ ou@@ sel is still a strange magical experience , since here two two year old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one was asked about it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before taking my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to score evaluation with a 15 % grat@@ u@@ ity - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what actually should be a neutral replacement , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was exc@@ usable , while I get tired of experience to submit my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us is transferred to the hospital in the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us has finally abandoned the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year he was transferred to the hospital for the treatment of cuts to hospital , which he suffered according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was condemned by murder after an appeal of pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first totalit@@ ari@@ anism .
he k@@ tete Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early morning of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 by using it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria in Pre@@ t@@ oria .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us asser@@ ted that he held his girlfriend for one night intru@@ der , who hid himself in the c@@ ab . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year imprisonment sentence of the Pist@@ ori@@ us appeal , by which they say it is too late . &quot;
&quot; the national law enforcement authority said that it will be up@@ lifted to the Supreme Court of Justice of South Africa , and the sentence could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs risk that his sentence increased to 15 years , when the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ er schools , the neighborhoods of pel@@ as@@ s@@ ler from F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the holidays and in the further education schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the hi@@ kers in future go to the g@@ ymnasium , four to the real school . &quot;
Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the civil House Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; as a symbol of the dis@@ mis@@ sal , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schu@@ macher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des for a young eagle who grows up in hen @-@ erhof , but then release into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end the m@@ unter@@ e Sch@@ ar led a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the hen @-@ erhof . &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to bro@@ o@@ ds from his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to make from him a chicken , struck himself , the eagle spread out on a high mountain his wings and s@@ cour@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the board of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the hen danced with the young people , the cylin@@ ders contributed to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ er Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the young is indeed different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but also belonging to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
they wished each quarter @-@ äs@@ s@@ ler that he feels in his new school .
&quot; it followed the acceptance of the colleagues , the former school leader Michael Müller , who is again jumping again with teaching @-@ g@@ äs@@ sen , and the parents representatives . &quot;
the cows time is now over , declared class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher . &quot;
&quot; they leave their pupils after two years of lessons very often , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the mountains . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students had a song of summer time and vacation time . &quot;
the children got great joy in the children .
eight first year are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested because of illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned in Greece because of illegal camps , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , in Si@@ th@@ onia , a group of illeg@@ ally arrested people was arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia , including the two Bulgarian soldiers . &quot;
on the same day they were released while an investigation is currently running .
the Foreign Ministry reported b@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated control of the free camps and place each one who is found to stay in a place who is not intended for this purpose , which is not intended for this purpose . &quot;
checks are continued during the whole season .
the ministry said that the court can hang on a sentence .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly is the software update takes place ?
do diesel drivers need to take part in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers can be seen in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel @-@ peak BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW group software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emission @-@ behavior of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE car Club Europe gives ratings :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles , the che@@ ering software , &quot; said An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
the retro@@ fit has arranged the multi @-@ operation ( KBA ) power station ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a fast implementation in the coming months , but not as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has communicated to write any person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection is due , it will be done in their context . &quot;
how long can the b@@ ail@@ ments come up in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
it depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary , the car manufacturers are acting upon the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the upgrade itself might take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming it could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE stands for the wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would re@@ move , so are S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
threatens a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where it is dro@@ wning . &quot;
there has so far been no impairment for older diesel until now .
the ACE is tra@@ verse with a sale yet to be seen .

we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker , goes in R@@ ent in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; however , the place is already written - appropriate applicants are rare . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker .
and the work still gives him great fun as he gives in the press talk .
&quot; he reports of varied , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , they mar@@ vel at the same time no application has sent the application profile . &quot;
the city is searching for the next time an architect or Bau@@ ingenie@@ ur .
so it is meant to be enough time considering the regular intervals of notice - there is still enough time for a review .
&quot; as Has@@ l@@ ach will be responsible for the administrative community as a sub @-@ law authority , the applicant must pre@@ dict@@ ate corresponding depar@@ tures . &quot;
for this function is intended to retain the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to complete them , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the closeness of the city and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reported by a good operating lim@@ a as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , &quot; he is confident about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but even in the future , varied projects on the agenda are the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the Lower @-@ car park . &quot;
the K@@ zi@@ g@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium is still subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike with around 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it &quot; , &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; designed for a Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker of great scope . &quot;
with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s its own tree and gar@@ dener can be responded to multi @-@ flexible reaction .
&quot; you can move a lot &quot; , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants will often be praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is known as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have an eye for it , what rein@@ cle@@ ars , &quot; when re@@ builds approved , the ex@@ cre@@ tion Stadt@@ bau@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is Bau@@ herr , &quot; in the end everything is running over my table . &quot;
&quot; for years of care and coordination , he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( deep @-@ construction ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wishes : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to inher@@ it Roland W@@ acker , according to the information of the city of Has@@ l@@ ach , should be presented as a diploma @-@ engineer or Bachelor with specialized architecture and have good professional knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law . &quot;
&quot; the municipal office under@@ lies high @-@ depth and deep @-@ construction , construction planning , sc@@ under@@ mining fields , management of municipal property , municipal business , with building and municipal office , including monuments protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : south@@ ward route locked
&quot; according to the police , the so far @-@ known perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway station in the field of the Le@@ ob@@ ener road ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ann@@ ul@@ ating freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male kill@@ ers and are looking for the night hours after them .
near the scene of witnesses a ros@@ ar@@ oter Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bicycle driver had been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ k coup , &quot; said Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch at the APA . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator would have brought itself into great danger and also threaten the train transport .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locom@@ otive and the plant , as well as the delay @-@ minutes and the cost of sliding on transport , you could also come to the perpetrators even from the train customers . &quot;
&quot; in total be excluded from a &quot; &quot; significant &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage had been fixed on Friday afternoon , rail traffic in the south @-@ lane could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten persons were fallen in Friday afternoon , two of them considered the long @-@ term traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains were not fallen out , but they were delayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ person Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged around 200 metres upper lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammation ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study maintains exactly the opposite : a diet , which is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and milk products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition that affects approximately 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300@@ ,000 , causes ga@@ stri@@ ls and pu@@ re@@ ations , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while the affected is usually to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells which promote a tolerant intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the gut pat@@ rol to ensure that damaging micro@@ bes that hide in the food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to em@@ ulate inflammation , are balanced by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far towards inflammation , it can result from a inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experiments has been found that a type of tolerance of tolerance is found in mice , which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ s . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the blocks of proteins - to em@@ ulate the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have a link between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice in their food had , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an an tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ rich diet tolerant tolerant , less infl@@ amed bo@@ wel bacteria , if the same system also wir@@ es with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance when it found out that a group of study bands had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was not separated . &quot;
&quot; they suspect that the difference had to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omes of the mice , the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ är@@ me of the mice , DNA sequ@@ en@@ cated and were found six species that were present in mice with the immune cells , but without fail at mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment so that they were lacking a intestinal micro@@ bial and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria re@@ acted to the immune system , the researchers were able to grow on the immune system , and then resulted in small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells that were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerant cells .
&quot; as the active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ ic@@ values were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan stated that people have the same tolerant cells , such as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gast@@ ro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ adren@@ al products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as with mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han@@ values can lead to an expansion of this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has ple@@ dged a &quot; genius . &quot;
&quot; at Manchester United , with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic a &quot; genius &quot; signed , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut on Wednesday evening his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 Million Po@@ signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the final pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the Hal@@ ter &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC was excluded from the preparation @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which was to improve M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him to be ready earlier than later .

&quot; the Independent was revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still had three additional liabilities , but he ins@@ isted that the club already made a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four prime ministers . &quot;
&quot; three from four to get , I would like to thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they get four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the American plane manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in the Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan , and moved to the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar schir@@ i the shape of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers was to be .
the whole was a trigger for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising before .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing &apos;s logo was painted into the sky .
&quot; new record for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; how the wind is spinning , however , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , looked &amp; D @-@ democratic Prime Minister before elections always with some concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no interference from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the covenant - was the most important desire of the electoral fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt Brandt @-@ House observe the events in the SPD @-@ governed national capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has received from there from the beginning of the year would not be described with head@@ winds .
there were deep stops .
and one after the other .
&quot; the new CD@@ U sees after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Greens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliably governed , &quot; said CD@@ U Secretary General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising frac@@ tion@@ ment of a Green Group has over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the Sunday election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ voice majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green President Michael Kellner has called on the ab@@ ant Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Green @-@ MP El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to return their mandate .
the crossing to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests must immediately return their mandate &quot; , &quot; said the German CEO and electoral campa@@ igning of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; but this must not be true , &quot; &quot; turned out an SPD member fighters , as on Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ f@@ laws reached the party central . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after crossing the green parliament@@ arians El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests to CD@@ U without their own governmental majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary culmin@@ ation of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD states .
and no one knows what is coming next .
the Mis@@ ere started with the unexpected strong defeat in the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , cal@@ med down the comrades . &quot;
after the parliamentary elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia everything will be different .
this became apparent then - and it all became much worse .
&quot; the SPD in Kiel brought the SPD to d@@ dan@@ gle , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute , the party smooth . &quot;
te@@ dious re@@ acted the comrades in the weeks afterwards .
then when they had gotten new courage he came to the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg .
and with him the next race came out .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD state , lost his Nim@@ bus in that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he did something wrong in crisis communication after that , what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for its political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
because of the VW exhau@@ st and its role in the Supervisory Board the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische Prime Minister has already been in criticism for a long time .
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps right now , Wei@@ l tried to increasingly become stronger in the federal government in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hannover , to develop his power in Berlin , remained hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz as well . &quot;
they let him grant him as they spoke of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , the Wei@@ l on the parties &apos; internal compul@@ sion is essentially no fault . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all at all .
&quot; sometimes , comrades try to hold their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed to the Greens , and here above all to the ab@@ ant parliament@@ arians of T@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and more democratic , as MS T@@ jack@@ ets puts their own careers on the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , chief of the party left in the SPD Member State , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Ms. T@@ jack@@ ets is not elected because of her person as direct can@@ did@@ atin , but on the national list of the German @-@ Sax@@ on Greens to the Parliament , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD Member State , compl@@ ained a &quot; &quot; democratic maneu@@ ver &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate before four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l for Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ s@@ ische SPD as a top candidate to the Federal election of the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now , the personal career progression of a future CD@@ U @-@ parliament@@ arians to the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann further . &quot;
he called for clarification of the ration@@ ale .
&quot; I want to know if more has been there , or there has been further commitments to the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen . &quot;
funding of the center of Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
&quot; who wants to be in the years , can soon get support from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representative St@@ eg urban development performed on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler gave once again a review on what happened so far . &quot;
since 1991 it has been in delicate san@@ itation .
&quot; at that time , in the refurb@@ ishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the allowance is still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote the internal development , and not only new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government of Govern@@ mental Karlsruhe received the information that it will give a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount was 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros of the country , the rest of the church received . &quot;
how does a re@@ development occur ?
&quot; you will , so Sch@@ in@@ dler continue to examine where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned territory ever interest , to san@@ ize . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory could then move again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty stood on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government @-@ program &quot; &quot; Social Town &quot; , &quot; as part of the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program are the re@@ vit@@ alisation of inner cities , the improvement of the residential and labour conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , that is called a plot . &quot;
the renovation area would eventually be defined as stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the inventory would be carried out once again , as part of those involved in the refurb@@ ishment area involved a questionnaire to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional record should be made possible , so that in the coming year with the renov@@ ations . &quot;
Pi@@ es@@ sch@@ mann explained that each Comm@@ une has to perform the said pre @-@ trial investigations .
&quot; it is therefore , to evaluate and decide to assess the city &apos;s problems and decide when gentle and to what extent . &quot;
there will be a san@@ itation in the basic book for the respective property .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will return once again and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionn@@ aires sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arc &quot; &quot; in which it is among other things about the construction state and the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living space . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; mode &quot; &quot; is only to fill out when in building business rooms are operated . &quot;
&quot; however , it is important to note that Got@@ zel showed that a fixed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , new measures are not con@@ du@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler still stressed that the distribution of funding after the &quot; &quot; Wind@@ ho@@ ist principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , ex@@ hor@@ ts first . &quot;
you could not reserve any support for later . &quot;
&quot; at the end , photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ k@@ ern II &quot; were shown to make the present a refurb@@ ishment &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
bri@@ tish inventor puts himself a micro@@ chip to come with a hand@@ shake in house and car
&quot; a bri@@ tish inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro chip so that he opens his door@@ step to enter his office and even start his car with a hand@@ shake . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and for@@ ef@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory officer in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , together to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and only takes 30 seconds .
&quot; the company from North@@ am also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for a surcharge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn to fly for an event that raises American production last month , costs tax@@ payers to the military , which were left to the TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the heart of the event was on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and executive officer of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter was placed in Connecticut , in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a for@@ k@@ lift truck from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the Military office of the White House demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter reached the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted to realize that you are aware of it because there is such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 wrote on the eve of the event his superi@@ ors , the Deputy naval manager for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn event for the event around 15 o &apos;clock , and so long , until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , due to the limitation of service hours a second team would require a return flight . &quot;
the initial flight was found during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel of unity remained at the ground during the time on the plane .
the records provided by the TI@@ ME were not clear whether ultimately a second flight exchange was required .
&quot; the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal government , public ownership for political purposes . &quot;
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the destination .
&quot; one question which we posed was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus for the reform of the healthcare reform that was going on in the Senate , and he served the efforts to susp@@ end government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the plane , known as Marine One or Air Force One , from politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for the journey .
&quot; however , their use only demand for a photo operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February when the presidential plane was in the background of his first campaign en@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential aircraft through its predec@@ essors . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; Made in America &quot; - the products from all 50 states are produced , produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew often lead workout flights in the area around Washington and South La@@ wn to aver@@ t the US President in the White House with precise centimeters .
&quot; as a tr@@ ump at the beginning of July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 in the White House was 58 exercise facilities . &quot;
&quot; the flight for &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event en@@ umer@@ ated in the training needs of the passenger for the month , said an official . &quot;
&quot; additionally , 11 hours on this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ voting commis@@ sions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden for none of the other re@@ qu@@ ites , which were presented at the event . &quot;
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in addressing the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not compens@@ ate for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to St@@ un@@ ent@@ ari@@ fen of the U.S. Defense Department for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D equipment for the v@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per flight . &quot;
record of unity explores the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the local base of the Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virg@@ ina .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ payers to set tax@@ payers on the basis of estimates for the equip@@ ments , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates contain staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 the revenue rates for DO@@ D does not include the personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contractual terms . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ reads , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ agna . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people are dependent on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly .
it is of course appropriate to emphasize that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ fighter account . &quot;
&quot; in the White House Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky , and rolled together with the media through his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will start tomorrow from 11 am in Kiel at the Tab@@ ellen@@ third Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V .
&quot; despite having five games still flawless , the leader of the second tennis Bundesliga has received the sense of reality . &quot;
teamwork Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially at the rear positions I find the team very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , especially the imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets on the Davis Cup .
&quot; and they are also strongly in the double , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view on Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Sweden ) , S@@ ör@@ en and Es@@ ben O@@ read , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen , and Andreas Bj@@ sex@@ hus ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; it will be as always hard for us .
you also need a good serving happiness . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high North stands practical .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump had not been happy when he set his signature under the law for the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his h@@ ast , to en@@ act the law , &quot; &quot; the Congress has packed a few &quot; constitutional rules &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels fo@@ aming against the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is to pun@@ ish European companies which help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors from domestic O@@ MV have been financed with other European companies to build the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership North Stream 2 with other European companies . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is tremendous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have had to bring sanctions even by executive order to life . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen which the Group could rep@@ el , and which could really do it hurt . &quot;

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen subsidies
the city organizes the K@@ ita @-@ lunch table itself again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and an assignment to the team .
in the city &apos;s Day@@ care the clock is turned back .
&quot; on 1 September , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in urban care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy director in the department of youth aid , is this good news : &quot; &quot; we all have been very happy . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , except home : a Cat@@ erer will continue to take over this task and delivers freshly cooked . &quot;
&quot; the city is located in the district areas 46 children &apos;s day , in 44 the children get to lunch time a warm meal . &quot;
&quot; in the past Kit@@ a@@ Year , there were 2@@ 800 children at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; now we eat not only children , which are served by 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay up to 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 Parti@@ cip@@ ants have been war@@ med down from 1 September kitchen service : you can warm up the angel@@ ic meals , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ate the meal individually , give the food out , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are firmly assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed units as well as seventh tro@@ op facilities - decides on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the chefs are now firm in the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much more involved and it is easier for the killing , pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
because that &apos;s why it is about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection to the kitchen force is there any sense .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen @-@ forces - will now be done by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen , it also has the charm that it turned out in the cost between self @-@ reg@@ ression and foreign currency for the city as the most economical one , it is out of the press ministry . &quot;
and that even though 46 participants are new .
&quot; but these hours fall at approximately 750 persons in the education area , not so strong in weight , &quot; &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ ance . &quot;

GM@@ B concern about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union would like to deal with managers of the Bis@@ ku@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie over the long @-@ term commitment to produce in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company has ou@@ tw@@ ei@@ gh the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , next to other products of Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea cookies . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union officials would be &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the B@@ alle@@ ite of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s to express concern that the funding for moderni@@ zation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can gain clarity about the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , concerns our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workers are strongly focused on local community and major Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantageous situation . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , the wage and prosperity , and against the background of Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently need a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ite at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland and the company will respond directly to this , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; we had a regular meeting with employees and GM@@ B representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the staff that we like all companies who are active in an extremely competitive and uns@@ afe business climate , our business is constantly checked - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; over the last years , we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as production facility and completely at home . if our operations should change at the site , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La League likes to rep@@ ent its interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave her persecution of £ 18@@ 9 million in their persecution , after submitting an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to redeem its free@@ wheel clause , but have warned Barcelona three years before the world empire ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has mel@@ ted the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record for more than one double the previous mark , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the past season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the end , Ne@@ ym@@ ar is used for the most expensive players in the world and for the highest paid professional athle@@ te of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way out outside , although a source is near the Catal@@ ans board , that the club has always given his best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association that wanted to sign up one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign in , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Mittel@@ feld Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they did not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report drafted by Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of waste de@@ fici@@ ent Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ used sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ er , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are the Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German press agency , he received from former Regen@@ sburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would understand their deep mis@@ sal about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; refers , on the contrary , critici@@ zed that in the coverage of violence at the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , with &quot; two levels &quot; measured . &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt no one that would have to be punished for &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful action , &quot; says the &quot; degree medi@@ al manipulation , &quot; the author of Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and a member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committees . &quot;
&quot; the habit of defining the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of the present experience and prepares public opinion to hold this for normal &quot; &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; also Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis argued in the interview with the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; we would like to go to the church , and that is a whis@@ per fres@@ co@@ es . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; bat had been a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; to be finished with friends , as I was one . &quot;
they f@@ alls it unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades because the world has changed .
&quot; in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse , the Pope Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often deaf . &quot;
&quot; wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder band &quot; My brother of Pope &apos; ( in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protecting , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment scientist Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were ab@@ used between 1945 and the early 1990s &quot; with high Pl@@ au@@ si@@ bilities &quot; victims of assault , 67 domin@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students was also severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims of R. estimates the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even unite positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; in an interview , Hes@@ emann , why the thesis report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger took up his opinion to be dischar@@ ged . &quot;
Mr Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence &quot; by the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; gives an contradic@@ tory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; to a lift many students take up its &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tionist , which was tangible in the oil , when a domain name musi@@ cally brought with no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : when you are doing the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself about why the name of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really occurs in it . &quot;
he is dedicated straight to eight sides and he is clearly acqu@@ itted from any suspicion of medi@@ a@@ ean or co @-@ ordin@@ ating in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
also the powers of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule is shown outside its effectiveness .
&quot; it is possible to take him at all , from being too late or have not taken the initial results seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school in which he worked , was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally - &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his pupils Georg R@@ atz@@ inger represents an excellent testimony , describes it as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincerely , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understand@@ ably &quot; , &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understand@@ ably &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly transported with cakes , bis@@ cuits and bon@@ sa@@ iled and &quot; always by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ ection@@ ism and its high emotion@@ ality , which also led to W@@ ut@@ aus@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; that he did not only cr@@ ush with chairs and cast off the ke@@ yr@@ ings with chairs , but also ear@@ ed guys on the hair or ears , he has already existed for years ago , deeply de@@ pl@@ ated and exc@@ used for it . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation of salvation , however , it has to be said that such education methods were widespread in the questionable time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents such as teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state Gymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the trans@@ lat@@ able sexual abuse and the powers of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ schule , are certainly dre@@ d@@ els . &quot;
&quot; if one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his acquain@@ tance , and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , many media have straight into it . &quot;
&quot; Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , are still di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
the truth is : the report de@@ fici@@ et Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
the media was reported in connection with the report very much about the issue of abuse at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen .
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also placed some processing or co @-@ knowledge regarding sexual abuse on the burden ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to become familiar to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to speak with my father or mother over it , &quot; &quot; said a du@@ sty substitute for the others , &quot; It was all very embarrassing for me . &quot;
the true issue in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame remain silent .
&quot; if they were not even parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir leader , who would have never been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ pupils R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : an un@@ questionable student formed it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely knowledge and would have been able to have the respective offen@@ ders .
&quot; I consider it ... also for really absurd to accept that there are some more pressing or more explicit , or more explicit than in front of their parents , inter@@ nat@@ ies , trust , etc . &quot;
that you speak to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; that in advance , the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him , could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation . &quot;
what sexual abuse is concerned is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger thus acqu@@ itted by every co @-@ knowledge .
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought him to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes as it was unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will look away in the report . &quot; &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but that is , in turn , is a abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely clean : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the g@@ ymnasium of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , between sexual abuse and violence as well , we say once , other alleg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not chor@@ us of the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
&quot; the whole gru@@ es@@ ome pedago@@ gy , the cases , in which Kn@@ itting from sa@@ di@@ st teachers were disper@@ sed and mal@@ adjusted , and they were all ent@@ an@@ gled on the pres@@ ch@@ ool in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys only when they were already on the Dom@@ sp@@ ar school . &quot;
&quot; on that was , as the most witnesses emphas@@ ise the topic &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &apos; heavenly &apos; conditions .
what was different from the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ing school ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was already discipline , but just no sa@@ di@@ st violence . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; a lot of victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even unite positive memories with it . &quot;
so much still remains the accus@@ ation to have looked away .
&quot; however , despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ schule . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he first began to establish himself and was responsible for the events of a school , where he had not worked and accountable , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again at 1993 . &quot;
prescri@@ wed Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the states consistently the ears ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ages , which was even reproduced in the report . &quot;
&quot; in this , he points to this to be practi@@ sed in the pres@@ ch@@ ool to continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; already given the danger of negative press representatives , he found urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed , as a test case in Bavaria has long since been prohibited . &quot;
&quot; before that , they opened up in a legal gray area , as each of us may well know . &quot;
&quot; that was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can not say , he would have always looked at . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the exam@@ iner in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis claimed yes , it was unfair , the current educational standards apply to the then time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; so the danger of the past is to be assessed according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
then the princess has already been right .
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse that was ab@@ omin@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken up in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of contradictions and violence against innocent children , which goes far beyond that time . &quot;
this is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally re@@ worked .
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , for all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear@@ ms and pull on the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then forbidden , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ed to it . &quot;
&quot; which image of his Regen@@ sburger Zeit has given George R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the conversations with you for the book &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic test also contribute to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book I am talking about the life of his brother Joseph , thus Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen played only a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I am not afraid that he led there a stric@@ ter regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; but this has to be said once again : without these perfec@@ tions , without the demanding unconditional discipline , it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ ts , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ ding alone , one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success , just to which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ over@@ lap . &quot;
&quot; as what kind of people , you have experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the talks about her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well acquainted with and over again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , profound , deep @-@ minded and hearty , from which one cannot imagine that he could also only do a fly . &quot;
&quot; I get regularly with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are still today , 23 years after its embar@@ king , keep in contact with him , read it , read it - he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him today , that he was strictly speaking to them , are therefore clearly in the minority . &quot;
&quot; most dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today , that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music . &quot;
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a str@@ ative father , certainly , that may be - but yet also a lovely respect person , to which they still have a look and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , clearly : all that you prefer , are gu@@ ardi@@ ans that were then on the day of the day . &quot;
we can be glad we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just one man , just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to medit@@ ate for the medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; the evil intention , which stands behind it , is only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , dischar@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; now , the settlement @-@ areas would have earned a 93 @-@ year old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bay@@ erns and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen , finally in peace . &quot;
