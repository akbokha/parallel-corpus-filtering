<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that make your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">A Irren-Anstalt where young people today should meet.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a greeting, where now is excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners manage the one reason for farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich encourages exciting stories to spend days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's more nervous when landcards are not up to date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had to look back for, because the car Navi takes place instead of a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical map of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the State Government, are anything but current - but is therefore very conclusive."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich's Munich has changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered canvas that can be seen as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the wide coverage map, for cities and communities were more detailed maps, so-called urpositional sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">This resulted in the statements of the Bayerische surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and in the beginning of the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French Heeresman occupied Bavaria since the spring 1800 during the Second World War War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and had a topographic record of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, if the French troops have finally moved to the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: today's neighbours, who created the idea of an area-wide Bavaria card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" "topographic Bureau" "- and thus the Bayerische surveying administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urquial leaf for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian National Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / Today is the example of the provincial capital in the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">One example of this is subsendling that appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856.</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was born 21 years after the map of the map, so 1877, as Munich's district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses subsendlings focus around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the rebellion of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: in addition, a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flaps from the so-called" urine "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels do not occupy themselves there today - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green space is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 swing of the October fests, was in the 19th century still a meadow, and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's District Chu-Haidhausen, one reads in the area of today's district of Au-Haidhausen not only the road name" at the Gasteig "or from the ascent" On the Lünen "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse plunging people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich Circle-Irrenanstalt was created in 1858 / 59."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard from Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig's II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and ended the quettes of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, Head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients there was first place, later it was extended to 500 seats."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity is no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the roundabout in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-East is one of Germany's biggest psychiatrist."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the Areal of the former Auer Anstalt, young people now meet in Munich's Salesianum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the Order acquired the building complex in 1920, and walked it into a youth-home with training establishments."</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east residential houses dating from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children of the house" "Casa Don Bosco" "set up at the origin of the Irrenanstalt, which had been destroyed during the Second World War by bombardment."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was named 1856 as" "main square", "the Kaufingerstraße named" "Kaufinger Gasse". ""</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War also in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs of the Allies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business buildings and a Gruftkapelle from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof, where these days will work and will take place on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the sliders, the old Munich card can be compared with the aerial photograph of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Citizenship group published travel service for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the national Association for the promotion of coloured colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri, due to discriminatory policy and racist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the federal state of Missouri, which is to come into force up to 28 August 2017, visits afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians, as a series of questionable, rums-based incidents can occur in the entire state and here," says it in the opinion of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it people harder to gain discrimination against minorities, as well as the prosecution bodies of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, caused the group to recover the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of the civil rights, the people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are put together or killed," "said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">"we hear complaints in such a frequency, which we have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group renounces such as racist transgressions against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline any more during the journey through the state and was put in custody by the police of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by the Office of the Advantant of Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will hold 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," "Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be ready to bring home-money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri promised 100 hate crime in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate-breaking-reporting program of the FBI that ranks the State in relation to the number of such violations on the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new missouri law, which would make it harder to complain a company due to residential or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberation Union (ACLU) had published travel arrangements for Texas and Arizona, after the states of immigration law had to commit people to prohibit the local law enforcement authorities, which will contribute to further racial violations, according to the opinion of ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel orders are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Weilaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fisheries bacher Weidefence-Project is a success project and will be continued in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Convention of Peter White and Kordula Kovac have gained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-grabenhof of the family Schwendemann, representatives of the fisherman CDU-village met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into its operation in which he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows, and also many young animals and housed in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "Black-milk" "is for him the alternate marketers for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste comes exclusively regionales.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of fishing bach, he referred to the" "elementary project". ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not produce any abrupt areas not profitable.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area, for much work, much has to be processed with the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003 he took over the parental operation and managed to run it without any chemical plant protection and fertilisers, even if he do not conduct any bio-operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for Mayor Thomas Schneider, Thomas Schneider was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the ordination project and is glad about the leader of the leader. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">We hope that the forestation of the areas could be moved up for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the greatest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thinking about how they continue their operation," "stressed the Mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers stand often in criticism because of the support</seg>
<seg id="84">"as a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure surface amounts to 40 hectares which are not allowed up to at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros was promoted half of the Leader, a quarter carried out by the municipality of Basbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do not have a really good job, without farmers and women."</seg>
<seg id="90">"even for Peter White was fixed:" "here the best food produced is produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">Landscapegoat (LPR) Baden-Württemberg allows the state-of-the-state support of pastes.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the disclosure of the Schwarzwald.</seg>
<seg id="93">The presence of one of the LPR signed by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the slowing surface must not be insensitive (Hangneiaover 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing bacher Weight in 2018 it is currently running the request of eight participants with 24 plots, which would like to build up just 16 kilometres of Zaun."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface amounts to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes on the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is it when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as much as any other - therefore the careful overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump-régime, knew certainly what he did when he had a symbolic Axt over the proposals of the president to drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have helped him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he resorted to their importance, and in particular the meaning that you have attributed to, as the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, its base was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained:" I don't want to go into a complete thing about history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to which later was added and not part of the original statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is correctly correct, but as he himself formed, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about Lazarus, the only words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only charges any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your tired, your arms, / your uppressing masses, who desire to breathe freely, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "eldest waste" was better to be seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller is not committed to literary critic - he clearly shows that these people are not welcome in Trumps.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and their friends who settled their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they have accomplished a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a reduced classical image.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself another name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on the American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people of the right wing had changed this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry as Rush Limbaugh, a type of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty does not invite anyone, but rather an early neoconservative, which brings the American flame into the circumvent world:" Lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is entirely and at all a question of the point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus was in it to see them as they did from the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful men after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships was seen."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge, and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and of course, this is not the perspective, which Miller and Trump should ever recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not enlighten the way, but hate the hate, who is their only source of power, igniting."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two beats to the team of Great Britain belonged</seg>
<seg id="130">"the Executive Director of the Leichtathletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-strong Kontlement will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which starts on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom has to learn something from it. "</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we figure it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the guy on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m stretch, while Eiliie Doyle was elected from the team to team capacity."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where they live or exercising, went out of space and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the eiliie was totally natural of course, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver Medal retired, who is playing at their fifth World Championships at the 400-m hurdle, says that it is" incredible "that 16 beats in the British team are."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best number of athletes at the World Championship was seven who were achieved in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The Muir-winged Muir leads on this road and took up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and 5.000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman that was included in the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first World Championships when the only other Schotte in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannitant captain tells that she is" enormously proud "on the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but also in some cases the medals and the Finals join the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special team to be of team captain, is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my team-mates voted for me and chose it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi who belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It shows only how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise on podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">"I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation, as we have a home world championship."</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put on this home support, and benefit from it that we are back at the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and there will be just such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking by critics about Facebook: Bewirb you not to have a public office if you cannot tolerate the uncover of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our land knew something of poor press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it wasn't long until the newspapers hit him because of everything, from the internal policy to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shook with criticism, safely."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not have his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said:" "the freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute we are led as the sheep to the battles."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland under Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work on it more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people and expressed their opinion on their official facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties promised him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the rod of the Governors sent the lawsuit as frivol, and the line comment was full of a counter-reaction with" "Na, and?." "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is just Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important when it is a guy like hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest level of approval by the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary Hitler head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very happy to use Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hasty head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the Board of Governors - the public forum, which is officially designated as officially, and by co-workers who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the Governors and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing but a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too easy to use the image of trout, or peers or hash-filled people who swing online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest presented the Bible in his post and appeals to Hogans Catholic Faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie, Md., was not hasserted but she asked for hate crime."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate and other current news, she wrote in the commentary area of the message" The Post. ""</seg>
<seg id="187">"I appreciate this idea even if a number of people are taking position on the same subject, then they are considered more likely to be considered as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors described as" "concentrated" "spam attack, others would probably call" intercede. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or deleted a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">It is much cleaner than in former times when you had the same done that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical guidance and to burn demonstrators or to burn protesters.</seg>
<seg id="191">But that is exactly what is happening digital.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticise that he implied Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell to Virginia last week.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County last the First Amendment, according to U.S. District James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when she appointed a voter from her facebook-side."</seg>
<seg id="196">And in Kentucky governor Matt Bein (R) also received a visit from ACLU due to its use of Facebook and Twitter.</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar impact like the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplies between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letter driver suggested for his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trough.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people, who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius "," wrote all the letters of newspapers that made Washington decisions. "</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that surveyed his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmable his ministry, according to historical documents that were collected by the George Washington Project by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not brought them silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, expression and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>

<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his crew will better cope with the experiences in preparation with the triple chain, than with the quadrupture chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"I do not yet know how to act in Aue," says his coach Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is his cause for sure, "because we are just in the three-positions at Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießmann players who can build well," "said Hoffmann."</seg>

<seg id="877">"but they do not know so 100% where they are currently standing," says the Interior of the Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">"while guests from the Rhineland go as an easy favorite on Sunday, at last (almost) finished in the stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we take them away, only because we have the claim to come under the first six, is Blödnonsense," says Funkel, whose balance at only one defeat against Aue from nine games is quite positive. "</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks did this little Earls Court apartment transformed into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bankers with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne did not spare their pockets.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex at Knightsbridge in a much larger room," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">"I was looking for something, that was comparable to my prize."</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square footage was completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a wasted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne storage space and a mezzanine add to the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"this was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms superior to one another, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to be creative thinking to solve the submission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelworks is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so that they were overthrown over, without having to pick us up."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height for the function or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement made it possible to place Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much extra drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic classy light window of Retrouvius down over the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille illumination set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"mirrors plays a role in addition to theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to leave it longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen the mirroring feels like a window into another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance has mirrored units space for all the briggles and glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"by the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folded kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went out there," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, furnitated MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is very important, so it is when you slide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to win extra 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the floor space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform one calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials which gives the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional connection in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you do not love yourself in the electric plugs in the walls.</seg>

<seg id="1363">"according to an agreement with her late father, Colin - by Paul as" "main operator and the dominant personality" "in the family De Lutis - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>

<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Politico reports that the new staff head of the White House plans to restrict the flow of flow to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in hope to keep the boss on a more evenly course.</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Staff President of the White House, who met his first working day with leading employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he replied: poor information that will get into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">"Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence, because the president would make better decisions when he would receive good information."</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to enumerate Trump by monitoring its meditations."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship to television dates back to decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was annoyed due to an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," said the former electoral campaigning Sam Nunberg in February to Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote about the time that" the key to hold trumps on Twitter's custom under control, according to six former electoral campaign officials to ensure that its personal media consumption includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trumps's Twitter" "was ever" under control "," is ridiculous. "</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe this campaign officials know something that we don't know other - that Trumps Tweets would have included even more villi without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">"we will probably never know anything about the tweets, the Trump has not been sent."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"when his staff made it a couple of times, they had to stick with him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"but no one has consistently prevented it consistently, that Trump controversies protrugated."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, which sets themselves from competitive parties, always try to move their own agenda by promoting Trump material that may possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">Politico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants who denounce the President for strategic reasons.</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example that was described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leakage, and that he will find out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February when someone accused the President of malicious a printed copy of a article by Gotnews.com, the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy level rod in Katie Walsh," the source behind a pile to be leakin in the White House. "</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was exiled due to rails from Twitter, or that he had no concrete evidence or that he voiced false accusations in the past, and revoke them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started to ask staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"added that the then Staff President Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries three months later to do the same.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and its consultants are still striving for influence."</seg>

<seg id="1480">"in the Russia-affair around US President Donald Trump, Robert Mueller will have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the panel was recorded during the past few weeks, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "in vocation with the cause of trusted persons."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper announced the step as a sign that Mueller expanded his investigation and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The sender CNN reported it already first forges of the Gremiums in connection with a meeting between the mumps of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">Us intelligence services accusing the Kremlin since long have been specifically mixed into the presidential campaign in the presidential campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were differences between the mumps of electoral team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are to stand up in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republican."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to the report, Mueller also took more and more trumps on private and business environment under the magnifier."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" Washington Post "wrote a few weeks ago that the special race was moved personally to the center and seek the reproach, whether the President hinders the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">"the main task of Grand juries is to examine and decide on this evidence in possible distortions, and decide whether the indictment is to be charged."</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand juries are therefore also referred to as counts.</seg>
<seg id="1491">Mostly they are switched on if there are bigger and controversial cases.</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure always takes place behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">"the Panel can also be switched from the prosecutor's office to invite people to detachment under Eid."</seg>
<seg id="1494">According to the Sender CNN already pre-invitations were already exhibited for the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were asked to be a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">Besides Trump Jr. there were also trumps of consultants and in-law-law Jared Kushner as well as his damar electoral manager Paul Manafort at the interview.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"right-wing extremists spoke on Thursday morning in U.S. television, that the decomposition show that Mueller does not let themselves be shy in his work and that he should be necessary to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it would not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be switched off at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the composition of the Gremiums is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations, and a new reason for president Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening took a speech in West Virginia to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia-story is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>

<seg id="1508">"you have no reason to accept that something changed, it was on the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had been fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this kind of root, accusations were turned out loud by Trump, he did not want to impede the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"Comey said in June in front of a Senate committee, Trump have asked him to investigate the investigation against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure due to the investigation.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent of climate change has played a role in the decline of ice-blood, it is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"in total, however, it has been a series of unusual interruptions of ice rops in the region, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be linked to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken poss was so far a part of Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swims down to the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this archipelago was the balance of waxing and aborting some years ago disturbed.</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a full swing was smashed from there, writes AWI research, Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are some things that also the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger, as the front candid have never withdrawn so far as at present."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice-top stand up with tension and could be smashed if at a keypoint is a piece of brake."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase the sea level, as it pushes water on the water and pushes ice as much water as it comes after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of shame is that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in the low extent, writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic (MIDAS)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is after AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres and is the fourth most part of the Antarctica.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"on the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"though it is a natural happening and has no direct connection to climate change, the ice shield is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most far retreat since the beginning of the records," confirmed he too. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists is controversial, whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will be back again or long run and possibly collapsed, his colleague said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" "our models say it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers fall back to climate change, this gigantic iceberg can not lead to climate change, so many Eisschelfe of the antarctic peninsula are smashed away in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long ornamental of the Antarctica extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">According to data from the British Antarctic Survey the ice surface of the Antarctic peninsula has decreased by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s.</seg>
<seg id="1548">The drop in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The staff of weekly Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars. "</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss, which feels more secure: they are supposed to take their children with the office, which were the target of an attack with granates, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponent, Neutral, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters, to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and abdominal cells."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected, at the salary list of the government or cartels, a catalog of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest break from the violence, and while in the whole country the corpses are more frequent: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 took his position. 589 are under Federal protection and so far there was at least seven deaths in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter there is their publisher and their inspirator by Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his absence is felt deep, although its presence is present everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows its midfinger with the word" Justice "," T-shirts, which show his smiling face with spectacles or its typical Panamahut. "</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, its nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was built a Sono-Bundesanwald, in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the Committee for the Protection of journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murder that are connected with drug trafficking and organised crime each year, the murderer of journalists will rarely be brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa although it is untracked and although the terrain is now more traitor."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of safety has little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know why, we do it all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot down, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - the" Twelfter River "." "</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius took away in his car and damaged it near.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to wander freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the topic of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa each day someone else or several people will be shot on the street or that the cemetery is full of indexed, two-storey mausols of drugs called drugs, which are larger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first in February, the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartels in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, suspected gangsters purchased each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kioske."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez not to force, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, the country to its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate him that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he was working as an experienced reporter in 2003, when he joined with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to operate journalism without pushing the noise issue," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising took place."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it to publish hard urging investigations without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"after the foundation of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors-Cabot-Prize "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee for the Protection of journalists for his courage in pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it was."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He was voluntary to give that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to live further," "he said at the time of CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "is a way of life," he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV in the last October. "</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task of falling as a journalist - either that or you play the fool.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I don't want to be asked:" "what did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not say, what happened before?"</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was able to fluff the friend, who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">You trust in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar across from the office, go there always sitting at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"well, ask them, was his love for the routine of his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions regarding how they do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"you may not like it if you're dealing with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their homework and cross-lanes, to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-compliance."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instinct.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier happens. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer considered in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smugents, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>

<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no mobile phones were allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a vitiered building in a mid-storey building in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters were asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the policemen, who referred to the governor themselves as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is a few months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where the drug gangs are de facto controlled."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has concentrated on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the government spending that concentrated on the hometown of the Governors.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that held in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, one block from the office of the Prosecutor's office."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter sent out public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri) which ruled almost the whole century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri-governors have been accused of high-class cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the Reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went into a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months before, the reader had seen the column of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"earlier we had already knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" because of its slender body stature. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez has been dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to the murder of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists on behalf of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">"reporters Miriam Ramirez, a few signs and went in the next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country journalists have become more strongly influenced by rewritten in organized protests" "SOS Press" "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">This day the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez.</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez, the authorities, recompose journalists and bring them into account, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has asked about it since then, that it is again divided by the government because it is concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly told that journalists in Mexico will be surrounded by organised crime, by participating government officials and a similar society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-journalism "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug bankers, but also on command of politicians and security forces working with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media-Wächsgroup" Articulo 19 "has been assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials over the past year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you think because they would like that you disproportionate the mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>

<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology "described him as" the besterned dinosaurs who ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs which lived in the middle of chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1929">"according to reports at National Geographic, the equarmored plant-vores is the most preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something of what was missing from the surrounding rock, and decided to see more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil-engineered from him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to expose the wild animal inside the 2,500 pounds (1.100 kg) heavy Erdklens."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it is considered to be one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs specimens, the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant-fresser, although he is covered with armor and a changing tank, probably of meat eating dinosaurs is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage in order to hide themselves from predators, and used an aboutward arking that is used as an antidosed, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix better in its surroundings and to soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million year old creature from the family of the Nodosauaurs took the headlines in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it was called Borealopelta markchelli according to the Museum Technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours since it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astounding maintenance of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the patterns, and the form of scales and armor over their bodies."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered counter-refusal, a widespread defensive method in animal kingdom, meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-refusal is usual, the results are surprising, since the size of Borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted from enough pressure by meat-eating dinosaurs, that the evolution of the confrontation as a means of survival favoured."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals, who use the counter-change - think of deer, zebras or Gürk-animals - are much smaller and vulnerable as loot, which signaled that this Nodosaurs was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strongly armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs-predators of the Cretaceous must have been" "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in its scaling shows also that the skin of the dinosaur-brown was brown.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including its consistent Darminhaltes to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, was driven into a river and driven into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern Bohemia, today, and rivers and oceans are likely much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this nodosaurs is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with conserving skin, but also in three dimensions remains and the original form of the animal is maintained," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you only have a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is in sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, was hunted the armored dinosaurs of some of its horrific ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocanthaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tonnes heavier monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was enshrined after death in the sea and was reinfected in mud.</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the lively dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is totally of the muzzle up to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long tops that raked by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-vores was shaken by the Western Canada, until a flooding river was flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater order of the dinosaur did not keep his armor in an exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The hidden remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved that the skin remains still bumpy panels along the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a gain in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see, the more confusing it gets."</seg>

<seg id="2019">How a activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken until their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after she arrived in New York City, the St. Louis was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment, which she rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">They stumbled upon a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and there is still on the street, it was called there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly on its timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was here, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo., was killed, live live."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he faded a picture of browns lebloous body, who was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that is wild," said Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She placed her cell phone to return later on evening to Tweet over people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and by a man who claimed to be Browns father who said a sign with the inscription:" Fergusons police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">They watched a live Feed at which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman is his rifle and crying," "I will kill you... animals all kill you."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," recalled Ferrell's statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we got accustomed to and which we can typically call.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt sweat-frost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept.</seg>
<seg id="2038">You booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "," in the movie from the age of 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and the protest, of love and loss, of strength and resistance, which consists of the viewpoint of people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as a Ferrell with her daughter, who carried a floral dress and a suitable crown, according to Ferguson, the two had a conversation she had a lot of times before this morning" about the black experience and the black state. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I've taught you when black people have to fight for it, what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are going to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be reared in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which they personally have not experienced a blatant racism, it is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would give her a bad service to keep them away from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was built into a Campsite when activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"in addition, Ferrell and her daughter joined with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets before and halves them to pass on protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">It slowly began to accept a new type of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9, she said and noticed that she was as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came from Ferrell in mind:" "do you document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism is nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan said recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area who is known for his activism by Todestrakt."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer to the project, together with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browns Error."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talking to us. we talk," "said Davis"</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people will be presented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrells experience - to show that it is at the movement" not about a Messiah leader, but to a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most obvious candidate in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets show "" surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life, how she loves and marries her wife. "</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I have understood that there must be certain vulnerability in this work, and in the dehumanization of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrells history repeated history the role of black gay women in the wider black lives of lives."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killing of the black teenager Trayfrom Martin in 2012 have shaped the film" BlacklivesMatter "in social media identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in managerial positions have borne the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main load of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to remark, to notice that" the movement is really kept by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is however, that" this is not a affirmative type of action "that has been selected by the Ferrell due to its identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy out," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront, because in a life on these crosses as a black, gay woman is so much at stake."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the cameras arrived in Ferguson long ago, but the racial links between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on currency for 2 ½ years due to blocking a highway in a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which she calls her home:" a mess. "</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clauses on an vocals and she feels obliged to have her memory since three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We need to love and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "sizes": TV readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south-east of the pedestrian zone, since the first presentation in 2009, the population in proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold leaves the subject hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Also on our Facebook page "Folklore and Bitburg" the topic will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"say the one to the bit gallery:" "that would be a dream" "(Nicole Carnival), comes from the other side:" "does not need a person" "(Siggi Betzen) or simply plain:" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates assume that a gallery draws more customers into the city, of which the rest of the business will benefit, fear the opponents that then bleeding the pedestrian area."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the peasant market hall is standing on the 13 direct market-market products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">It will be the end of the construction work.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the gallery makers want to integrate a markethall in the new building - in addition to Beda-Square with possibility, for sitting outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying nearly weekly in the peasant market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women are always very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher we have discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to appreciate that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether multiplying in a market hall in the gallery, arrives at the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should probably not be low in the new project, but it is likely to be low."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "why shopping Palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"clothing, shoes, drugents or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There are already enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One looks like many charging shops here are empty - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but here there is not even a decent weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, mostly directly from the producer and is also very inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as one sees, charging stores will be reserved in a shopping centre only by larger companies, because the dorms are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special shops there is almost no more and what is left of it, will probably still disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a market hall does not fit together for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farmers market during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit-gallery will actually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does it manage to distribute the specter bit gallery before, all stores from Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will simply not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, also needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But for a peasant-market it will give thanks to the insane-heartfelt many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg is no place anymore.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmers market hall is made, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">One suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which hang out almost unremarkably - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the Artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tubs and haircuts that were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the cuts out of the prison of Fort Leavenworth, where the former intelligence-Analyst did a 35-year prison sentence after it publicly announced diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2nd, is called A Becoming resemblance (A fitting similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was converted into technology, computer science, and art, and Manning, a transwife and repellent dissident, whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he was only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted from the algorithms analysis of DNA that could be extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits, if also something intellectual comment could not only be interpreted in the formability of DNA data - the many ways they may be interpreted, and the inherent determinations of these interpretations - but also to the identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly sentenced to the identification as a woman since their puberty, including six violations of the pionage law, computer deception and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"due to the prison, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a baskets, black-white self-white, in which Manning is obviously uncomfortable on a driver's seat and a platinblonde perfiantly has been associated with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in it produced the artist portrait of strangers from forensic artifacts like cigarette mute and chewing gum, making the DNA extract from the waste to produce a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when they received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "declared Dewey-Hagborg with a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">The artist and her incarcerated Muse were exchanged for unequal brilliance over the course of two years.</seg>
<seg id="2139">"it was created even one of the" "Comic" "Suppressed Images," who predicted a future in which President Chelation would be able to convert verdict and would be able to personally see the exhibition personally. "</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama actually took only a few days after the book was released, Manning release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happenings."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition a little woop and Starke, since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new, tweeful ways to fix the rigid divisions that he actually should fix further."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen from a particular reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written on the artistic statement called Manning with its oversized signature, including the" i "in her family names (the" i "in her family name) have been an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose basis is gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandwich of Cs and Gs and As, in pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show the involvement of the 200 characters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopaedia of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological point, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people hopefully will take will take care of who we are and how openly genetic data is for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell as many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition kept in an own room, is one side from the above mentioned comic Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she reappears with a release-elefon in the hands of the disciplinarbarracks of the United States such as King-Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they write your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist who greet from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, when I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was predicted in the comic book - but if they should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, of their own genomic simulations, which collapsing like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, as everything was written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic compartments were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had her on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of crowds," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed with Chelsea, like the movement, which was also hidden behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeried professor for robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye-colour of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them more often more often," said Mr. Sharkey in the publication of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuds have developed from their inflatable partners to robot with a silicone that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adjust its robot according to his beliefs," and doing everything from the eye of the robot about the form of nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it will be even more disturbing, since many robots possess the" personalities, "which would be a Stepford-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen developed to robots with a silicate skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties that can be appealing, such as relapses."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is still the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities such as "Frigid Farrah," which conveys the impression of relapses and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," "warms the site of True One."</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so may they like what you like, and they don't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" in mood "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robotic - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underwhelming female properties, the playes on rape, if one goes a step towards Frigid (is called here: withdrawing) Farrah only, beadfastly one of the most."</seg>

<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibration, why can men do not have Roxxxy?" is it on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origin and increasing sophistication show something more dark and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of equal rights of the sexes to a desire for sex with subjugation as oppressing encore."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course have no sex robots, and while FRR noted its rising popularity, they still remain provisional on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaved out of the boundary zones, can be in relation to the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market there is permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened, in which there is a president in the White House, who has praising women sexually."</seg>

<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically feasible (even with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">"their builders want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate or simply go away from their companion.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no placement or a background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the fantasy of total submission."</seg>

<seg id="2579">Red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD (inflammation). "</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study maintains exactly the opposite: a diet, which is rich in meat-based proteins and milk products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition that affects approximately 1,3 million and in the United Kingdom 300,000, causes gastrils and pureations, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while the affected is usually to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells which promote a tolerant intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the gut patrol to ensure that damaging microbes that hide in the food not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to emulate inflammation, are balanced by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damage sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far towards inflammation, it can result from a inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments has been found that a type of tolerance of tolerance is found in mice, which carry a certain bacterium in their initis."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the blocks of proteins - to emulate the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice in their food had, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an an tryptophan-rich diet tolerant tolerant, less inflamed bowel bacteria, if the same system also wires with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoctoral studies in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that encourages the tolerance when it found out that a group of study bands had such cells, but another group of the same tribe that was not separated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspect that the difference had to do with the intestinal microbiomes of the mice, the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the Därme of the mice, DNA sequencated and were found six species that were present in mice with the immune cells, but without fail at mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were lacking a intestinal microbial and they did not developed these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria reacted to the immune system, the researchers were able to grow on the immune system, and then resulted in small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells that were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan-metabolism that is known as an idol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent, but if the tryptopicvalues were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerant cells, such as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-adrenal products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as with mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines. "</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophanvalues can lead to an expansion of this population.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report drafted by Pope Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of waste deficient Pope Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misused scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weissener, spokesman for the reform movement" We are the Church, "stated after the publication of the German press agency, he received from former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the appearance of the Catholic Church much, if Müller and Ratzinger would understand their deep missal about their own omissions or their then false assessment of processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican" Osservatore Romano "refers, on the contrary, criticized that in the coverage of violence at the Domspatzen, with" two levels "measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt no one that would have to be punished for" shameful and shameful action, "says the" degree medial manipulation, "the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and a member of the national Italian Bioethics committees."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of defining the Catholic Church as a source of all evil, is already part of the present experience and prepares public opinion to hold this for normal" "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"also Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis argued in the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "we would like to go to the church, and that is a whisper frescoes."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" bat had been a very normal pedagogical means "to be finished with friends, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">They falls it unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades because the world has changed.</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse, the Pope Georg Ratzinger was often deaf."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who spoke with Ratzinger the reminder band" My brother of Pope '(in 12 languages). "</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protecting," says Hesemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," "evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment scientist Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the early 1990s" with high Plausibilities "victims of assault, 67 dominatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was active from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, the Domkapellmeister R. has been used in many cases of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students was also severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims of R. estimates the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even unite positive memories with it."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in an interview, Hesemann, why the thesis report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger took up his opinion to be discharged."</seg>
<seg id="2909">Mr Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the "incidents of violence" by the Regensburger Domspatzen "gives an contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to a lift many students take up its" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, which was tangible in the oil, when a domain name musically brought with no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: when you are doing the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself about why the name of Georg Ratzinger really occurs in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is dedicated straight to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted from any suspicion of mediaean or co-ordinating in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">Also the powers of violence at the preschschule is shown outside its effectiveness.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"it is possible to take him at all, from being too late or have not taken the initial results seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzenging school in which he worked, was felt by practically all respondents as - so literally -" salvation "," "Heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger represents an excellent testimony, describes it as" warm, "" sincerely, "" competent "" and "" understandably "," sincere, "" competent "" and "" understandably "," the guys regularly transported with cakes, biscuits and bonsailed and "always by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfecectionism and its high emotionality, which also led to Wutausages."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he did not only crush with chairs and cast off the keyrings with chairs, but also eared guys on the hair or ears, he has already existed for years ago, deeply deplated and excused for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation of salvation, however, it has to be said that such education methods were widespread in the questionable time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents such as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state Gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the translatable sexual abuse and the powers of violence at the preschschule, are certainly dredels."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"if one wonders if it is not more likely to do with his acquaintance, and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, many media have straight into it."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, are still diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">The truth is: the report deficiet Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">The media was reported in connection with the report very much about the issue of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen.</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also placed some processing or co-knowledge regarding sexual abuse on the burden?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to become familiar to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to speak with my father or mother over it," "said a dusty substitute for the others," It was all very embarrassing for me. "</seg>
<seg id="2935">The true issue in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims of shame remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they were not even parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader, who would have never been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-pupils Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an unquestionable student formed it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely knowledge and would have been able to have the respective offenders.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... also for really absurd to accept that there are some more pressing or more explicit, or more explicit than in front of their parents, internaties, trust, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you speak to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the very clear result:" that in advance, the students and / or their environment were entrusted to him, could not be confirmed in the framework of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">What sexual abuse is concerned is Georg Ratzinger thus acquitted by every co-knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of having not prevented him or brought him to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes as it was unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media was a lot of" "violence" "at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger will look away in the report." ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that in the reporting everything was mixed and mixed up to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but that is, in turn, is a abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely clean: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence as well, we say once, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not chorus of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole gruesome pedagogy, the cases, in which Knitting from sadist teachers were dispersed and maladjusted, and they were all entangled on the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys only when they were already on the Domspar school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that was, as the most witnesses emphasise the topic" "preschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even 'heavenly' conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the Domspatzenging school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was already discipline, but just no sadist violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" a lot of victims of the general humanity of R. estimates and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even unite positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">So much still remains the accusation to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the preschschule."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he first began to establish himself and was responsible for the events of a school, where he had not worked and accountable, (so the witness) did not want to hear, and then again at 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Prescriwed Georg Ratzinger in front of the states consistently the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengages, which was even reproduced in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this, he points to this to be practised in the preschool to continue to be practised."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already given the danger of negative press representatives, he found urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was of course at a time when legal clarity existed, as a test case in Bavaria has long since been prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they opened up in a legal gray area, as each of us may well know."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"that was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can not say, he would have always looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the examiner in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed yes, it was unfair, the current educational standards apply to the then time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we are talking about the" pitfalls of Anachronism, "so the danger of the past is to be assessed according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse that was abominable at all times and also not for what was broken up in the preschool of contradictions and violence against innocent children, which goes far beyond that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally reworked.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger, for all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so earms and pull on the hair and ears were widely used in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then forbidden, he has also kept strictly adhered to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"which image of his Regensburger Zeit has given George Ratzinger, because in the conversations with you for the book" My brother of Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic test also contribute to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book I am talking about the life of his brother Joseph, thus Pope Benedikts XVI., tells his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I am not afraid that he led there a stricter regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this has to be said once again: without these perfections, without the demanding unconditional discipline, it would probably hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trants, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonding alone, one does not even make a big singer and stand before every success, just to which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overlap."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"as what kind of people, you have experienced Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I experienced Georg Ratzinger really well acquainted with and over again as wonderful, humorous, profound, deep-minded and hearty, from which one cannot imagine that he could also only do a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I get regularly with how many former Domspatzen are still today, 23 years after its embarking, keep in contact with him, read it, read it - he is almost blind - and he is like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him today, that he was strictly speaking to them, are therefore clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">"most domspatzen are grateful to him today, that he enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music."</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strative father, certainly, that may be - but yet also a lovely respect person, to which they still have a look and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, clearly: all that you prefer, are guardians that were then on the day of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust one man, just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to meditate for the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the evil intention, which stands behind it, is only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, discharged him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the settlement-areas would have earned a 93-year old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside Bayerns and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
