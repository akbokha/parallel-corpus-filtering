gol@@ fers Lan@@ ger receives the Sport@@ pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf course in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger looking for a bit of di@@ version with some colleagues on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Sport@@ pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses rec@@ alled in their evening , they j@@ agu@@ ed in the fast g@@ allo@@ p home to the for@@ age group . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this temp@@ o , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and in this way the riding arri@@ er ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fers of all time - 101 tournament r@@ ents - back near horses .
&quot; he let himself lead himself with his family via the plant of AL@@ RV , on a horse , he doesn &apos;t get himself for photo purposes . &quot;
for a long time the first time in Aachen and with the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sports help ran@@ ged the man from An@@ hausen in the context of a small gala the Golden Sport@@ pyramid .
awards lack of awards for the sympathetic athletes .
&quot; publisher , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already opened him .
the 18th winner of the Sport@@ pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means very much &quot; , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements , but also for social commitment . &quot;
for decades Lan@@ ger encourages the offspring .
and so he continued the prize @-@ fee of 25.000 Euro in the same way .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the double @-@ time Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was recorded on Saturday at the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ ging Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ve , the fe@@ eder Corn@@ elia , Alexander P@@ ush and Ar@@ nd Sch@@ mit@@ t , the daughter of Paul @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the painter Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ th@@ um the hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men had come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative company moved into the Spring@@ stadi@@ on where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger retained a distance to the big animals .
Clin@@ tons and Tr@@ umps economic policies compared : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the Trade Agreement T@@ TP - who want both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential de@@ posit@@ ors are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in the economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a basic , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
who , on the role of the state . &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns that how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to lay down the economy to death and regulate them , he says . &quot;
&quot; himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , claims cl@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely go back to regulations , and it is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax approaches - for private people and for businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has certain tasks to fulfil , he has dis@@ proportionate opportunities to open and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would be increased for the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the subject of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton almost wor@@ sen . &quot;
the democratic application in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure include classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ ap@@ y @-@ wing of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; thus , the internal discussions could be sent to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal power plants and re @-@ use coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil @-@ funding should also be possible in so far protected areas , the Paris climate agreement will announce it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and call for renewable energy for its investment programme : &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far away from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ azi@@ on@@ ess trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them want to isolate the US not from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; the should then also be paid better , for example Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage from 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a famine .
she wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage needs to be , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics hold him in front of him , so that the deficit deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who at least want to demand for the rich , that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; each runner woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is a part of women who escape alone , almost for everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each has a baby in doing the most one year old .
one has put her little son in his arm .
he was curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother rigid on the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ sing the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until one speaks with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is an area manager of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance offerings in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen were spot@@ ted .
&quot; they live in the north of Munich , one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all@@ est women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Family and Munich &apos;s Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
males do not exist - also not as visitors .
the exception is an wax in front of the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made their flight experience with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee for wars because they are politically per@@ secuted , because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope for Europe . &quot;
&quot; among women , other reasons for the escape : &quot; many ste@@ al themselves secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home country they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary pat@@ ron@@ age , slavery , or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this is driving them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act , is no r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , is told , &quot;
even here women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferi@@ or and worst .
&quot; this results in fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich , is traumati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntary . &quot;
many women are used to say they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experiences , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as they often fail to help themselves , there are more accommodations only for them . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answers with no . &quot;
in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken approximately there are such a thing in accommodations of governments .
&quot; also in Schw@@ aben , alone , women were not separated alone , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are some common accommodations or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender equality &quot; rights in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men .
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that both men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; lack of privacy is lacking men and women together , it can be - continuous - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; laundry rooms should be separated and accessible to women , is available in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel in need of this protective experience , one can read in the urge that there are on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since she has spoken to us that there is us , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily take a second home .
assistant disputes : demands for new work amp@@ f@@ measures
vice @-@ dep@@ u@@ ties of the assistance have called to help create new work amp@@ er measures with their disputes on a new contract .
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) called for its entire Council , from beginning September more work stimul@@ ations . &quot;
the J@@ DC said that the Minister would have failed to address the concerns relating to the contract .
&quot; assistance and medical students have voted in July about the rejection of a contract , which has been agreed with BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members , who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , said the President of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court , that the government &quot; pers@@ ist@@ ently silent &quot; would have remained silent on the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC Board voted to fully reject the proposed new contract and requ@@ esting the official new negotiations to all those concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC committee today asked a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to escal@@ ate a working programme of escal@@ ating labor measures , which begin in early September . &quot;
&quot; the disputes led to that assistance in the year 1960 , the first total cas@@ u@@ alties in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the BM@@ A Ass@@ istenz@@ ologists Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came to the election to reject the agreed contract conditions , which were recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that were still found before the vote by the 5@@ 4.000 doctors and medical students , with that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the Treaty of doctors in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : a &quot; alliance of external lateral &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended up a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday , to announce their hands and to announce an official end to the last eight months of the long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gol@@ ese hall of the St. Petersburg Palace of Palace in receipt , I can not rep@@ el the impression that Ankara is willing to deliver that reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; however , Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles had an in@@ alli@@ ble , and he hardly radi@@ ates warmth , even for his back behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , said repeatedly by his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could not count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even further improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described Erdo@@ gan as though I had never heard something bad . &quot;
I seemed to indicate the opposite rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable radi@@ le showed that the State of Russia had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes : the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction at the time was sore burned .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to fallen back in the back .
the failure was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend .
rebuild the v@@ ases becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media had a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed that the Turks would carry the blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of leaders , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family benefited from illegal oil @-@ trafficking in regions of Syria , who controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he denied this v@@ eh@@ ement .
but in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia was able to book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the benefits of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after spending the last month with a failed state coup d almost his ministry .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number is decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a bel@@ t@@ seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , projected the state remote with cheaper fruit and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imported goods will be allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti form@@ at@@ ched it like : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry with the West since its reaction to the attempted power of power is considered weak answer .
&quot; to this end , the continued res@@ entment takes over the snow@@ fall of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ tiful to move out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian President won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the government to call support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace in the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey , one as described by myself an analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of external lateral &quot; &quot; : two countries that have rejected and treated badly and now . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the largest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support contradic@@ tory pages . &quot;
&quot; it could be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours of first talks , both presidents spoke at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ ped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately promised to respond to a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect disco@@ ver@@ er than the NATO member of Turkey the Russian Kampf@@ jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least talk to each other again .
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland is no longer available
&quot; according to the Bank President , the R@@ BS brand will be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Board of Directors of the Bank . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside of Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the global ambitions of the bank .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ ancing itself since it was almost collap@@ sed and saved almost eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; in this time brand &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer financial brands . &quot;
&quot; it supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she decided to move more national brands into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the private client business that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B will become our Invest@@ ors brand as well as the brand , under which our employees will be employed as we are now becoming a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now , that we do not pursue global goals , but to pursue local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees are working among these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to develop the brands of brands , because how do we focus inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; the leader said . &quot;
three years ago it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal if we had said that we will be a great bank for our clients and would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can restore these brands again , therefore I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori gains its 3.@@ 000@@ ten prize at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ yed champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ ten prize . &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori assured on Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ ten British gain in New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local track with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , which reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester pig@@ gy , Pat Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ month winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won it at G@@ hay@@ yar , said , &quot; It is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is also here
&quot; I am very happy about it to happen at New@@ market , because I am landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the je@@ bel when he fet@@ ches the victory in Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached a milestone in the hin@@ dering race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a temporary career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the ninth @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4.@@ 4@@ 93 career @-@ class &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and there is no surprise that he has reached this milestone just a few in front of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans for years been enthusiastic for this sport . &quot;
I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already scored 6,000 profits if he would not only be a weekend and Groß@@ tur@@ ni@@ er@@ jo@@ ckey !
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has nearly 30 years of winning players , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a bri@@ tish race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Fl@@ ying finishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve @-@ wr@@ acking .
&quot; a whole series of grand@@ tur@@ ni@@ ers , including its famous &quot; glorious Si@@ eben &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulties when he returned from his six month of six months , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy its branches and to return to his order . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russia Putin fir@@ mer President Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has dis@@ missed his staff leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the ti@@ sts of trust in Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed to the special office for environmental and transport matters .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged his duties as chairman of the Russian presidential administration without giving reasons &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who was a proxy since 2012 , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; he was born in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn in 1972 , he made his degree at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website ( in Russian ) it was called on the head of the governing board and the executive director of the government personnel .
&quot; he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think that it &apos;s the most important task of the government to support your work as a head @-@ head regarding legislative acts and controls for implementing your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time one of the closest conspir@@ ators Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief Executive Officer , he was one of the most powerful men of the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , that was broadcast on television , the two men claimed that the staff head will return at his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles for the cameras , here are few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power struggle ?
this is currently nobody knows .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who once said to be a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov &quot; it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - compl@@ aining for four years . &quot;
as it turns out I have been chairman of the Russian presi@@ ding administration for four years and eight months .
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin has been a member of the Security Council of K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who created the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his replacement . &quot;
when Putin got into power he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted the most trusted .
&quot; once it was believed that Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia since Putin &apos;s second term , since there was a third term of Putin &apos;s struggle against the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , near allies Put@@ ins , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before coming back to the president three and a half years later .

Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected with fix@@ ations
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the north @-@ deck of the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sings connected to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four resolutions on the &quot; &quot; Deck@@ blo@@ wer &quot; &quot; to end the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 loops . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown , the construction site today visited a visit and was one of the first coming from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; that is a historical and symbolic moment when building the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sings .
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering from a truly epic degree in this project with over 30,000 tons of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bracel@@ ets in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets today in Ros@@ y@@ th a subject for the deck , which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first install@@ ment represents a significant milestone in every bre@@ eder project . &quot;
this fantastic project marks the forward @-@ looking forward @-@ looking high@@ - and deep @-@ construction .
&quot; after installing the last street @-@ cut section and its connection with the expansion of the North @-@ deck , we had to close the still existing gap on the North or Land@@ side . &quot;
this was reached by dra@@ gging the bridge 700 mil@@ lim@@ etres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 m long is , approximately 6,000 tons weighs and had to be pulled up by approximately 3 % . &quot;
&quot; well as the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , tiny were - on each side they bore only a few mil@@ lim@@ etres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have to be lucky still alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; happiness to be alive &quot; , &quot; after having been thrown off from the fishing boat at Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI rescue station suggested on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty to swim in security , while their boat moving out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and set us the worst , &quot; &quot; said the director of the b@@ ail@@ out department of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds used the boat from their range until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found at a bo@@ wel without a life@@ jacket .
they came all on board the shore boat and were brought back to the ambul@@ ance station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were cast into the water will have luck un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the bo@@ wel , though , had an emergency cl@@ ut@@ ches , but this sol@@ dering the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has awakened over these men today .
difficult hurt - man p@@ out on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; as the police yesterday afternoon , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to get his personal things . &quot;
instead the cut of soft offen@@ ders the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when he came into the apartment , he stood twice upon them . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and by the body .
the police could take the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend were destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
this alar@@ ming with his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the ex @-@ mate of the man .
&quot; when the two women joined the apartment again , the first 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and resor@@ ted to his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschwei@@ g affordable housing ?
the SPD and Green mean : investors should in future be taken much stronger in the future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschwei@@ g will lose almost 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments in the next few years ? &quot;
the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; action concept . &quot;
yet controversy is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who will actually build the cheap apartments ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD Group leader Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Greens : who wants to build on urban areas , should in future 20 percent of all apartments in social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock . &quot;
&quot; the big issue in the city hall is , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do we deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent , but as 20 per cent of apartments are building as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban construction program , which will cost millions , and must be financed still , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few regulations as possible .
the Left wants to still har@@ ness its conditions for investors .
&quot; regardless of its , as viol@@ a , a shar@@ pen@@ ing of the situation on the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will provide additional tasks in the building administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the professionals .
&quot; the program is not entirely clear : for the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; how is the loss of further 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments out of which funding will be exp@@ ired after the next few years ? &quot;
it will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , such as the plann@@ er Spe@@ akers of Nicole Palm , should now be bought off @-@ running Bin@@ dings from the city . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it would have to be thought to get back home again . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
one stroke can solve the problem .
because in the western city a year @-@ end dates run out .
around 1800 apartments you could get back to the prices of affordable housing .
only : we do not want the owners to do the housing companies .
&quot; since then , the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increasing , one is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called thorough@@ fare . &quot;
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few neighbour@@ hoods .
the Greens count that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; group of Chairman Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says , &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U must be with the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more construction sites for family @-@ family dwell@@ ings .
but what does not mean that there is still a compromise to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , which is worth it &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; that teenage children and child are not going to go outside , but rather prefer to spend their free time to spend on screens , was compl@@ ained over the last decade of many . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it is about getting people from the sofa and become more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters , initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later , resulting from a drawing series , play@@ cards and other spin @-@ off ) . &quot;
&quot; like many phenomena of pop culture sun@@ k the interest in the publication of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that over@@ thrown the server .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons who are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they have found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps , which returns the &quot; average &quot; person each day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , which has been pro@@ secuted 3@@ 5.000 users , the Washington Post recently shared with that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of nights followed , which begin every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who is playing Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public educational campaigns to health , people want to bring about &quot; &quot; 30 minutes time &quot; &quot; to get involved &quot; &quot; from the sofa , &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical exercise helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the Wonder@@ ful thing of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors , making them fun . &quot;
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people even exclude new friend@@ ships in the hunt .
&quot; as always , there is also met@@ ric pi@@ pers , who have always to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps were able to follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will leave with the time .
&quot; because of Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , however , there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ist in the real world and will help many people in hunting to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ amm@@ o
forget the pressure .

Simone Bil@@ es is all this im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .

stunning on the ground .
on gan@@ zer line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympi@@ asi@@ er .
the 19 @-@ year American Tur@@ it@@ ress kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday to the multi@@ dimensional title and enlarged the gap between yourself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the head@@ lights of the Olympic Games .
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; Final Five &quot; teams in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ werk Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina .
&quot; Americ@@ a. Simone Bil@@ es are on the pig bal@@ ancing during the single @-@ session of women in the art of art at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth hetero@@ sexual American , who wins a multi@@ dimensional title and overall the fifth , while she solidi@@ fies its reputation , the best of its generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears than her final result showed and her long journey was at that moment an end .
&quot; this success marks them in the same league such as Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has been dominated by its sport species last three years , including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - including 10 gold medals - having a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ ress of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Ret@@ tone by her said that she is &quot; the best tur@@ it@@ ress I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was expected to have a final examination in Brazil , a competition which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not going back with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be seen as a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; American sisters Simone Bil@@ es , left and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace , after they have won gold and silver in the single multi @-@ struggle for women at the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es fet@@ ched the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell celebration of themselves in retirement , Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi served as an expression . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es ins@@ isted on the top , never the future is planned , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their sedi@@ ments - which included their typical tum@@ bling pass - is matched to Latin American music which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child , was adopted by his grandparents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing at the gym , in which Bo@@ or@@ man tra@@ inated , was used for power . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 she has not lost a multi @-@ class competition , a strainer series that will persist for as long as it does . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led by two turn@@ ups slightly , dec@@ ep@@ ted the picture . &quot;
sul@@ p@@ bal@@ ken and bo@@ dent@@ ures - in which it holds the World Championship - lau@@ ded .
they brought back with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the float again - and sat down on the ground with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground .
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced her gently when she was expecting her appearance - a pure form of form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collective book . &quot;
&quot; the achievement Ra@@ is@@ man was a ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke at Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team @-@ capitalism had called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; , &quot; a head start . &quot;
&quot; after its bottom exercise , she cast the audience to the audience , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes appeared without doubt . &quot;
&quot; concerning it , it has rapidly expanded the 19 @-@ year @-@ old T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ olds from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial case of music @-@ listening in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl was shot that were killed in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of series , while they were talking in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on 12 June while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator @-@ fired 8 shots from a hand@@ fire @-@ weapon , while he stood on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police told that the triple murder did not seem to be the result of a rob@@ bery , since the Att@@ acker did not count the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by an adult victims . &quot;
the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher von Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting of the investig@@ ator led the investig@@ ator to get a closer look at whether it is connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , predominantly in h@@ isp@@ anic settlements were killed in nine attacks seven people and two were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential neighborhood in front of a house , &quot; said Howard of K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects multiple vehicles used , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion , that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , has been hosp@@ it@@ alized due to their injury and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness of the police with that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting that had fallen onto a empty p@@ up truck for half an hour before the thre@@ e@@ up truck and assumed that it was the plant &apos;s work .
&quot; investig@@ ators found Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ancer , and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ olds loves Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his age enjoyed Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during her pregnancy didn &apos;t know anything . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time , my first thought , I won &apos;t . &quot;
I am not making it .
I did not let myself go .
&quot; what is not right at all -- of course , one has left behind it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and her was told that Ed@@ mund is able to recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to be institution@@ alized .
&quot; my first answer to it &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund is able to run with the help of a salary .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor kr@@ ab@@ bles until his third year of life and he can still not speak .
but he slowly makes progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play with his two brothers and sing .
Elizabeth shows the language that Ed@@ mund for &quot; Please sing me something about . &quot;
&quot; we bring him string , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical string -- says it . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as at Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as scam or the zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the lives of the ornam@@ ental avi@@ rus .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to is reminis@@ cent of the emotional price of an unknown future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still don &apos;t know .
I was no longer asked for the prognosis for a long time because I &apos;m not expecting them to really tell me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .

Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality had requested Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a ten thousand sand@@ bags alone .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ n@@ system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the Wetter@@ dienst let him be sound@@ able that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
in the south of Alab@@ ama was used on Friday a Fl@@ ut@@ breakfast system while in the area Mobile continues to rain .
&quot; the river Com@@ ite , near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite , close to Den@@ ham Springs , which both are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will be able to reach all probability after the weekend record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers could throw many houses in the curtains near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that the down@@ stream flood in Ascension Par@@ ish is a danger , as these were slowly flowing slowly into the Lake Mau@@ re@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w River , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;

&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and step@@ son were among those who were saved by bell on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , rose by night heavily . &quot;
he said that he would have warned him another step@@ son who lives nearby .
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and cur@@ sed , &quot; &quot; Han@@ ford said . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
&quot; Han@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that Not@@ hel@@ fer had saved all three in a major military truck and brought them to the next fire wake up in Glo@@ be where it was accommodated up to Friday .
&quot; Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood &quot; had quickly spread out , since it continued to be severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities have been contempl@@ ating evac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , an observer near Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;

&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , almost two Danish streets were set up due to the flood of water , and sand bags provided for residents who hope to hold the water out of their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last major floo@@ ding we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in the pp , the Emer@@ gency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it continues to be ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses had been reported on Thursday than flooded , but on Friday we have not been reported . &quot;

&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by bul@@ lets &quot; , &quot; survi@@ ves in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police shares with that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child will be shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave that Brown exp@@ elled several beats , including in the midst , leg , arm and belly , but that he was with his transport to hospital at consciousness . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , and divided his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transm@@ itter . &quot;
I can simply not believe that .
the state of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boys of the boy shared the transm@@ itter that he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
&quot; also , three men were killed : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
one of the 29 @-@ year old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in the stable state .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is located in a critical state , reports the transm@@ itter . &quot;
the other two victims were not found in the car and the police are determined whether under one of the injured men of the perpetrators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia with that it seems to have come to a Crus@@ fire between multiple sho@@ oters .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for storm @-@ pipes , which were re@@ pro@@ secuted to various stub@@ bor@@ es , mo@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a continual struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the wal@@ k@@ way , were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; in this way there seems to have been several armed fighters , who were actively involved in the police , the police forces of the police in Philadelphia with the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
&quot; there was no feast , and the police have been reviewed and report@@ edly reviewed the monitoring video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ year girl was hit by a Qu@@ ersch@@ d &apos;s arm when she played in front of her house in the residential neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she recovered and the police are still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ ic event and that is more than a reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer olymp@@ i@@ ade since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second , this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , inspiring for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the J@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the ca@@ tho@@ lic in is round off , makes every pride . &quot;
this team finally reflects the US .
it has solidi@@ fied the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one among the female turbine was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
in the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising Olympi@@ ad in America and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world championship in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tics rout@@ in@@ ers provided . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , a hetero@@ sexual American , who won gold at an individual multi @-@ session event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the top of this sport , but so do not see turn@@ outs throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie smote all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympics are only four tur@@ ner@@ ins in the crew . moreover , this is the last year with Marta Car@@ ol@@ yi . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like that Tur@@ nen can combine a more expensive sport and tur@@ ner in the first place in private turn@@ outs , which will be maintained by parents responsible for training , furnishing , travel and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list can be continued . &quot;
&quot; the majority of these trainers are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs , which can support the business . &quot;
&quot; in these verses , the Tur@@ ner will receive their entire training and this is a good and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer from Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we need to give the communities au@@ n countless , young girls that are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , enabling a high @-@ quality and easier access turn@@ able trainers . &quot;
I was founded my gym of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ fs in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality turbines , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; turbines develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits to health as well as for the school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team that bring thousands of young girls to care for the tur@@ nen , and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; through the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team Con@@ gol@@ ds and thank you , F@@ ass will be motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds in order to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistants would like to organise a further strike after Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts &apos;s proposal
&quot; the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes made by the adoption of a reform@@ ist contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ ,000 associates who vote for a vote declined . &quot;
&quot; in July Hun@@ t &apos;s plans revealed to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS were in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; , &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients were harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance should receive a new treaty , which contains changes to night and weekly contributions to improve care of un@@ successful movements . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A comb@@ i for assistance included the last night in a message with : &quot; assistance , in particular , that there will be the current availability crisis and administered it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks that still remain , until the first group of doctors under the new treaty will have to be made progress and time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve disputes through discussions have to take part in the government for res@@ entment and sometimes on de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this happened to the promise of a promise that Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had just made it last month , that his door would always be off@@ shoot . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t now has to act now to raise the penetration and address the concerns of the assistance .
&quot; if he should not do this , so there have been the assistance for assistance that they are ready to carry out further work amp@@ f@@ measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , since nur@@ ses and specialists were included to provide doctors on the strip post@@ ulates de@@ ton@@ ation . &quot;
the Ministers had hoped to end the dispute over the changes caused by adopting the reform@@ ist contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ wage payment for the 5@@ 4.000 assistance , which are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of N@@ HS employees , called for the assistance to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; work@@ work measures achieve nothing but little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing and their families only worried , distress and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we have spoken to the Com@@ miss@@ ary of assistance and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries , positively to concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and the W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wings . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , training , training holiday , and gender equality in medicine - a sign of how serious it was the employer , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning the compliance of agreements with BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per Tag@@ - medication which can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart attack are benef@@ itted from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to ad@@ minister this more people for a longer period of time .
the low @-@ minded medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a reduction of disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thus reducing the risk of a stroke , or another heart attack . &quot;
the regulatory body N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the regulatory body N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended for four years to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ 0.000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer a further heart attack , or a stroke . &quot;
heart attack and stroke will be caused by accum@@ ulations fatty fatty material in the arteries that are insul@@ ting .
&quot; when the flo@@ or@@ ning breaks apart , it can cause a blood stream that causes blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood flow is sol@@ ves , it can flow through the flow of blood and conce@@ de the flow of blood to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk to another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is manufactured by British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and is distributed under the trade name of Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ probable . &quot;
&quot; the draft design of N@@ ICE , which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health @-@ certification centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack may have considerable negative impact on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of other heart attack and stroke of people , who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; due to an interim recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or we are happy that we are able to expand available treatment options , thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the effectiveness and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the blood risk - is limited to a period of up to three years . the draft design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ital lets voting in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was released last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ ital has led to that more common constitu@@ ency in Muslim communities is kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored , as a crus@@ hing government report presented today . &quot;
&quot; the former cabinet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les attacks the police , Elec@@ tives and Rath@@ thu@@ gs to have ignored evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ cation and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , which is now a Ant@@ kor@@ rup@@ tion@@ alist , said that the intimi@@ dation of constitu@@ ents from religious motives would be so badly that it should be permitted by the police to set r@@ amp@@ r@@ ents outside of the constitu@@ ents to protect voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead an indication with him in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must give his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes not to write down ink at the finger of a person , when they give up their votes to prevent someone twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have more access to municipal facilities and decisions of non @-@ official compromise or working groups .
&quot; this not only serves campaigns , but is also the municipal government before the broader cor@@ rup@@ tions and financial culture in which it goes hand , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets franchise than in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the acting mayor of Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man should be contained in corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ is@@ sm@@ us@@ - and Islam@@ ophobia . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ man is supposed to have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the relative duty of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either undeni@@ able , or the result of a im@@ itation , for which one person chooses another as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that it would be no fraud across the country .
&quot; in particular , he spoke particularly alar@@ ming to frau@@ dul@@ ent brie@@ fing , when the older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the filling of out @-@ wise to prove the identity . &quot;
&quot; in his report it says , &quot; The evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the Will of El@@ der , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or ban@@ kers background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns , that ... state institutions such a behaviour due to &quot; politically correct &quot; persu@@ asions regarding the eth@@ ni@@ ers and religion did not kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including ban that political activ@@ ist stamps can be processed in order to re@@ ap &quot; re@@ ap . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tougher registration veri@@ fiers , in order to prevent the electoral list of immigration and social welfare purposes . &quot;
consider options before choosing to ask for your ID .
&quot; not remove ink at the finger of a person , once they released their voice to prevent someone twice . &quot;
systematic review on the nationality of a person perform to make sure they are either entitled .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic stamp @-@ election .
prohibition that political activists edit complete correspondence and covers of stamp @-@ elections .
the police give authority to set up votes for electoral stations .
a law modification made by an indictment because of intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representation Act 1983 ) .
photograp@@ hing @-@ in @-@ gy@@ ms .
requirement that only English may be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to make sure the staff usually assert that voters go alone into the cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric falls through the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no beam . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his replacement for the inter@@ rup@@ ting of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
it has been given due to a number of reasons for sufficiently - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings - guilty .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ ering &quot; of the Elec@@ trot@@ ter divisions of the Rath@@ geber .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court sur@@ ns in Tower Ham@@ lets from the last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments , but the worrying and covered spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Double @-@ split in and other famous double @-@ go@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio have turned this week over the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except edge and band that proved to be impressive doubled in the heart of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one , for gold fighting Ath@@ let , who has its own famous double @-@ go@@ ers - at least not , if you should believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; to honor the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces , which fli@@ mm@@ ers at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists of Olympi@@ icles , which have more than just a certain similarity with wood @-@ famous . &quot;
&quot; the hunters and the wolf : team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; apart from K@@ ates 1 million in the radar , a lot of people on the internet pointed out how a certain arch@@ ers of the Gem@@ ini from A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the U.S. team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ secretly . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the ins@@ anity in the social media with and gave to hear that he has already heard for his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big similarity , except the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I do it as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly step into the center : the awake similarity between the British Weit@@ ra Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ k Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina , with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should be passed as a double @-@ man for the Cub@@ an American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African swi@@ mmer Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one gear higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
another sustained comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mut who has similarly severe eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ a@@ ill@@ en@@ schwi@@ l of Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun @-@ born skin and bl@@ ond hair , like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne McC@@ ord , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy about it that others like the similarities also .
&quot; put theory in the room : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the similarity of the couple . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in stated its satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the US @-@ soccer star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar face @-@ form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons made from Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and their sm@@ iles , which is almost identical to the act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal at Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , which shows her own beautiful , big smile , which resembles the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the comment@@ ator B@@ yron Mac@@ Don@@ alds thought that his microphone is off , when he was at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ isti@@ ller put his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald that had been fet@@ ched into the comment@@ ator on board the C@@ BS in order to give more &apos; color &apos; , one could hear : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year China has lost the connection , Baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went off as M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ er in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming staff@@ el 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled it to leave the gap to China . &quot;
spectators in all Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Do@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Hat from the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year s@@ wimm@@ ers in China &quot; like a pig ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

the critic@@ isms of B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came fast and hard to put him in a lot of speech .
Twitter users did not look back when they heard how uns@@ ensi@@ bel B@@ yron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you can present the C@@ BC and Canada and let us look like rac@@ ists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC broadcast live , live for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said , &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a floating output . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy chosen wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ olog@@ ised at the end over 90 times in the people who responded to the comments about Twitter
the comment@@ ator @-@ mate Scott Rus@@ sel had to apologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
&quot; C@@ BC copies , and he added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
the network exc@@ uses quickly and gave us a message .
&quot; we regret it sincerely , that these statements were made and that it was made possible that it will be broad@@ cast@@ ed . &quot;
last night we quickly used for our spectators on the show and our Fol@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , B@@ yr@@ ons &apos;s comments related to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a miserable formulation . B@@ yron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald in the show and tried to justify his observation by saying that it was not his intention that it is not intended as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to apologi@@ ze for the comment I made for the comment squ@@ ad@@ rons in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ isen@@ yi , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have turned myself to the power of s@@ wimm@@ ers , and did not refer to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am sorry . &quot;
buyer in Pri@@ mark outra@@ ged about women who have ling@@ erie in the middle of business under@@ wear
&quot; the buyers did not know where to see , when a woman pulled her clothes in the midst of a pri@@ mark to test under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered how they saw it , she moved out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
she continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants before they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who had tried at the same time in the business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the shop , she took up a pair of under@@ pants from the output , attracted its own shr@@ ink@@ le and pants , and tried them . &quot;
she didn &apos;t even try to find a slightly more discreet place to do it - she simply stood there just like O@@ sk@@ ar .
&quot; each star@@ ing , when she pulled off the under@@ pants , that you obviously did not like , since they put them on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that you dropped nothing again and went out again .
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b them that they observe someone - or about the person who would like to buy the under@@ pants , who had tried them . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; as contradic@@ tory to think that someone would take shelter with home , who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have taken in , the staff is trying to pull the garments of sale after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had joined them and did not have been washed away .
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the case that occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question have been sold out of sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms protection
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ des in New York to find out how to circum@@ navigate with armed rob@@ bers . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether one approaches you from the front or from the back , this video will show you how you turn to your inc@@ ense . &quot;
&quot; if one turns out from the back , then you should turn around as an up@@ turn , so that you can see your att@@ acker and go out of the line , &quot; &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you face it with your free el@@ bows to face .
&quot; then hit him with the knee to the gro@@ in and rot@@ ate , while the Att@@ acker sp@@ ake off pain , the gun out of his hands . beat it with the run into the face and move back as they judge the weapon upon him . &quot;
&quot; at Att@@ acker that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the stream , take the weapon and rot@@ ate it , so that the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; simultaneously shift the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker to the chest , then turn the weapon out of its grip before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon to him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it does Miz@@ ra@@ chi &apos;s preference .
&quot; but remember that there is a smo@@ b at the safest , your money - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian Wright sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the most dirty locations in Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ ordin@@ ated his immune system and lit@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x of a serious test - by getting some of the dirty and most rudi@@ mentary places of Europe .
&quot; moder@@ ator and Travel @-@ author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ off his course on an Euro @-@ Sch@@ ein , a rail@@ ing in Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sin@@ king button , and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of its immune system . &quot;
&quot; in front of the no@@ cking of each object , he used a le@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the flush @-@ ch@@ ool of a traction toi@@ lette , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely removable , but actually in a kitchen rin@@ se more bad bacteria . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright talked to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately left nothing , what he d@@ ded , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright has been known to test the resili@@ ence of his intest@@ ines by travelling through the world , and ate great things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to r@@ ins@@ ing sk@@ id of res@@ tro@@ oms , the task applied its immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; he told me : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns , and I put all kinds of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and s@@ lu@@ ent . &quot;
in film he definitely did justice to his reputation .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
its trial line showed a le@@ umin@@ ous number of over 4000 units .
&quot; compared to that , the le@@ umin@@ ometer is made of fresh hands less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to cut off after their le@@ umin@@ ous number over 4000 units was , while freshly caught hands one of less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o produced the travel agent &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; That comes to the worst that I have ger@@ ent in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing of mut@@ in@@ ous than that !
&quot; I will do nothing here , because it is in@@ doors here . &quot;
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products vali@@ o .
&quot; the company accused Mr. Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ d Senior Venice President for snacks , juices and new categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says , &quot; We wanted to offer the consumer something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of probiot@@ ics .
we carried crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings by saying that we told &quot; L@@ ass us Ian to call us Ian .
they claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information about an interesting manner .
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the direction of the film , added : &quot; let it say to me - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he would like some of the things I have reli@@ ant on , like the ek@@ el@@ ective Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was simpler to bring Ian to join them and others in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
&quot; glad , that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film . &quot;
&quot; in one of Vali@@ o conducted survey conducted in 2015 , 84 percent of all respondents l@@ actic acid bacteria , particularly with the well @-@ being of the stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said that they may use at least occasionally products used to l@@ actic l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ Social Family destroyed in front of Del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication &apos;s welfare in S@@ alt@@ ash . Corn@@ wall
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment according to a del@@ usion with a damage of £ 50,000 because they had terrorist their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash . Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after having rolled power out of their property , the property of the apartment co@@ oper@@ atives found the property in a irre@@ par@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls were aff@@ licted holes , wooden di@@ mp@@ s were cleared up , garbage was disper@@ sed on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was pen@@ ed to the walls . &quot;
the family were hu@@ gged and it is thought that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment is no longer being repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people will not have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property will probably be seen as a beautiful part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is it too .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the apartment and the police said that the terror that inf@@ inf@@ licted the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ asleep , intimi@@ dation by residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ ams , streams and floods . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which under circumstances will be demol@@ ished , old trash was found . &quot;
&quot; there were were tra@@ ded in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight on the streets and had to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing har@@ ass@@ ed her and her partner this week ex@@ ited by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer out .
the del@@ usion were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; they turned around anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years along with them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are amazing . &quot;
&quot; today , we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed to !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have been ad@@ orable to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police was set up at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the community house the garbage dump and old toys have been cast down
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a shame that there was a shame to take any responsibility for their behavior and their family as a del@@ ity is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot;
that was a very difficult case since the behaviour was extremely and their deeds had to be terrible for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have gr@@ ace@@ ful to us and have provided us with the information . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this development will be sol@@ ace in some neighbours , and the message conve@@ ys that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons have lived in the house at different times , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a fil@@ thy mattress , separated in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication on the ground . &quot;
workers in the house administration are now being exposed to rub@@ b@@ lossom and the house is surrounded by rub@@ b@@ lossom .
&quot; in 2014 the police conducted a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash at the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was given a penalty after they had found themselves guilty of the possession of a drug @-@ class B in commercial supervision .
&quot; she claimed that money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , which occurred in 2013 by an automobile accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and their partner now live in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were rewarded with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they will be ten@@ ant , who do not hold up to the house order &quot;
Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ fication had a clear warning to the other tenants who do not keep themselves to the house order .
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ being , as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate a criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

Donald Tr@@ ump Sp@@ t ″ enormous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states their majority . &quot;
&quot; presidential assistant Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg , Utah . &quot;
&quot; a rare moment , in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ aire has vo@@ iced something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within the own Republi@@ can camp , the doubt now grow his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians , whom he asked for support in important federal states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; the guilt of false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he returned to his well @-@ known media . &quot;
Republi@@ can skyscrapers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey of Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his subject was written by the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tr@@ ump in front , but not by the distance that can be common for Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered there are also Arizona and Georgia .
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied on the question , as he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ ton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and whether back , I will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he does not make anything else than &quot; the truth to tell .
&quot; if there is no rich in order for him at the end of the political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press report , the party Tr@@ ump should have threatened with funds to support his election , should he be able to present no better change values . &quot;
instead of what the re@@ public@@ ans of the Re@@ public@@ ans call for Congress to become stronger among the arms .

Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics is threatened after the second D@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer for home . &quot;

&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today &apos;s Coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , passed a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I . &quot;
this is the team direction K@@ eni@@ as reported by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the event in order to assess their own investigations , shared a IA@@ AF speaker . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will make a review , it was called the IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ c@@ rah ) has gone to the dop@@ ing control station , and has been issued as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ I , the sample and signed , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as Chief de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was owned by the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .

&quot; the anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing Act and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; subsequently , the W@@ ada Kenya took away from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing fight against the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is considered a big runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .

and then Mary would be her personality .
&quot; she says it in her song , &quot; I feel pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; therefore it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very , my Italian character I have seen as a ro@@ ot@@ in , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli &quot; . &quot; &quot;

diver@@ ting is for him a necessity .
&quot; you see it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .

Turkey : Kurdish parish counts with mass cur@@ sed
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , &quot; says the end of the Gü@@ len @-@ near Stiftung Dialogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kurdish municipality of Germany counts as short @-@ term shelter , who are fle@@ dged from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundreds of thousands , &quot; the association &apos;s chairman Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; because of the hard working of the Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish municipality of Germany expects a mass cur@@ sed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice , I reck@@ on ten thousand @-@ thousand prot@@ esters from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime is fighting the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government already passed cur@@ ative strongh@@ olds with imp@@ acting , be 500,000 Kurds in Turkey on the run . &quot;
after the eit@@ ed coup still secular and op@@ position@@ ists are added .
many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be oppressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that even takes refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ber@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the association was compl@@ ained by the targeted settlement of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
thus Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the extinction shift to the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been wi@@ ped out or distributed over the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
&quot; the association called for the German government to stand sharply as sharply as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and its followers . &quot;
also in Germany a &quot; Wit@@ nesses hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan &apos;s critics took place .
I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time in the last few months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement is also feared the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , mainly the Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ trailer destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed caffeine , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and se@@ cul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ related Foundation dialogue and education , the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reports on appeal to the figures of the Federal Ministry of Justice , the Turks already set the biggest group in front of the coup for political persecution in Germany . &quot;
&quot; on the date of 30 June , this 11.@@ 386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all have been authorized as asylum ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , not those can be found before war , poverty or perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum entitled to the Basic Law are exclusively political , so by the state of state , individually per@@ secuted . &quot;

&quot; for bl@@ ending up until now it is not : summer holidays , heat and country @-@ day @-@ war @-@ war - that is all . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced by the voters are on vacation .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are no locals , so may not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems occur : in the holidays are hel@@ pers , the posters infl@@ atable , fl@@ or@@ ons , fl@@ yers and exp@@ ire at the end of the voices , only lab@@ ev@@ oll . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the election and the last day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to go ahead once again in its election in just under the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say that at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 the strongest party , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; thrilling is exciting , how strong new@@ com@@ er @-@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ enable . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 chief president , makes an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive electoral campaign , one sees from his big pl@@ aten . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , distributed ro@@ ses and ch@@ del@@ etes a little with the people , as it was already his legendary wor@@ t@@ kar@@ st predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise Se@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blo@@ om of the African D .
&quot; her refugee policy , you &quot; We create this &quot; have accelerated the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top edge data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the wrong time at the right place of campaign . &quot;
she has invited twice the chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel on major subjects ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag in the north @-@ east is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group had not agreed , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in the N@@ DR . &quot;
but it too bad has anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U obstruc@@ ted largely on the usual electoral campa@@ igning on market positions and in front of m@@ alls with umbrellas and ballo@@ ons .
&quot; that , so co@@ co@@ ert , play only a &quot; sub@@ ordinate roll . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country its base has de@@ ple@@ ted away , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are like the left , the SPD , the Greens , the Greens of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U vote Kok@@ ert at his fellow @-@ stre@@ ak is also self @-@ exposed : &quot; they have to go to where it hur@@ ts , namely , where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is a lot in the game , Sell@@ ering has called its SPD to a particularly committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the age of Af@@ for@@ age ( 19 ) . &quot;
in the election in 2011 the SPD was still clearly obtained with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) .
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls , should raise the leap into the day of the country . &quot;
they make a modern virtue from the holiday @-@ need and reloc@@ ate to the internet .
&quot; online @-@ campaign , &quot; calls it the member of the president Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green franchise at Sp@@ age @-@ search for native voice can be found among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top can@@ did@@ atin , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ ian lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; their impression : &quot; &quot; holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ rehabilitation : guest plants suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed , with which the B 27 is refurbished , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction of the building work , which begin at 5.@@ 30 o &apos;clock in the morning and finish it only at 20 o &apos;clock , there is plenty of praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything rather z@@ ag , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff of the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is also no de@@ duction .
&quot; the construction site could be moved on the weekend to the half @-@ time plan@@ ters to the South , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ used is also praised for the construction of the building , for example when it comes to setting up accommodation . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site on Monday to south , and also the block of asphalt road in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was abolished and also the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has been restored , the traffic situation in the village has relaxed . &quot;
now the citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 again .
wast@@ ing traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there was partly considerable complaints , &quot; said the leader responsible for the managing director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ n@@ straße , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many s@@ add@@ les were looking for and more their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to man@@ cher trucks in residential areas .
&quot; the speed limit is not observed , the community called for the measuring aircraft from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable consideration , &quot; says King , who turned himself on the spot over the situation . &quot;
&quot; here , two to three per minute has been blown off . &quot;
the fastest was with 77 hour @-@ kilometres at the pace @-@ 30 zone .
&quot; since the construction site is further moved , but it became qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a small con@@ sol@@ ation that is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
business people do not like to look at cards .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ refurb@@ ishment has led to them to increase in sales , everyone lets you look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; , &quot; i.e. for other companies , for whom it hardly has any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also during the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum of slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also that of course , the run@@ way is missing . &quot;
the most exploited are the restaurants along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have made it hard . &quot;
&quot; the customers were lacking from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we need to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; the revenue of revenue is based on &quot; &quot; far over 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the road @-@ restoration took its operation &quot; &quot; two years back . &quot; &quot; &quot;
half of his staff have to release them .
if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dis@@ missed the policy would have responded differently .
&quot; instead , government president Jörg Schmidt placed upon a request of G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference to the restaurant , the restaurant also benefited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 now , it also has the draw@@ backs that carry out through the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where so much gener@@ ously been tra@@ ded .
&quot; in all sections , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been settled since 17@@ 15 , it refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; any other regul@@ ars can now be subject to less frequently , because of complicated transport technology . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot drive , it is also somewhere nice . &quot;
&quot; that his head @-@ kli@@ fts returned after the end of the re@@ development , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt about it . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction work on its clients for the greatest crisis that has experienced a restaurant in its long@@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now publishes a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a trigger status with terror to be done ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ th@@ ors say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conci@@ liation .
&quot; all his proposals are &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; says the Minister of Defense at the presentation of his new security pact . &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
&quot; others , additional points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
&quot; in other words , I would like to go to myself . &quot;
&quot; but the Minister of Interior , however , is located on results and at a &quot; &quot; retreat @-@ reaching consensus &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach , after the recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority to handle the ball co@@ ded communication is not new . &quot;
&quot; also , not the fact that Germany has to transp@@ ose several EU guidelines to air passenger data and arms law . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is also not surprising .
&quot; partly , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second call for proposals which have not been able to do with the SPD : he wants to place sympath@@ isers for terrorist groups under punishment and crack jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; they will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; he still consider this to be reasonable and demanding nothing , what I don &apos;t have any chances in co @-@ operation . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère too .
these are partly in itself : he plans to shift the de@@ port@@ ations for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted into the country should check their smartphone and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; at D@@ ul@@ ties for past asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse still worse than until now - about those who commit crimes or raise their papers to conce@@ de their identity . &quot;
some of them is politically and legally healed .
some still works un@@ exploited and leaves questions open .
&quot; and at some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of thought , for example - is the question : what does that have to do with certainty and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks were from Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg &apos;s refugees .
&quot; moreover , many people were worried about the high refugees concerned about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that people are deeply concerned , could not cling in the election times even in the election times . &quot;
internal security is huge in focus .
&quot; the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the security is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking position on the issue of internal security .
in the last days between the two parties went high .
&quot; only a gar@@ den@@ ger dispute over the equipment of the federal police , then via a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ interior , in which the Ress@@ orts also demand a bur@@ ka ban and a return of the double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère also lab@@ elled here at some conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
&quot; apart from a return from the double pass , he is nothing . &quot;
we have been watching the discussion in Germany .
new to be re@@ inst@@ ated is not useful .
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether his own package is constitu@@ ent at all corners and whether it actually is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ an partners , you have to show itself . &quot;
there is a lot of things that could worry about .
&quot; however , the SPD is still trying to profile itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized first time with willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increase security further . &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p will come through .
despite diesel technology the pay@@ lines rise worldwide .
but not in all markets it is running around .
&quot; in retrosp@@ ection , there is vor@@ tex around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts with the deliveries in the second half @-@ year .
&quot; with its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , the biggest car@@ makers can continue to advance a plus in the previous year due to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW mainly found in Western Europe and poll@@ uted with it again the total sales , as mentioned in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; the brand &apos;s VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent less cars than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe , to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year . &quot;
in the home @-@ market Germany sealed the deliveries around almost a six@@ ties .
br@@ anding Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weak@@ est figures from July mainly on two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there have been in some core markets by &quot; changing economic conditions &quot; a tra@@ int . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the UK vote also deb@@ ited from the EU , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhau@@ sts first escal@@ ate first , there is also a minus one to be@@ ech . &quot;
big pillar for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the mainly affected house mark of the Lower Saxony is anyway further linked by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , there is only a reduction of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
consolidated leader Fred Kap@@ pler managed to advance a sales split from January to July .
&quot; 1.3 percent more cars delivered Volkswagen in this period , around 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software absorption .
VW around 2.5 million vehicles for re@@ armament in the workshops .
&quot; in the course of the re@@ armament , VW reiter@@ ated that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ armament of the vehicles there are no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the pay@@ er point to the customer after the change@@ over , &quot; &quot; guaranteed &quot; &quot; certificate , but I do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; reason are legal instruments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported , Volkswagen granted its German customers now a guarantee of constant diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed the last Monday VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the traffic Department , it confirmed that there was a meeting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; VW has the conditions of my investig@@ ator and the KBA complete . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from these are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after the change@@ over no deterior@@ ations take place and all type of vehicle &apos;s values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not , as was the name of the company . &quot;
&quot; the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; provides Volkswagen the possibility that customers can come back to a workshop for example a half year after the upgrade to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in customer interest , it is important to avoid that there is any other damage to do with any other damage , which is nothing to do with the sc@@ andal with regard to any warranty arrangements , as it was called . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from wealthy de@@ posit@@ ors in future for criminal interest - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Prof. Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on po@@ stage or day @-@ cash accounts . &quot;
the Bundes@@ verband German banks speaks of an individual case and does not fores@@ ee a signal : normal austerity would have to be feared to pay for their austerity criminal law .
bearings banks money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) they must pay their 0.@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties .
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of over 100,000 euros at g@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ cash accounts .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in future 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been around 40 million euros , which could be raised from one day to the other and which he could not be able to evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they are with me in the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent cost , &quot; said the bank chief . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay for every million 4000 Euros . &quot; &quot; &quot;
he will now give the costs after the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; the cash simply to be seen in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank , would be far too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four assault , I like not yet the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; the bank@@ note said . &quot;
most of the customers had an understanding and changed to other investment forms .
only a few migr@@ ated to other banks .
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria stated : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; you are alone to wear , be &quot; &quot; economical permanently not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gia Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger land had made headlines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , main business leaders of the banking association , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits in deposits , so the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , on T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a cliff that is equipped with the property somewhat lav@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , if they pay for free money . &quot;
&quot; the 1911 @-@ established cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gladly , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
in the region live well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; the cooperative association of Bavaria &quot; is currently not known for further banks which charge an out@@ fit for deposits of private customers , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the president of the German Association of German People &apos;s banks and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained the end of June : &quot; the threshold , to the negative , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it dro@@ pping migration from investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany do not like to please the width in the width .
destination sheets : who does not buy sound plates ?
lonely men middle ages love records .
&quot; before you move to the commentary box , in order to ski@@ pped it under the pseudon@@ ym non @-@ sam@@ ic men with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the widespread revival of sound plates did not want to greet a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the novel@@ ty of physical objects but on Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who have recently purchased a record are all pre @-@ view at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer Group . &quot;
it is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables retain their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it alone time to spend ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but agree the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o @-@ e , a modest gray suit and wild , before I ste@@ al , my hands keep , and something determin@@ ative as : &quot; so , let &apos;s have a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos is slowly in his charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops . &quot;
&quot; I would ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part , where I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , which I received by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle aged ) to the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men middle ages , a woman , presumably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , question I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I already appreciate , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; this sound plates , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I am not followed immediately ) , dress up the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of its available income : he is now able to buy panels that he was unable to afford , when they appeared and again articles , which he sold , when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I Buy are from the late 1960s , early 70@@ ies , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy the sheets , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and adds : &quot; I smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 that works with S@@ ister Ray , believes also that many customers that he meets on the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , who have heard about the com@@ eback and have prompted to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually do so by 1998 or in 1999 of their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell their CDs to buy their records now , &quot; he says . &quot;
that would explain the boom to tra@@ ilers of a specific age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to recognize that record stores a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to the WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the out@@ going payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound sl@@ ats , of objects , the happy ju@@ gen@@ der@@ inn@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
that is with me as a collector and I think it &apos;s so with many people .
it is a simple way to mentally engaged .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ utes an employee from a record stack . &quot;
&quot; a survey of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who have bought a record last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , do not have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the report report , I would probably look very worried while at the stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works with sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle age ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of the Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone only came here clean and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead Schall@@ plate so that I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more product @-@ hand , less musi@@ c@@ anti@@ le . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , who only slowly come . &quot;
&quot; stop that has devoted the gram@@ ophone almost a whole floor , has a b@@ oured audience , when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women middle aged . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest synthes@@ iz@@ er- and sex@@ c@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz , from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity with the customer . &quot;
&quot; none of them sees strange , but na@@ ve mental trau@@ mas are difficult to set when you stand next to someone 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variation of the plates that are available for sale . &quot;
it is more likely to get a shop p@@ add@@ um@@ mel as a large purchase .
&quot; she does not deserve much , so the collector of plates does not have a real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is ... it drives with a loved si@@ gh .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a shop , which is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired : urban out@@ f@@ itters . &quot;
&quot; while I may give the impression to mu@@ ck the jeans @-@ hot@@ ly , I observed a group of young te@@ amm@@ ers who group themselves for a moment to buy pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and daughter to think about a cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative , some as far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
but considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money to the sector and some customers could send to the depths of so@@ hos for more so there is nothing to complain .
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most for luxury items such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my research took place that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they let , at least in record business in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors and records , which exist in reality , record business and online @-@ for@@ ks . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through records of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaf through plates , while they avoid the rigid view of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old moder@@ ator , that prot@@ ru@@ des nothing to the shoulders of the middle aged men . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects the offer of demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French Court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; a court hearing this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais that the state should be authorised to plu@@ ck 72 provisional business , in which persons within the camp goods , selling cigarettes until En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 pers ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be crus@@ hed , because they would represent a parallel economy , which no taxes would be paid and that a fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important as the free meals offered by the stat@@ ely supported association and other groups , not sufficient food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they led out that the provisional stores and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there was no legal basis for expul@@ sion of people who operate 72 Pro@@ visional businesses , but spati@@ ally be that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely understandable . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that food shops , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café des camp , which is hosted and 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0@@ ,000 people have signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years old are . &quot;
&quot; the two aid agencies Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge of the Migr@@ ants made on Friday , that the number of people in the jungle camp has risen to more than 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new arrivals over the summer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed measurements : in various federal states , among other things in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flash devices are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ h is especially effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ acting En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used for instance at random score , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to sandy bridges with temporary tem@@ per , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure the speed limit there with a stationary leaf . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile design can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery holds five days , the case data is encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can be recorded across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limit , as well as the driving distance to time , driving strip and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
in the state @-@ driven state it is possible to move the p@@ endant according to manufacturer with each car with a p@@ endant cl@@ utch .
&quot; so that it is not easy to folded , he is in the measure , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and by the way also fade away out@@ ward out@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the bl@@ itzer from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for data from Vit@@ ronic in various federal states has been tested and is now also used . &quot;

Britain fet@@ ches Silver in 7 @-@ star Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by arrived in the final hur@@ dle last Thursday , at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were beaten here with a result of 43 @-@ 7 in the De@@ posit Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji em@@ divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line up and ro@@ her strength to win gold - her first olymp@@ ic wa@@ ist of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was promised by the not too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Great Britain in this day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament in which they hit New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the strong defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could fall back to it in the finals . &quot;
&quot; however , no matter how Fi@@ ji should have done a 15 @-@ man team in the form of this form . &quot;
it could be an con@@ sol@@ ation for UK - but it &apos;s probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite tomorrow will have a gold medal to hang his neck : fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former head for England from Wimbledon . &quot;
UK had a difficult path behind him .
eight years ago she lost at Ry@@ an every game in Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this cap is we@@ d@@ ging , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and let the attacks GB@@ s from fun exhau@@ sts .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell , and Co. at , as if you were walking in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 to the top , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au finished in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with still four minutes of playing , Jerry Tu@@ wai has yet another attack from the right corner , which he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly ob@@ serves the ball .
a h@@ ash twe@@ eter of Mitchell stopped the mountain of Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa a third gate to achieve but it has just stopped Fi@@ ji .
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch @-@ down and it was 0 @-@ 17 for the UK .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the Re@@ an@@ p@@ fi@@ ff and there was still over a minute of time ... in the first half .
&quot; V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u presses through further weak tactics of the UK team , and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate . &quot;
the conversion was a 29 @-@ 0 to the rest .
&quot; it is like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while the UK is still being da@@ unting . &quot;
that is how it is .
&quot; GB resulted in basic changes to the mid @-@ time period and closed the fi@@ ji@@ ian gap ... for whole four minutes , what was fine for the conditions of the first half times , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova went after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt on the UK , made a touch@@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favour of the Southern German sul@@ aner , whose fans s@@ anders , flags and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the i @-@ icing on a further attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the P@@ fi@@ ff ert@@ ank , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced and GB ki@@ cked off in the lawn . &quot;
previously on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had defeated in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a cris@@ p @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and achieved a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant more late tac@@ it by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer for the rowing eg .
there will be no em@@ o@@ aler@@ es gold than with these games and that is what will be called .
&quot; from the first rowing precip@@ itation to the last , 220 harsh H@@ ieve , who found in history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional significance in her golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat on the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ u@@ bi@@ ased when she ru@@ gged the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without tax lady in a row , the first women in the history of British Sports , who used such a standard . &quot;
&quot; their dominance was absolutely , after all its 3@@ 9.@@ ter imp@@ aired application , which is also unparall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ lon who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of spon@@ ge , which does not reflect the nature of the Arc de Tri@@ om@@ p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the rowing , there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of wil@@ low hel@@ pers that make the difference to the difference , and it was nobody any more than the trainer who would not survive the difference 30 months ago if he was diagnosed this day at all when cancer was diagnosed . &quot;
as he said he was risky .
&quot; I had blasph@@ emy that is operated in a run , and that they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a little bit of view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , could start which the interruption kept to a minimum if this is at all the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go back soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would meet . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ dying morning thus spent something more than usual and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an operation in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that &apos;s maybe something extremely interesting , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repeated only how much I mean , how much I and Helen , and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thanks to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have a better person for exercising or a better coach .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race in the last five years .
the pair had a hard rhythm with whom their opponents were not able to keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had a lot in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught in the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let go with .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something Tol@@ les .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works , we simply wanted to get a good result , going out and win the race which we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding with her own with the TV adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall .
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that my last race was .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to comprehend that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new to me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the water @-@ purpose &quot; V@@ eit@@ ed @-@ group &quot; , &quot; R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes into retirement . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian , &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ame@@ ful drinking water @-@ purpose combined as a role model for the large water producers .
it was the name of some time ago in the original painting in a report by Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of sub@@ fran@@ ken embr@@ aced the two @-@ time association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ eit@@ ed @-@ group &quot; &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; &quot; has been exemplary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the two @-@ bound staff , which was 28 years old as managing director . &quot;
he was now reti@@ re at the age of 65 in retirement .
&quot; drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ ch @-@ group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of latitude , promotes about 150@@ 000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and past@@ ors with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member communities are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , latitude , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ah . &quot;
for further towns and villages there is water supply agreements .
&quot; the current chair , latitude in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler 1985 was appointed as water@@ wart and was appointed as Managing Director of the Second Association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance work on office and organizational activities , the bud@@ ding position , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency rates at weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , they called the commissioning and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , property purchases in the field of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the re@@ establishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , and the divisions of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no stal@@ em@@ ate and I have always recorded any new additions because water lives and pot@@ able water is the most important food .
&quot; in their Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o , she praised her faithful , reliable and accurate service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he has worked for the water @-@ purpose verband , as if it would be his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , he was a real practitioner to present the success concept of the V@@ eit@@ ing group to the nit@@ rate of the district sub@@ fran@@ ken outside the water forum . &quot;
he received a great deal of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler s@@ well praised water@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons Greek who worked with him 28 years .
he is the best water of water and he was a faithful kno@@ b .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as high points from his point of view , he described the fountain structure and the re @-@ structured of the purpose . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the hardest use were the pipe @-@ break at the high @-@ container at the col@@ der at a 3rd January . &quot;
&quot; here we had to work with minus 17 degrees all night , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of Neu@@ brunn at once again can only be maintained , because one filled the high container of p@@ ett@@ stadt with tu@@ bing . &quot;
the management of drinking water @-@ purpose was handed over to Daniel storms of Lau@@ ter who enters the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .
&quot; the sop@@ rano Anna Net@@ reb@@ ko is open with the autism of her son Ti@@ ago - and turns to other affected parents : &quot; they must have the courage to speak about it . &quot;

&quot; the man has called and stated with us to have shot his partner , &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ tend . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him I will be publi@@ ci@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , as Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown , and has a lat@@ ch . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
it is a couple of years old .
meanwhile the man has a lat@@ ch .
the man should not be addressed directly .
he could still carry the weapon with him so the police .
&quot; who Sven S. sees , is supposed to call the 110 . &quot;
the police speak of a &quot; relationship material . &quot;
&quot; the victim was vintage , 1988 , the perpetrators of 1981 . &quot;
&quot; the official police in Lü@@ beck , first of all , wanted to do no information about the per@@ imeter or the relationship between the perpetrators and the victims ; but it confirmed that a man had been killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing . &quot;
&quot; more we say not currently , &quot; said a poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ tend in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses therefore was a special value command ( SE@@ K ) at the scene .
steel - light view for German steel industry
the cro@@ codi@@ fied and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million@@ aire @-@ height .
financial stresses that threaten the industry from the oil extraction system are from the table .
&quot; it remain with the liberation from the renewable energy supply to the so @-@ called self @-@ electricity production in the German steel industry , &quot; said Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I am really happy that we were able to finally reach negotiations after two years . &quot;
&quot; the European Commission was initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer , the gases for use from the ho@@ cho@@ p to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the industry industry , the steel industry remains at an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , it now give a key@@ note certificate with the EU Commission after talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only when the alternat@@ ors are replaced in the steel works , in case of an EEG transfer of 20 percent . &quot;
but even this will not be raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the unification of Germany with the European Commission for de@@ hydr@@ ation creation .
&quot; with this , the status quo of the current regulation will be largely fixed . &quot;
special meaning have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more need to follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; also with the reform of the emissions legal system , climate and employment targets are considering , IG Metall manager Jörg Hof@@ mann declared in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in Europe , the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
last year the situation exac@@ erb@@ ated more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China given the weak@@ ened local demand for mass steel on the world market .
European producers throw Chinese steel @-@ compliant price @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; for one showing the import duties on imported goods , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have gone up . &quot;
unclear how sustainable the pricing is still unclear .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
&quot; finally , the prices would have more st@@ agn@@ ant again . &quot;
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
the Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p also did not want to exclude the closing of individual works .
&quot; in the German steel industry , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain cautious despite increasing prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tons , they produced more than six percent less crude steel compared to the previous year , such as the economic association steel by Friday . &quot;
after a short increase in May the set quantity went back to the second month in the second month .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is about two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
the association counts in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation with an increasing impetus .
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing seniors good &quot;
&quot; the singing has accompanied UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp already accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , at the mag@@ ister@@ ium study she won the F@@ ach Music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; describes them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample they feel balanced , cheerful and overall living , she says . &quot;
&quot; in the next door , they are doing something good about their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; since S@@ ingen is the same from several perspectives , a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior League . &quot;
&quot; most seniors singing in chor@@ us and share with like @-@ minded people &apos;s joy in music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular meetings , seniors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often , social and familiar structures solve the age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
this experience has also made UR@@ SE@@ L Ki@@ pp in their choir : to speak and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together .
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense means H@@ ac@@ kler .
for doing so you are practicing a deep and controlled breathing .
&quot; whoever calls on his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age , S@@ ingen is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people S@@ ingen has often a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz of the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors and senior organisations . &quot;
&quot; in older generations the joint venture had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure . &quot;
&quot; l@@ enz frequently ob@@ serves that singing or hearing of songs with older people aw@@ akes many memories , often associated with positive emotions of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially melodies , even the ill @-@ ill will be denied . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head will also require a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
to focus simultaneously on your own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice alone , do not just focus on yourself . &quot;
another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the chor@@ us means H@@ ac@@ kler .
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
&quot; also , self @-@ esteem is growing through singing in the chor@@ us . &quot;
&quot; to show yourself : if I &apos;m long for something , I will better and grow over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , betra@@ ys L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - at 50 sin@@ king people , who list@@ ens to you , when a note goes next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , seniors have various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior or@@ ench@@ y@@ ma , you can just join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views over choirs in the area .
who wants to sing in an ec@@ clesi@@ astic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church &apos;s Church .
many seniors can also be found via the internet .
&quot; who do not have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ cher@@ che . &quot;
&quot; who desire to sing , should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;

bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the rep@@ ut@@ ations of fel@@ ic@@ ys on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise the males also did not let the males go cold - however , they kept themselves in the difference to the females always . &quot;
female cats can recognize the arousal level of kittens on the Mi@@ xing of the Small Ones .
they react to ten percent faster to the age of kittens resulting in great distress as scientists from the veterinary University and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
K@@ ater also react to the rep@@ ut@@ ations of kittens - but always equal .
&quot; clearly , the acoustic differences between the che@@ wing of less and strong reg@@ aining for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of meaning &quot; , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
it is first author@@ itative study published on this Friday in the mag@@ azin &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team already found out that the duration and key @-@ height of the kittens with the urgency of their help is different . &quot;
a total of nine adult men and eight que@@ ens from the animal management of the MH@@ H were observed .
they were used for a pack of little ones who were taken from the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ ams of more intense kit@@ ten who were additionally lifted up . &quot;
the researchers maintain their results despite the low sample sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had its own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
she turned faster to the loud@@ speaker when this herd of the very sublime kit@@ ten .
this ability may be linked or develop@@ ped with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men on baby @-@ noise . &quot;
&quot; also , some studies showed that women re@@ acted sensitive to infants , whether they were already mothers or not , reported the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina She@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski takes place with &quot; gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
in Turkey against the deserted soccer star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r has been issued an arrest warrant .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , in Turkey a major soccer game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
in front of the Du@@ el of the Arch@@ bishop between Col@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as well . &quot;
&quot; even when a state of emergency after the crash test in July , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ hes should not be imp@@ aired . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those who are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; thereby , even before the football does not stop . &quot;
against the former Star@@ ki@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r the pro@@ secutor made an arrest warrant .
&quot; according to this , the South kis@@ sed group is now being thrown into America as a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; South kis@@ ses shall be adher@@ ents of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible by the President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan for the coup . &quot;
&quot; true , initially for 90 days of emergency , it is still valid until October , in fact this has been on the life of the majority of the Turks but as good as no impact . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guard &quot; on public places across the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end .
the sport is - like the whole country - split in trailer and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; clubs are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
what the group@@ s of the Turks but in view of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - whether their heart is propos@@ ing to Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or visits .
at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; gala &quot; it will be especially back on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski .
&quot; his sporting value , the Köl@@ ner in the past season showed proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ year ended his first time as Top@@ scor@@ er of his association . &quot;
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he obtained the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ ffer .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the place .
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team to the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; &quot; the disappointing season for the record master was an irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also went out early in the Europe League . &quot;
in the southern per li@@ g there was only to rank six .
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; this we made and that is the most important , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master visits , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who is with 26 season op@@ ets as ad@@ per @-@ li@@ g @-@ go@@ al@@ kö@@ nig the base for the 14th title . &quot;
that is also the reason that the fans further hope to return the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; the Gom@@ ez , under the contract standing at the AC Florence , had only been borrowed after the coup attempt to return to Putin &apos;s political situation , because of the political situation in the country after his EM holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario however wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club of Fi@@ cre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the falls should be ready to ren@@ oun@@ ce around a third of his to 7.5 million euros estimated to be clear : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence we can not pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes have many medals at Olympia in Rio , &quot;
the 34 @-@ year J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others o@@ iled Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ th@@ le@@ tics @-@ sinners can only laugh - they are fighting in Rio for medals .
&quot; the subject of dop@@ ing , still determines the headlines from the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
&quot; the Russian swimming pool in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing sper@@ re shortly before the games , was bl@@ un@@ ned at its start ( 100 meter chest ) mer@@ c@@ un@@ ed and booked . &quot;
it was a sc@@ ur@@ ri@@ le scenery : with a set sm@@ iles she was still proud in the hall and had prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; first , that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a j@@ ubil@@ ant tower . &quot;
&quot; but there are still many more athletes , who are going to start at the start despite D@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the controversial figures in the athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was imprisoned two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the olymp@@ ic event of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before , it is more than 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest challenge of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ bility and si@@ eben@@ fold World Cup in 2010 had to sit for six months after taking the intake of pain by Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; she had had strong tooth pain after an operation , defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Disk@@ us / Croatia ) : 2011 the Olympi@@ asi@@ bility of 2012 was tested positive in 2013 and European Championships from 2010 to 2016 on the bot@@ anic stimulation of meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine tested .
Per@@ kovic entered the wi@@ dening intake and was imprisoned six months .
the four most common lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great Gold@@ fav@@ ors .
&quot; La@@ sha@@ wn Mer@@ ano ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positive in 2010 and had been imprisoned 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement would have been responsible , bed@@ ted Mer@@ horseback . &quot;
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 to 400 m of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ty@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly one athletes detected so many medals . &quot;
&quot; so , Ty@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having established testosterone @-@ dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; this also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille of the Olympic Games in 2008 , he received back on account of a ruling part of the International Criminal Tribunal . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m it is ranked second in the world championship .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the World Bank and Gold@@ fav@@ ored tin was tested only in May but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; during the 29 @-@ year old World Championships , references to taking a ban on food supplements was found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency W@@ ada fell mil@@ dly and ran already on 13 July . &quot;
bomb fro@@ ze in Thailand - T@@ akes in breach - Multi@@ ere T@@ ote
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand relate to the woman in contact , said the spokes@@ man for the Foreign Ministry , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fre@@ ag@@ early . &quot;
&quot; she had f@@ aded and had been treated in hospital , but I have already left it again . &quot;
she had planned her home trip in early September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also affected Austrian citizens , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stand in close contact with local authorities , so schn@@ ä@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; in about 200 kilometres south of the capital city of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were initially explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a three @-@ quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thailand would have been killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian soldiers , three Germans , three Netherlands , and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning then again two explo@@ sives went high , and according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
&quot; even from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb attack was reported in the morning . &quot;
at the detection close to the famous swimming pool pat@@ ong a taxi driver has been violated according to police statements .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , at the southeast coast of the country , there is another bomb that killed a city council . &quot;
the explo@@ sives was according to the authorities in a cau@@ li@@ flower in front of the prec@@ inct of the coast @-@ police in the air .
&quot; finally , de@@ on@@ ations demanded in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast , as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the southeast coast . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attack is the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army @-@ General Dan@@ ai Cher@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Fri@@ day@@ early prior to journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
it is too early to express themselves for possible moti@@ fs - probably it &apos;s about the works of Muslim rebels .
also Thai media intended to recognize patterns in attacks that are typical of the bomb attack muscle separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; in contrast , the Thai police declared the attacks not in connection with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage which limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is rather clear that the bombs were placed by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , the authorities would have given secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - however , they were not informed about the exact time and the places . &quot;
still it is unclear what group behind the attacks .
&quot; the police placed their officials throughout the country , security around important government buildings as well as airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always minor bomb attacks , but they usually do not oppose tourists . &quot;
&quot; in Hu@@ a H@@ in lies a palace , which was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j . &quot;
&quot; after the exchange of bombing , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Ministry on its homepage , to ensure the instructions of Thai security authorities as a result . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( safety level 3 ) paid for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ eux and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; according to disputes between security forces and Muslim populations , there will be no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
higher security risk ( safety level 2 ) remains for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on one of the constitution of the military jun@@ ta .
this spatial influence is also a great influence to the military in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta head and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to sti@@ ce chaos , while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a phase of bloody distur@@ ban@@ ces , it considers itself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not been able to get a grip on the rising south of the country since years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
&quot; just around one year ago , in Bangkok with an attack on a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people were killed , most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack of the younger history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the vision of the federal state of constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several country offices , the Constitutional Court of the Confederation was made under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; obj@@ ections to efforts against the free democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , Zu@@ w@@ other Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diff@@ used by the extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
that &apos;s why we are watching the movement now .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it applies against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , Germany , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &quot; identity movement &quot; try to get their target group out where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extremis@@ ts attempt to address them with you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ able music . &quot;
the identities of Islam@@ ists are just like right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is not commercial advertising for your own thing .
propaganda is meant to address the people emotion@@ ally .
young people are very suscep@@ tible in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; at last , there had been reports from several federal states reports about contacts of &quot; &quot; identity &quot; &quot; to Af@@ for@@ politicians . &quot;
Ma@@ ate said that he did not find any knowledge .
for the constitutional protection possible contacts of this type are relevant only from a certain point .
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ for@@ - by certain individuals , who are extrem@@ ist , changing their goal , and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; it is , therefore , if such people have a controlled influence on the party . &quot;
this is not evident .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase of legitimate criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees , Ma@@ d@@ ined , he would not speak of new rights in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that there can be right @-@ ster@@ or@@ istic structures .
it gave the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the free group .
&quot; it may well be that further legitimate group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other far @-@ right motives plan . &quot;
but a clear or across Europe @-@ wide control of legal ap@@ hor@@ ism is not visible .
the previous groups were created at the regional level or social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many over@@ strikes went to the account of men who had not yet come into appearance before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
&quot; many of the Tat@@ ver@@ susp@@ ects at attacks on asylum have not been known as criminal , politically motivated or adher@@ ents to the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have committed crimes committed previously with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts , who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have chosen the example CD@@ U , SPD or left , but who have not been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right m@@ oods . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
the Olympi@@ ans or world records will not always determine the headlines across the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave presence of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
in the Aqu@@ atics Center sw@@ am the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV pictures .
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut was selected .
in social networks Hab@@ its then became the viral Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite .
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old with a review of 48 seconds ended its pre @-@ run and won the 5@@ 9th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather its not just sporty figure which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still participate in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ians got a special store from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ mined countries better known .
&quot; as in ae@@ dic@@ s , most athletes run , I just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname made the lap .
some media signed it as the RO@@ BE@@ L of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id leaf &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made him funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he just struck with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters of Fre@@ isti@@ l , played out there . &quot;
compare with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney the run of Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when it had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
fr@@ ene@@ tically was fired m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; if there is nothing wrong with the election to the US President , Donald Tr@@ ump has already a aging video . &quot;
he then drive back to the holiday .
&quot; losing Donald Tr@@ ump the US presidential elections in November , it would be the relatively no matter : &quot; in the end it will be either cl@@ ap , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; said the candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US TV sen@@ ders CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end of the political correctness , be it in order , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;

mail increases in trade with electrical transport
an electro @-@ free vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vessel is obviously large .
the mail is planning to sell their electrical vehicle sco@@ oters to sell .
&quot; shortly , the Group wants to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post office wants to offer its electrical transpor@@ ter from the coming year also on the free engine .
&quot; we want to get in the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been reviews for months , whether they are delivered on their own and sold @-@ sco@@ oter , with which letters and bags will also be sold to other companies . &quot;

&quot; after information of the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel &quot; , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group will soon enter into the mass production of vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the post@@ own production , the company plans the construction of up to 10,000 cars a year and layer . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ ard had announced , the Group wants to enlarge its fleet of electric cars significantly and in the long run a complete change on environment @-@ friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;

G@@ FR@@ P leadership takes off after dis@@ closing business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanged his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ ups were suddenly - but not quite surprising .
the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K concluded that the chair by leader Matthias Hart@@ mann gets all the more uns@@ afe , the longer the promised success of him promised . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ closing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company &apos;s leadership is the worldwide number five of the industry in front of a personalized new start .
G@@ FR@@ P boss wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board is already made with effect on 12 September from the Supervisory Board .
&quot; the management of the Executive Board already took over 1 September the previous board member with Gerhard Haus@@ smann , divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he is to officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; board speakers &quot; , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the back@@ yard , the company called &quot; different views &quot; to the long @-@ term business orientation . &quot;
details would not want to call a company spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; who will in future become the market research company , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ ent circles , it was on Friday , at the shareholders , at least the disappointment about the continued successes of the years ago resulted in restructuring . &quot;
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K top since 2011 .
&quot; but the fruits of the restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business , each shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if this would be the case when BMW was the case , this would also be the quot@@ as . &quot;
the company had no losses in the preceding quarters in the preceding quarters in the second quarter of 2016 .
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales rose by 6.@@ 1 percent under the level of the comparable @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of EUR 7@@ 21.@@ 2 million were to 3.4 per cent . &quot;
&quot; the profit in the second quarter , above all , has been exposed to its difficult economic situation in the face of its difficult economic situation . &quot;
&quot; the Consumer Experience dedicated to its company &apos;s Consumer Experience is required , of 139 million euros to the Group under the line a loss of 14@@ 8.@@ 2 million . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K generated consolidated profit of 19.@@ 7 million in the second quarter of 2015 . &quot;

&quot; at an accident of a travel agency with 43 seniors as passengers as passengers are injured on Thursday , 8 people ( county of Aur@@ me ) have been injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered heavy injury , divided the police with them . &quot;
&quot; the 66 years old driver of the bus company of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to do@@ dge its data according to a opposite loop , which was partly driving on the counter . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch like a speaker in the police Aur@@ me / Witt@@ mund reported .
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the people could not leave the bus self @-@ constantly , &quot; she said . &quot;

six ambul@@ ances and an emergency treatment came to the accident at the local road 2 .
the in@@ last travelers were brought back by a regular bus back to the Cr@@ ac@@ rob@@ ner district Pe@@ ws@@ um .

the investig@@ ators demanded the truck and the possible witnesses to report himself to the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meters wast@@ e@@ water amount from 1 October 2016 for the area of the wast@@ e@@ water system Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / puppy number 3.@@ 44 instead of previously 2,@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3.@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3.@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage fee will further increase again if corresponding improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a sur@@ less calculation , the se@@ wage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euros per cu@@ bic meters . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted in the approval of the budget by the Ministry of Kul@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems under@@ covers . &quot;
&quot; due to the legal basis , the market is oblig@@ ated to operate the plant . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens as well as the commercial and industrial companies from Space , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must take deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
the ag@@ it@@ ators are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as administrative manager Herbert Schmidt revealed the panel , a new circulation of fees necessary for se@@ wage systems in the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; during the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , be over@@ - or sub@@ covers from the previous year period . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Schmidt based on all three waste facilities for relatively small facilities with a very low waste water , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic metres per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution , for example , it would have a serious impact on the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the se@@ wage se@@ wage in all three plants is slightly decl@@ ining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the se@@ cul@@ ation period continued in all three systems not least due to their age of age and repair expenditure in a significant extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ ter , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf had to be replaced the mechanical loading system due to one damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ins , the nearly 20 year old conveyor systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led by reason and in the pond @-@ position Lop@@ p , after nearly 20 years of operation of the first cl@@ ut@@ tei@@ ke has to be built @-@ in to keep the water legal requirements also in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses came the advanced super@@ visor and maintenance costs which are to be taken into account in the new cal@@ ender period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still considerably below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , supple@@ mentary Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs over the se@@ wage systems in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the conditions for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious according to stone houses on the long run , especially as the utility of the Fri@@ esen@@ bach Valley will not be able to expand these plants because it is about deficit facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year as a positive 0.2 % .
the annual average growth of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.@@ 0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1,@@ 0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell at clothes and shoes ( 2.@@ 2 % ) ; Mo@@ bili@@ ar , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month of alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication , as well as education unchanged . &quot;
sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; effect critic@@ ised as Asian caricature
&quot; Sn@@ ap@@ chat says that this filter Ani@@ me is inspired , but some observers say it is uns@@ ensi@@ tive opposite races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , it allows Sn@@ ap@@ chat about 150 million daily uter@@ ine that change reality and play with identities on such a way that is already borders absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ brid@@ led , stub@@ ble tools that produce more than 30 million improved selections per day . &quot;
all mis@@ steps will arrive to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of using the app Black@@ face fo@@ oting or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slaughter , false teeth and pen@@ ed che@@ eks , there was some critics a rac@@ ist cartoon by Asi@@ atic - &quot; yel@@ lowing . &quot; &quot;
they asked whether this repeti@@ tive controversy sur@@ passed on a larger problem that the company with diversity has .
&quot; the news and indi@@ gn@@ ation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Sn@@ ap@@ le@@ chat that the feature would have disabled . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was meant to be a homage to Ani@@ me characters and not as caricature of Asian .
but out@@ si@@ ders that have experienced rac@@ is@@ m@@ atism rec@@ alled the filter at vulnerable cl@@ is@@ che@@ es .
others declined the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student , whose t@@ ach@@ et over the photos were widely used , that the filter &quot; hur@@ ting and mild &quot; was said uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ ing of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filtering effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ lowing , but that the yel@@ lowing has been drawn into the extreme extre@@ mes . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that has crossed this cultural pride .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration of integration , of conference rooms up to Hollywood and the devices , which we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the things race as their older opponents - might be more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters created a picture that is irrelevant for a user , so it &apos;s much harder that such things were un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 year @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u , she decided to work as a product manager and engineer for medium , your Sn@@ ap@@ chat account requested others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a telephone interview she said that she believe that r@@ end@@ ous controversi@@ es also reflect a lack of diversity with the inser@@ tion practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the great part white , only male leadership and ended their attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no different representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they are safe or comfortable to say anything about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat was largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures concerning the diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday there was Sn@@ ap@@ chat starting to discuss the cultural backgrounds of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ person , the company has recently focused one personnel responsible for conducting the groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Zh@@ u said that she will be closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military @-@ guidance of ISIS &quot; intelligence , &quot; Committee of Congress &quot;
military @-@ member of the United States Central Command has modified official information to draw an optim@@ ist image of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual state of affairs had allowed an investigation committee in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the provisional report , created by a task force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute , intelligence services , and the defense budget , reports on large dis@@ content among Central Command intelligence services , reported how pre@@ vo@@ iced their estim@@ ations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; Central Command , shortly C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ service information , which were typically con@@ stric@@ ted by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ sions , were reported regularly a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism and the actual conditions in place were allowed and were consistently positive as the analyses of other news services , &quot; cited a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the faults in the Cent@@ Com range up to the top tip of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows more detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct reference to that government tips given by Obama instructions , it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command Press statements , statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s will begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Congress of K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of Central Command changed the following reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can sm@@ elling the Task Force in Life , after being assigned to them , that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are underway due to the general manager of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of educational services to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; gave the highest level of democr@@ at in Kom@@ mit@@ me , Member in the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. ship , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; hesit@@ ated the publication of official reports , &quot; ashamed the morality under analysts and , &quot; &quot; gave little room for devi@@ ating opinions . &quot;
&quot; but Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats gave to , no references to an intervention in the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts at a &quot; &quot; specific political opinion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investigations by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were added to complaints of Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; L@@ t. C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a press review of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tors were still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also assumed that &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ ging opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important themes of national defence . &quot;
the investig@@ ators have further impact on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; the alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest inv@@ itations of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state remind of constraints of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the then government headed by George W. Bush looked forward to the recommendations of many analysts just a small occupation of occupation in Iraq and had little time to ins@@ isted on the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to mention governmental authorities , that contrary to the statements of the Government air@@ strikes had not had any significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries had put into operation since this Pro@@ visional refin@@ ing had taken into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times in September reported . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ ar commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critici@@ zed by members of the legis@@ lature because of its over@@ ly positive assessment of the war situation in a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin went retirement in April and was replaced by Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the USA win fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match against India that Americans have won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , that knows them : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , which remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer out of the way that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game may go on Saturday , American people have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed over the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sleeping in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the first @-@ player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , since they could not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
then the year 2012 came into that for her and her team everything went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things to better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
&quot; we did not have the work@@ around in London , which we now have . &quot;
we have the rest of it all around .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a return cover from the local area .
&quot; India was gone without victory in the tournament , but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; it carried a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and invited the ball into the door to get a 2 @-@ 0 leadership . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling in@@ consistent and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid season on competition and aspirations . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if the olymp@@ ic F@@ ack@@ el itself would be a burning stone , which is passed from the bracel@@ et to the swi@@ mmer to tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you cannot switch on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbors in the waiting time in the coffee shop without having Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ap@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there are Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman s@@ warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could have been quite under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and wellbeing TV advertising , if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even fe@@ eder . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the Olympic Fl@@ ame is not illuminated every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air brush , ar@@ chery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the fli@@ pper and may prevail over it for a long time .
&quot; but when I do modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jump already since 2000 a olymp@@ ic event , when it was in Sydney its debut , the last 16 years was so pointed out that many who had questioned , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ way . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the U.S. athletes sent to competition , there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Can@@ adi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; the trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ resolved ear for a Clo@@ wn@@ s@@ schule than the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a built @-@ up enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mor of its never to end clou@@ dy , but also the Grazie of the turn@@ around and diving , the two sports that it essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , meaning as much as &quot; &quot; spring@@ board &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( rotating , yeast , and sal@@ tos ) before they land at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad , they are assessed according to the execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are compete in Rio . &quot;
the common olymp@@ ic vector is straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ill@@ en@@ ario must continue in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes up to the destination , sometimes up and back , up and down at the playground . &quot;
&quot; not only do you chase the Zi@@ ell@@ in@@ ie or the output wall , but in the television transmission also another height : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ords . &quot;
&quot; the pur@@ pose@@ ful pursuit is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I think of myself when looking at these games as something simply .
from this the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a down@@ ward movement is not the target .
&quot; he or she pr@@ elo@@ ad , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , go up , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no h@@ ectic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it can only be Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games only .
&quot; the qualification and ends of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.@@ 00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13.@@ 00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will be radi@@ ate as part of a after@@ math of two days from 14.@@ 00 .
&quot; in the midst of Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the o@@ ids and the objective of the lenses , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey awaits his own , new fans . &quot;
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long , a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstrators are demanding political changes in Ethiopia to prevent violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ ested during the clas@@ hes with the police have been killed by che@@ ers .
is Ethiopia just to be together ?
&quot; over the last ten years it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last months protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and spread themselves in more and more areas .
last week thousands of people rus@@ hed to the streets and slo@@ wed fundamental political changes .
the answer of the government was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave me that poli@@ c@@ emen were shot at seventy un@@ armed demonstrators and killed .
&quot; in the re @-@ run videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety people strike young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand@@ stand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a further investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this land and in the future it will be even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and secret services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new comm@@ uter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations constantly continued oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited , although dissi@@ dents were effective for silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or in prison , or driven into the desert of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you sup@@ press people and these not have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Ms you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in Central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
all the youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous ail@@ ments that cover everything from the ground use up to the lit@@ urgy in relation to power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial line requested in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
analy@@ st fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den in recent years have been more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence over the last few years .
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years of destruction can now explo@@ de under the surface .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as bil@@ berry smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even when the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they are doing at regular intervals , especially at protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies , who are able to hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians have announced that they gathered themselves to their protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Aegean of Ethiopia mainly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economy , while they exploited the Oro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and living in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but even this is changing .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tiger that accounts for about 6 percent of the population , which are dominant in the military , in the secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the distur@@ ban@@ ces is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was up to his death in a not publi@@ ci@@ ed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was particularly interested in using early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to work opponents and make them in@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of the Northern Ethiop@@ ian region , Mr. Hai@@ le@@ mari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services of the tiger @-@ controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia continued to have such a mo@@ ver in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ ested by the government , which was apparently stolen from the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; while the following flo@@ ps were killed many prot@@ esters , even though it were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , as well as the new comm@@ uter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this has not prevented the intention of the internal mis@@ sal of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , a sham@@ anic city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred towards the tiger is becoming more common in the social media . &quot;
analy@@ st say that protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ ant over the neigh@@ b@@ oured Somalia , even though they recently concluded that they closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want his allies collap@@ ses in a already volati@@ le area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ridge . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama was founded &quot; Sar@@ kas@@ mus &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign by attacking its numerous repeated claim , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group , not meant seriously . &quot;
this clari@@ fications cast new questions to the communication skills of the Presidential candidates from the Republi@@ can Re@@ public@@ ans whether he is able to clearly communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings to his collaborators who strive to take him during an event@@ ful phase , into the actual position , to explain statements that he could not meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a election event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump was back in relation to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intend to indicate the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump said , he was just sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the tent@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
when the conservative radi@@ om@@ oder@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to weaken the statement a little by taking it reminded that Mr. Obama wants to destroy him wanted to know anything of it .
&quot; the last storm of criticism bla@@ ze on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of falling values to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton stopped talking to the economic situation in Michigan in this week .
on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject .
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ ic proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he did not find her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to its defense .
&quot; at the end of July he moved strong criticism to him , when he meant , the Russians should crack Mrs. Clin@@ tons enam@@ el , but later he said , &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction falls . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who ob@@ serves the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I believe that he is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ ague enough , so that it can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; rather than def@@ use the sound for the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has taken an even estimated note since its survey values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is that was published on Friday , a tour with a large head start in the states of North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he frequently acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is reinforced in the focus of attention in recent months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal fellow @-@ stri@@ ls to the in@@ convenient situation to stand to him regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may also be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the m@@ umps of prominent performers , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments &quot; said Mr. Giuli@@ ani so he was asked to mention the accuracy of Mr. Tr@@ umps , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is in this sense true that Obama was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them bot@@ h@@ ers , completely false , and therefore it happened because he pulled troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , served in the Mrs. Clinton as Foreign Minister , it ISIS allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media , and cast them down on each of his words and be taken up against him . &quot;
&quot; he desp@@ ises the &quot; poor , j@@ t@@ wilight &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; You cannot do it ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats have spot@@ ted about Mr. Tr@@ umps than a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the Presidential Administration .
&quot; once more about the price of the market , café in Green@@ point comes back . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which no Wi @-@ Fi had , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been displaced . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , the ver@@ b in summer 2014 sold , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
indigenous people saw it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fic@@ ated city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ uses wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it is also a new one . &quot;
&quot; a recur@@ ve Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long@@ time member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he began to work with Ver@@ b 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered a customer to provide money for a new outside , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , held many things . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ pres@@ so model .
it even uses the same lamps out of the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he led new ingredients .
on the menu sand@@ wiches are available with bac@@ on and cheese and there are clo@@ sets like cap@@ tures and sau@@ ted oni@@ ons .
there are natural birds .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez , Rodri@@ guez said that he had noticed a st@@ alled stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by awards from Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Williamsburg earlier in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after having moved to Green@@ point , she would take the way off . &quot;
&quot; after having closed the b , she gave a while the coffee @-@ ham , she said . &quot;
&quot; I realized that there was coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that I liked , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if she ordered this day instead of their usual I@@ ced coffee , a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i tea ordered which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ term and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered inevitably the same .
&quot; I came down to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal gets his usual place , but sometimes he will change his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a d@@ ll that the soap business has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie to produce a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go back to their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ points have also accepted the café as well . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated into the Polish menu and Rodri@@ guez has said that he pre@@ tended to put them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local saf@@ t@@ locally wants to fill the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanding on a sn@@ ap building .
for many customers a new ver@@ b is enough to get their old favour@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was Chief -- and he said that he was destroyed in the ground when the café closed .
&quot; as the new café opened , I said that the Bet@@ ter of Lok@@ als and the bri@@ ghten up a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell the smell , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressed food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a fe@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies on Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland water turtles . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was a little modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , mas@@ hed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with many people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ kers .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was told by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , while Zi@@ egel@@ man tells in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest co @-@ operation , &quot; A decent meal &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich shop for dinner , a small , sle@@ ep@@ tive snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man , 54 , ordered a fresh blan@@ ket with olive oil , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with mas@@ hed potatoes and vegetable mixing . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter ordered co@@ ats , this found the pair for a discussion about the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread and Be@@ ar bro@@ t .
they were prepared from an ingredient and somewhat tri@@ li@@ ously prepared by the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts which they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e gr@@ ins .
&quot; it has to be placed in the stomach such as the lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male rock working , and it was served fresh baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; there were the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square &quot; &quot; draws the paths with which the country turned out to be no longer the s@@ lar@@ en@@ land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for Americans was a central , tense theme , &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; just as excited was the new bud@@ get@@ di@@ so@@ wn : mysterious food like bre@@ ads and cas@@ ser@@ no@@ d@@ ules were com@@ promised to stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ olle as &quot; wonderful kind , eating remn@@ ants &quot; , &quot; given ornam@@ ental ingredients to hide under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dr@@ y@@ wall .
&quot; meat , which was for years the center of American cuisine , became a rare and fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; good bl@@ ends have been tried , as a cal@@ orie @-@ cal@@ orie and wet grati@@ fication of the taste or even healthy kitchen was understood . &quot;
&quot; during their research for the book , which includes also recipes , Zi@@ egel@@ man prepared a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues his way : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home@@ grown recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , bud@@ get@@ ary economics - including Louise Stan@@ ley , Chief Bureau of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 to 1943 - the eating habits of the country @-@ like . &quot;
&quot; publishing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; bud@@ get@@ ary contribut@@ ors &quot; and the challenge to transform Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a celebration of historical ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ cakes @-@ food @-@ post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; while he had publicly praised the simple Iowa farm kitchen , spe@@ c it like the millions of million@@ th man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a fast @-@ golden dining room and took a smo@@ king .
he was very real realistic .
President Roo@@ sev@@ elt might have committed the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have asked him to stat@@ ure a stamp on his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book conducted a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavours through Mrs. Roo@@ sev@@ elt , that the White House brought the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most tro@@ lled food prepared . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of the Great Depression , deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is based on our continued focus on calories and food , Zi@@ egel@@ man said , as well as on how science was applied to food . &quot;
the couple gave them better understood when writing the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in @-@ law - for example they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ egel@@ man reminded , &quot; &quot; She actually made people ill . &quot;
there was the wind @-@ exploited .
&quot; after the plates were distr@@ acted at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e had a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um , the President Roo@@ sev@@ elt , ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that there was a nasty trick , modest recipes had a fancy name to miss . &quot;
&quot; there was no curved cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped somewhat disgu@@ ised a spo@@ on in the fence , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a night@@ fall .
&quot; as a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few sha@@ ved wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ki@@ cked everything to help others to save life .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ year @-@ old even died in a façade bom@@ bed attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil protection group , which had so far to save the lives according to image newspaper about 60@@ ,000 people . &quot;
2@@ 900 volunteers put their own lives in the game to draw people from bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war area .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil war that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the ruins of a house went to the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians for the shining symbolic figure in the Gre@@ ys of war .
&quot; but as heroes he has never seen himself , &quot; says according to picture : &quot; for me that is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think that God sees me a mar@@ ty@@ r . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attack in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have thrown four fac@@ bombs over the Alzheimer &apos;s district , one was filled with chlor@@ gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven men suffer from breathing . &quot;
&quot; we now remove the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play , quotes the image his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest vert@@ ebr@@ tier is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie often come only in the winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie get only after 150 years of offspring .
&quot; leis@@ urely floating the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour he comes at an average just 1.@@ 220 meters wide . &quot;
&quot; only when it happens , the five meters long animal acceler@@ ates to s@@ atte 2.@@ 6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
&quot; however , this long @-@ term co@@ ined lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science &quot; anyway from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means for vert@@ ebr@@ ates a world record . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected long , that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are st@@ ony . &quot;
only lacking the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , eventually they live mainly in the polar sea front of the thin@@ ly populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius they usually appear on the surface only in winter .
&quot; according to the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , researchers know little . &quot;
their time pent@@ pent@@ emp@@ o Ma@@ ze them when they en@@ rolled out six animals with a transm@@ itter .
&quot; loot make this shar@@ ks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had lu@@ cked the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young ice @-@ bears . &quot;
&quot; possibly , they chase sle@@ ep@@ y animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek car@@ c@@ ass , which are tor@@ tured from higher layers of water . &quot;
Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie who took fishermen from 2010 and 2013 to Greenland or Spit@@ s@@ bergen from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 centimeters . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of animals , they analyzed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of reli@@ eving the shar@@ ks of shar@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye @-@ line is already born before the birth of the shar@@ ks , which the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ kers .
&quot; therefore , their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s , as an atomic weapon try larger quantities of this radio@@ active carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in that with 220 centimeters of length , the third @-@ smallest animals contained the lens with a low excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 during his investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their reli@@ eving , on the other hand , normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes , which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock showed for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ tim@@ etres long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k an old age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old during the record @-@ Ha@@ i . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females then get offspring only then , if they are longer than four meters , was well @-@ known . &quot;
the researchers were able to assign the length to an age .
&quot; since one of the animals at 3@@ 92 centimeters probably stood on the cus@@ p of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years has been determined , Greenland with the multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
even this should be the case for vert@@ ebr@@ ates at present world @-@ ord .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 years old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 years old har@@ po@@ on tip , was captured prior to Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , there is often also the organism of the animals living on as@@ parag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and al@@ arms slower .
&quot; to keep in the cold water warm , the animals are often very big . &quot;
&quot; the volume is growing much faster than its surface , by which the animal temper@@ ed heat . &quot;
the heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much bigger than in a grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous , and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ eu@@ er@@ lein . &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest his resources into a long life .
underground in a double pack
&quot; with topics around B@@ auen , the municipal council has focused on the recent meeting . &quot;
&quot; with relief the panel received the Communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently designated residential units can be started . &quot;
&quot; after the property , plot and maintenance request have been clarified and the moti@@ ons could be placed on a measurement , the sale of land properties in the residential areas &quot; road l@@ weg &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section of Bin@@ der@@ straße - elimination of section 1 ) are nothing more in the way to prospective buyers . &quot;
&quot; the com@@ der@@ ate is convinced that the hing@@ es in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and sha@@ ky seniors alike . &quot;
&quot; as it meant , builders can report immediately to the city hall , the allocation of par@@ c@@ els is expected to be advised in his September session . &quot;
&quot; in order to also request further requests for the relocation of further commercial enterprises , connected to creating jobs , the council decided to re @-@ launch the area @-@ used plan in part areas in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the area of sub @-@ term the industrial estates is already being extended there by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main will therefore compete in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg the best opportunities to reloc@@ ated jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt benefits most from the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of Excellence financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether budgets continue to operate from London from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
for the so @-@ called EU passport the approval was given to them in Britain .
this is just using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
the lob@@ by@@ association &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; comp@@ acts with 10000 new jobs on the Main bin@@ s five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , so the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) united the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the euro area , as well as other important authorities such as European insurance review , E@@ IO@@ PA and Risk Management ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the staff is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg there is a great fund business , cutting the same way as Dublin as the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not that easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; in the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties are 50 percent higher than the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offer greater quality of life than competition , thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as fewer crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ran@@ kings of the business consultancy Mer@@ cer , the city took place seven , Luxembourg on square 19 , Dublin to place in place 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; said I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ xit vote , the most important financial center in Europe will remain , mean the economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; for this , the forces of forces : in London they worked at the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead will receive legality from the hepatitis C patent stre@@ ak with Mer@@ ck
a U.S.@@ -@@ Official judge ruled that Gilead Sciences Inc shall be entitled to a refund of the legal costs resulting from the Hep@@ ati@@ te C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .

Mer@@ ck tries to compens@@ ate with Gilead that dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C drugs which can heal over 90 percent of patients suffering from liver disease .

Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.@@ 2 % federal taxes
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton released its tax statement for 2015 , which revealed a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million on Friday and her husband , a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Federal tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 the Clin@@ t USD 1 million donated for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton , the former Foreign Minister gave a income of USD 3 million by the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate for the vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton his control over the past ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ t campaign hel@@ mets were announced at Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ ative contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump is hiding behind false exc@@ uses and feed@@ backs in relation to his previous promises to publish his control . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential data to publish their tax charges , although it is not required by law because of that . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated as the reason for its denial a tax examination by the tax authorities . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaigns in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential campaign . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special consultant , for CN@@ N , that he wouldn &apos;t allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax tests are not completed . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential elections of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already imagined that its ref@@ usal issues in terms of assets , its donations to charitable organisations , its business bro@@ ws and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already thrown on the subject and released a video on the internet , in the high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tr@@ ump on request to publish his tax statement . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke the topic in a speech to the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he refused to do what any other presidential campaign has done in recent decades , and publish its tax references . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; pol@@ tico has reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a series of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ors , the information that this could be still the case . &quot;
federal taxes have become a topic in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and Investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would make sure people earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama supports the proposal also .
&quot; during a election event for Hill@@ ary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ glomer@@ ate took his seat , Tr@@ ump to a meeting in order to exchange their control . &quot;
Buff@@ ets said he was also subjected to a tax examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; fear &quot; before the voters and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ t campaign has been published tax @-@ statement by the year 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ t , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 40@@ ,@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax statement of Clin@@ tons from 2015 showed that these only USD 100 % of their income , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main funds was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ tons dividen@@ ds and proceeds of USD 10@@ 9.@@ 000 killed . &quot;

condoms with Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire @-@ trade unions by encouraging Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ fan@@ ati@@ Protection &quot;
&quot; Natur@@ al@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants , in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them which are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der . &quot;
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation who had previously trained the idea of making volunteers in the North of Tanz@@ ani@@ as to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest without any animals . &quot;
many sc@@ iss@@ ors have used to defend themselves .
&quot; Friday is a puppy day , dedicated to animal protection . &quot;
&quot; since we have developed this ...

Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed to &quot; Arab &quot; - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media release after it had betrayed that the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had not listed , since it would have requested the Arab guests according to an employee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; left his trouble in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lan@@ z@@ mann was trying to find Israel on the lands list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries that can be launched directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; following an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer that he received there , &quot; &quot; saw him &quot; , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
&quot; the hotel has said that the measure was a &quot; inten@@ tional decision of the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , dissolved in the director even more anger . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the member of Lan@@ z@@ mann was cited . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and upset by this event .
this is really very sh@@ ame@@ ful .
the fact that this is carried out in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even a bigger dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions &quot; , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurring a pretty big resonance in the internet , in which people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; some under@@ posed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel , that it would have given the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed of you , it was called in another post in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all accus@@ ations of themselves and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel to enter into the rapid list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung proclaimed a spokes@@ man for the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
it adds that the di@@ alling code has now been added .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; Gum@@ mi@@ de against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students took a meeting on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they gathered together to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ stories against the prot@@ esters .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officer trying to trace the students that led the police rubber @-@ stories and Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of the Federal State in Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , some less than 100 public schools will be closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the Protest@@ ants see Gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls
&quot; the recent protests occurred several days after the demonstrators went to the streets to support the suspended president Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , which was un@@ veiled by a vote of the Senate to their de@@ duction from the ministry . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador of Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade agreement between Moscow and Tehran , increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions on Iran have been lifted up , the interest in Russian businesses grew strongly in shops in the country , divided by Ambassador . &quot;
Russian companies engage existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further commercial construction is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan said . &quot;
he noted that the trade agreement between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million was increased .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports grew by 9@@ 1.5 per cent in Iran and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran grew by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the trade show was achieved by deliveries of machines , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; the ambassador said . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan is coming from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year the Russian foreign representative of around € 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the Top 20 of the countries which concerns the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record figures of Iranian tourists in Russia will be broken from last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses sought : beverage can fall in Wald@@ br@@ öl
an predat@@ ory is exer@@ ted on Thursday morning at the drink of RE@@ WE XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the content of a s@@ add@@ ling armed people demanded three dark dressed persons who were supposed to mix their faces , from the staff of the beverage ar@@ ctic the p@@ inion of cash and then fled then probably with a silver colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police do not share with them . &quot;
&quot; the perpetrators should be between 1.@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters large , thus relatively small . &quot;
the drink @-@ stone is directly accessible from the parking deck of the RE@@ WE market and is un@@ predictable .
&quot; the perpetrators must be sc@@ anned after the assault towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Way and was spot@@ lighted by the car park of the car park with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( h@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who has made observations for the crime time ( against 19.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the rob@@ bery , should get in touch with the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : games and fun at summer time
&quot; eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical group / social group work of the child protection group and their supervis@@ ors in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ l@@ acker . &quot;
in the quiet Frei@@ zei@@ theim Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle was the life @-@ joyful group during the first school holiday season .
several full @-@ day trips were on the program .
&quot; for one , it went to Br@@ ing with the visit of the stro@@ z@@ oos . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the bron@@ n @-@ bron@@ n , where there was a special child &apos;s leadership in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to P@@ for@@ z@@ heim .
in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group drove a lot about the everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days the group at the Tie@@ fen@@ see in the Heil@@ bron@@ n , which was invited to jump , swimming and Plan@@ ting . &quot;

&quot; further highlights of the leisure time were the fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te evening &quot; . &quot; &quot;
on the day of visit@@ ation the sun and the children and young people returned home .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ m to the gate of Mer@@ cy
the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral unit E@@ gg@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
together we were accomplished four stages .
&quot; to bridge the period up to the next novels of all Min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in two years , the Ober@@ min@@ is@@ tran@@ ten@@ dering St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgri@@ ma@@ ins targets have been tested and decided finally to the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ stadt Freiburg , where this year , at the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , was offered a special pilgri@@ m aim at this occasion of the Saint Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and hal@@ ves made their way forward . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , Pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the pilgrimage and divided the pilgri@@ ma@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where there was also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er &apos;s woman , and thus the pilgrimage route was made away from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; during the morning and evening each day at the end of the day and in the evening , depending on a brief impulse with different poems , songs and writers were en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; but also on the road the Min@@ is on Feld@@ kreu@@ zen , chap@@ els , or churches are repeatedly re@@ ast to sing a song from a peculiar pilgri@@ m pilgri@@ m . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the rec@@ tory of the local par@@ ishes stood at the disposal of the local par@@ ishes . &quot;
&quot; at the Et@@ ch@@ enzi@@ ed Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ all for a sav@@ our@@ y , as well as for dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day we went over Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags at the time of St. Peter came to St. Peter , which was the hardest way , but at first some 500 meters had to desc@@ ended and thereafter again . &quot;
the earned reward was in the evening a common gri@@ lling on the beach .
after the dawn of dawn on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter it went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ ter to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met at the later afternoon in the Frei@@ burger Münster , and through steps the gate of mercy met . &quot;
we would like to thank God for a small impulse .
&quot; in the evening fair in the Münster , which were welcomed at the pilgrimage Min@@ is by Ko@@ operator Markus O@@ bert . &quot;
after the worship the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the high@@ altar .
the next day there was time for the Bre@@ is@@ mer metropolis .
after@@ no@@ ons we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; in the end , all participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med down at home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner sha@@ ste last night in the male team Sprint in the Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to glory as the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old born of Glasgow assumed a roll @-@ up role , which had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young and made the legend of pride when he rus@@ hed to home a victory from the favorite New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a shocking victory over four years ago while Ho@@ y fet@@ ched the fifth of six olymp@@ ic gold .
they repeated the trick after they took place in March by train World Championships in London despite the retreat Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as Hin@@ ts .
ho@@ ys retired a gap to close the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton .
Sk@@ inner was the man who remained with whom they saw when they saw potential in the vill@@ i that now develops .
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y - and Sk@@ inner sat in the Quali@@ fication round an Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord , but in the still@@ s victorious the New Zealand in the first lap . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his turn left , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy shift did a big part of the transformation , in which he drove to a higher gear to slow him and to enable Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to hold the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y saw from his position as the BBC expert , and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me .
in the end we had set up a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord and the world champion was defeated .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 at the page Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys , there was Hin@@ des that he turned back to the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he later returned this statement and there was no claim of England Rival .
&quot; with such a superior victory , there was no such problem for this time . &quot;
&quot; said : &quot; &quot; it feels with the whole GB flags on the Tri@@ b@@ une as London . &quot;
we have come together as a team for the past three months .
&quot; we have come so badly with so many world titles , that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were obtained seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days in Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
with the form Kenn@@ ys it is in the realm of the possible that he is repeated winning of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in one competition .
&quot; that would mean for Kenn@@ y - who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y who was also born on March 23 ( a apparently holy date for British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - a explo@@ iting of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that came out of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y starts next in the Sprint who starts today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; saying , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only med@@ all@@ ists competition of the day but there were other good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the Vi@@ erer @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 at the destination . &quot;
&quot; the world record , won in 2012 in London for 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins and Security . &quot;
he held yesterday with Be@@ z@@ oned before the qualification round as it smells of him to measure its body size .
&quot; in the context of the Women &apos;s Competition , the tomorrow continued and ended , av@@ anced Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bar@@ ker and K@@ atie Archives soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in world war period in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team leaves its strong railway team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick up a scar@@ ring of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional appearance of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been run@@ down . &quot;
&quot; drama also played drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ ing@@ es , as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself the first evening of competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom competition , it looks like the legendary call GB@@ s that has reached its peak again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land based on the lifting of the energy consumption
&quot; the future of the aluminum mel@@ tdown of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - stand at stake , since the system operators will cancel the energy supply contract and therefore receive all delivery contracts , as the supplying energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the government &apos;s decision in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for the operation of the plant . &quot;
a Sub@@ si@@ diary set up for 20 years and runs in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs - direct and indirect - could be endangered at an closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects because the melting around 10 percent of the total electricity sector of the Vict@@ ori@@ as is consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melting pot , which resulted in a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station last year . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risk a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation for the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last but not least because of the current price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which the large aluminum mel@@ tdown supplied with its Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley supplied with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese company CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p will hold smaller proportions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L is assumed that the plant in Port@@ land continues to operate , which means further physical demand for electricity by melting pot , &quot; shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts are so @-@ called &quot; &quot; backup operations &quot; &quot; which should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 @-@ month period of notice so that they will end 2017 .
&quot; as a result , AG@@ L proceeds from that contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supply . &quot;
all potential impacts on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of strong appointments for wholesale prices .
AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of the contracts in its annual amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in the anticip@@ ation of a cancellation .
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... &quot; the melting together , or the power supply to the melting &quot; is not com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that 2010 had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who had to come into force in 2010 , even if there is still a statement of why it has been res@@ igned by the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melting in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility in the vicinity of Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land annually consume around 600 mega@@ watts and tomato around 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; if both installations disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating set , this would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; with a size , which resembles more a picture @-@ band than a fashion magazine , the output attracts a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista ) , with the 8@@ 32 pages of rolling stock 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of his co@@ ver@@ stars will be so longing , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine are still un@@ le@@ ased before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebrities , &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; &quot; as &quot; Mod@@ els , &quot; the celebrities . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Econom@@ ist and Di@@ or brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs J@@ enner - the one described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; pattern model &quot; &quot; of its generation is described - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
these celebrities are not related to famous people or if stars or teenagers from today who know how to set a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if everything is on the denomin@@ ator ) .
they are really talented women who exc@@ el in the entertainment industry .
Be@@ y@@ once that appeared on the last cover with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of their career .
&quot; of course , Jen@@ ners do not like it to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its Reality @-@ TV story , Jen@@ ners was always tense in the fashion world . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ Modell Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the M@@ ist@@ les of the moment .
these feelings co@@ war@@ med up again when the message with the Er@@ appear Jen@@ ners came out on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but riding on the mis@@ ness riding seems to go by the point .
K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner is on the cover of the Sept@@ em@@ ber@@ issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
she runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
they and all their sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
you sold the pictures from Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she has to be seen in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; in addition , there are 16@@ 0.000 people every year from &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the most vulnerable of the country will be rejected annually by the municipal centers , while the industry has already taken on the effects of other medium @-@ sized transactions already over@@ thrown transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ eting and similar assistance - in their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are prepared for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of its funding . &quot;
&quot; the director of the municipal three centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell said that the final survey of the National Association of municipal office centres yiel@@ ded that thousands of people will be rejected every year . &quot;
&quot; Far@@ rell said that the situation would only be worse , without the suspension of the accus@@ ation of the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; Queens@@ bor@@ der@@ e@@ urs centers are chron@@ ically funded , which means thousands of people of important services you need to be rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave non @-@ violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and depres@@ sing debts , families who were dischar@@ ged by divi@@ des , workers who have un@@ just dis@@ missed the problems of a legal nature and this survey shows that they may not get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General nationwide and Federal Minister of Justice and Federal Minister of Justice and Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis , so that people can get help they need to receive legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government established its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to see the needs of the local communities and its clients &quot; communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work . &quot;

&quot; the incident was described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday at the National Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ordin@@ i existed to have been waiting for months , that the matter would be regulated internally before it re@@ alising that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , there are significant losses for the government bonds and CD@@ U . &quot;
this was representative of the opinion of the opinion research institutes IN@@ SA for the &apos; Image &apos; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black governmental organizations in the north could barely be ruling , this is not possible after the demand values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both federal states , the SPD would be the strongest party and therefore would have a good chance to continue to head the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD rose from 3@@ 5.2 per cent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party is still close to the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent again . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left came to 19 percent ( formerly 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; despite light losses , the Greens do not hesit@@ ant with 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the heav@@ y@@ day of the country . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP would not be represented by 3 percent in the country day .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD member states would say only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
they still sm@@ iled behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) .
&quot; at 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Represent@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP might hope for a return that the pirates would be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Time : 20 years ago the Nokia Communic@@ ator came to the market .
the followers today dominate the world - his producer experienced a disaster .
the unit weigh@@ ed almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite obvious . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was at first eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fers with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now shipped with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ yte .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator &quot; came exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , lovers of the equipment can still buy on the internet , but they are somehow from the St@@ one@@ age of the internet era . &quot;
&quot; however , 20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West Bank format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent for then standards a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by HTML @-@ browser , though agon@@ izing slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; very proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , thus about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was in 2015 at 3@@ 92 Euro .
nobody could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator of the beginning of the smartphone era would be .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the mobile as@@ parag@@ us of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft and handled . &quot;
&quot; today , they dominate the market today , which came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; and all over and everywhere , this is a very many people everyday life . &quot;
2015 there were almost two billion smartphone users around the world .
&quot; some 1,@@ 1.4 billion devices have been sold on Samsung and Apple alone with 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
worldwide sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros .
these are the well @-@ running shops of the countless app provider and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , around the smartphone has become a whole industry . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only in the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple head Steve Jobs announced on Mac @-@ World the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communications , all easy to use by touch @-@ screen . &quot;
&quot; the victory of Apple began , even today the iPhone is the most important product of the group . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry who ruled the market had the look . &quot;
&quot; finally , they disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now you have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
in the cut every German meanwhile sees 88 times a day on his cell phone .
&quot; we must all learn to get away the smartphone even better , &quot; said Jan@@ ina ball , in the Siemens executive board of staff . &quot;
permanent availability is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring prosperity and prosperity to our local municipalities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me that was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London , when we were able to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve again by creating new possibilities for or@@ ts@@ resident and firms in the vicinity of He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already producing 10,000 new teachers , 40,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , it will be such that the challenge of enlargement He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws are too big . &quot;
I was told that England was never ready for the games and that we will bl@@ ister on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ gly wron@@ gly and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
there are always obstacles to overcoming but He@@ a@@ throw answers each of him .
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual an infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ch@@ oral growth and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and throughout the UK . &quot;
&quot; we got a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion &apos;s infrastructure program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport enter@@ tainers , until T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two frequented tre@@ ach@@ ers of the world . &quot;
&quot; now , they are ready to deliver a third run @-@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will be one .
&quot; it is time for we ste@@ er this Olympic spirit and bro@@ aden He@@ a@@ throw and create our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment , which can be proud of England . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz &quot; &quot; and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding display blocks &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to deal with display blocks , a &quot; K@@ atz@@ - and mouse Game . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there would display scor@@ ches on its desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ gger where users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared Facebook with that its dis@@ top@@ ic@@ site would change the enco@@ ding in terms of its promotional view , in order to detect an indication of the detection on which part of the page is advertising to make it difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er struggle between the an@@ op@@ ed open source community and the envel@@ ops already exists since the invention of scor@@ ching loos@@ ening systems , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest company for social media has left into battle is a strong Indi@@ z which has become worrying indication of the industry .
&quot; according to a study from the last year of Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe approximately 200 million people , advertisers ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , who access Facebook over their mobile devices , makes manual value 84 percent of advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has indicated it on display block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block has no effect on fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs is a sufficient share of revenue from so Facebook appears to be the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday Facebook shared Facebook with that there would be his &quot; &quot; scor@@ eboard &quot; &quot; to have more control over their advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook claimed that Ad@@ ditional new filters were worrying , because they would also block content on the page , which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this does not represent positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a speaker from Facebook in an e @-@ mail message . &quot;
&quot; indication block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we concentrated on developing tools such as ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected suicide on the Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police calls witnesses to witness after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday at a suspected self @-@ suicide of several vehicles on a highway over@@ ride .
&quot; the incident occurred on the A1 , near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud , shortly after midnight . &quot;
&quot; a woman placed himself in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the streets and were hit by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud , &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a sweat at the age of 49 is that of several vehicles , including a burden , over@@ ride , himself wanted to kill . &quot;
it died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers were already heard , but some have still not been identified , said the police , who calls this and every witness of the incident to sign up . &quot;
&quot; it became an investigation procedure opened what a &quot; log@@ istical &quot; step in such a situation is , divided Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
however it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown .
was a clash prev@@ ent@@ able ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the past five years show that the driver will not be held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases , a person in the dark on the motorway ran - was decided that the drivers don &apos;t have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a poli@@ cem@@ an was acqu@@ itted of the experienced kill@@ ings after having passed a man and killed August 2014 one night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the Court asser@@ ted that the poli@@ cem@@ an -- which had responded to an emergency call -- on an justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely extraordinary and unfor@@ es@@ een situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has further information regarding the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges , should report to the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate models : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
the Venus was probably once inhab@@ itable according to proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies der NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus in the basis of tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have applied with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that the slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and still slowly shifted . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accomo@@ date life and protect them from faster ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus benefited also from a sun that was 30 percent of the matter .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simul@@ ates expon@@ entially the slow revers@@ al of Venus their daily side of the Sun almost two months long , &quot; stated G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer clouds , which affects the surface of a large portion of the solar heat . &quot;
the result are average temperatures that are cooler than that of the Earth today .
&quot; the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution , which was previously assumed by planetary research . &quot;
&quot; although it was once inhab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years - was subjected to much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans ev@@ ap@@ ed and their water vap@@ or was burned from the ultra @-@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , there remained only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know it today . &quot;
the researchers also shared the results of their new Venus climate models in the Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer from Tos@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Region of Avalon and led to a small decision @-@ making process for the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new trainer . &quot;
&quot; over the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado of Avalon , with energy , passion and determination , &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy has expressed in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought much about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , this requires it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly adapted to the organisation . &quot;
&quot; he must also have a decision @-@ right at decisions , which influence the performance of the team . &quot;
at the moment these conditions are not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had been entrusted to Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Trainer of the League during its debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the Best Trainer of the League .
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and first place in the Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the description marked in the season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 brand and fell behind the Wild for a second game @-@ card spot in the Western Conference to five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the suit of Avalon . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ e@@ öl@@ z@@ zer again take talks on , strike Stri@@ ke &quot;
&quot; the work struggles regarding the remuner@@ ation for North @-@ oil workers are exposed , while all the armed forces put on the table for a new discussion of the table , they said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service providers Wood Group were conducted spor@@ adic@@ ally on platforms in the North Sea , which are operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group , as well as the in@@ ite and r@@ ammed trade unions , can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ establish the resolution of the current struggle , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will keep some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start early next year in order to re @-@ address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage rates of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; Wood Group has shortened this year to its contrasts in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation of the company follows a 10 @-@ percentage drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released for its part of thousands of people and announced plans to abandon its oil and gas business activities , as a result of his meg@@ at@@ collaboration with the British Energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation based on lower crude oil prices , which had to leave the European Union by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of this week , Dave Anderson met working leaders at the beginning of this week , to discuss one of the largest work@@ ings since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.@@ 1.4 billion on expenditure for new projects in the North Sea , compared with an average of about $ 7 billion expected over the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures Rot@@ ation rate of stars in the star @-@ run of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler space tel@@ escope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the complete catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the star @-@ star of the ple@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; the new data will help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars in the star enh@@ aufen to different forms and in what regard the rotation periods are available with the planetary process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by the understanding of our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the history of his solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light@@ years from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated about 125 million years ago , are now achieving adul@@ thood . &quot;
you are now turning at the fastest .
&quot; at the peak of peak , these mi@@ tig@@ ate stars come from large quantities of ast@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; because these win@@ ch travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a brake effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is alternat@@ ely , its rotation begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a discer@@ ni@@ ble star -- as sun@@ spots -- .
&quot; the latest catalogue of rotation rates points out , that a massive star more slowly turning more than less massive stars . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; b@@ allet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rotation tend to be massive , whereas faster star@@ es tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ bapti@@ sm@@ s of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal kos@@ her laboratory to compare the stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; it is still a lot in front of us what we would like to know more about how the How , W@@ ann and Why stars burned their rotation rates , and so to speak their &quot; &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported a detailed report about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; three times , Rodri@@ guez was elected to the most valuable player of the League , 2009 he won the Yan@@ ke@@ es the World Series . &quot;
his signature under one tenth of the year has been giving it 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; by the end of the contrac@@ tion on 31 December 2017 , he will be working as a consultant and youth coach - with full content . &quot;
as players paid a lot of Rodri@@ guez a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2000 ) , and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es managed to win some milestones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of Fame @-@ Fame @-@ Members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players are wise in the most important statistics similar values . &quot;
&quot; however , to the rest of the bas@@ eb@@ alls of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls the 41 @-@ year @-@ old cannot be recorded . &quot;
&quot; for so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was , so controversial his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 the Super@@ star gave to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 to have taken advantage of ster@@ oid stero@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked in the so @-@ called biogas @-@ sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered to be a prime fro@@ st for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Southern Florida @-@ Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the League could even have done a favor for 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ guez said then . &quot;
even his farewell days did not go no@@ un@@ ted .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their final games once again received the big stage , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bank . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves the attempt to win every game &quot; &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az , and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson promised , sympathy @-@ conversion of the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Arch@@ onal Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; s@@ lic@@ ed the trailer in the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
knowing : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample may not start wei@@ ght@@ the@@ er Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski from Poland in Rio in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games 2016 will be over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing accidents .
a wis@@ ely Ath@@ os could have won almost one coin .
&quot; before the seventh race day , the first official Dop@@ dop@@ ing Games have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ er in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter barriers in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish weights for Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were tested and excluded in Brazil - just before the beginning of the already critical athle@@ tics cont@@ ests , these messages are coming to the accident . &quot;
&quot; during Ch@@ en has been demonstrated by the Di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de last Sunday , which is used as a masculine means for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Court CAS confirmed the exclusion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took the fourth place in the final on 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds , she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the courses over 50 m Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national Association take the matter &quot; &quot; very serious and demands full cooperation with the investigations &quot; &quot; zi@@ pped X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ Court CAS and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the re@@ frac@@ turing of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
also in the night of Rio oo@@ ed the news about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa by which 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; &quot; stated the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is intended to act on the f@@ aked substance to deal with the EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should also be positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov formed immediately with criticism of the Ath@@ ena &apos;s word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes do not pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , about all the wei@@ ght@@ fulness of the chron@@ ically @-@ dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Go@@ in@@ ski &quot; &quot; was announced , the London Olympi@@ eger in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z three days previously positive on the an@@ ole ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; in front of the start of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further difficult blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF had banned the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ings , even the runner @-@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the former associations in China had also taken care of fierce disputes between athletes . &quot;
thus the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ eger Sun Yang in Mali .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to commit myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun rose also at the center of a confrontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was positive in 2014 with the Chinese champi@@ onships tested positive on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ acker her ran@@ som
programmers of Er@@ press@@ ungs @-@ mal@@ ware currently rely on companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months were at least once , partly several victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the goal of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators specialised their black@@ out software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to be pressed is significantly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetrators of Er@@ pres@@ sors were discovered .
&quot; first , private use were the goal , but the change to company attacks was terri@@ fying quickly during the past months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works after a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim &apos;s active , it searches for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as after archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the Ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail .
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need money - usually in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake , the company is about sensitive customer data or project databases , without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls if a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies involved in sales losses by ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break the business completely , in a case people were in life of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals in Germany were victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by the loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say to the victims always : pays not , you only promotes the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; but 80 to 90 percent of companies , which pay , get their data once more . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetrators in the light of a stand@@ still . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good reputation .
in a current study the security researchers of F @-@ Secure the utility areas and contact with black@@ mail@@ ers investigated and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a sort of customer service in order to take more money .
&quot; they explain their sacrifice to chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , are free @-@ accessible support sites or de@@ code free example files . &quot;
&quot; and will redeem private people after payments of a few hundred euro , companies need to pay partly hard and five @-@ digit sums , in order to redeem their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ acker becomes more professional and share the work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from Anti@@ virus @-@ provider Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around one week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ out .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the mal@@ ware themselves , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included in the package is a adap@@ tive tool , so that smaller configurations , look and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ser then look for further h@@ ackers in order to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so you log in one of the forums on the underground , buy the set of a criminal and put another way to install the software on as many PCs . &quot;
the payment is made per in@@ calcul@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually over@@ put the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that ensure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey will rely on Ran@@ som@@ ware to rep@@ el the Ran@@ som@@ ware using file @-@ back @-@ ups and scans software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful detection , the perpetrators instead , with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; with this , damages are still higher than before , according to the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetrators would also be able to make completely new goals on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ conference Def@@ con demonstrated the security researcher , as they could get an with the Internet for ther@@ es Thermo@@ stat under their control . &quot;
in the middle of winter the activation of such a troubled heating could be well worth a ran@@ som .
&quot; if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production way in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a subject in the Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and versatile .
&quot; in the little HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty un@@ loading , but the HR @-@ V that was constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1,@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior space are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top is there something . &quot;
versatile than comparable vehicles is the HR @-@ V reservoir .
&quot; not only a trunk @-@ room of 4@@ 53 l is available at high @-@ level and 10@@ 26 l with re@@ cl@@ oned back , but there is the &quot; magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the seats of the spine can be sp@@ elled as Kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus offer storage space , which is high up to ceiling 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well ventil@@ ated , but the load height is 650 mm slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ diesel with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in large turn@@ key areas very powerful .
&quot; however , he should do something qui@@ eter for his work . &quot;
&quot; pleasing is the consumption of 4,@@ 7 l / 100 km . &quot;
there is another motorcycle : a 1.5 @-@ l gasoline @-@ gasoline with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an extra @-@ drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behaviour is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering is likely to be a little more direct .
the equipment can be desired in the tested Top @-@ variant &quot; Executive &quot; No wishes .
&quot; to the security systems , the City @-@ not@@ bra@@ king @-@ resistant ( works up to speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions system and the sp@@ ind@@ le assistant . &quot;
the coll@@ isions are ir@@ ri@@ fied sometimes because it assessed many obstacles as &quot; her@@ ann@@ ul@@ ating objects . &quot;
very reliable works the remote super@@ visor .
and the smart temp@@ o drives responding to the road detection and d@@ ros@@ ine when required the speed .
&quot; the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and therefore are somewhat awk@@ ward to reach .
the approximately 29@@ 000 euros for the well equipped top diesel diesel are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much will receive the gasoline from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 exhau@@ st standard .
with the HR @-@ V Honda offers a versatile and all@@ tag@@ onal car .
Air@@ line is not liable : down@@ fall to Air@@ bridge
an Air@@ line is not liable for the overthrow of a passenger on the air@@ bridge .
&quot; for a liability be conceivable only with dangers that are typical of air transport , argued the Ober@@ nationwide Court Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down in the fall of a knee injury .
&quot; however , the accident could have been happening everywhere - it is a general age of life , so the court . &quot;
the airline had no damage to the man .
disease case : when paid the Organ@@ izer
ill vac@@ ation@@ ers after their trip will only get money back when the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel .
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in this case , a family had been suffering from the second day of their Turkish ro@@ ur@@ lau@@ bs to diar@@ rhea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a faul@@ ty se@@ wage plant that pur@@ ged the sea@@ water poll@@ uted .
&quot; the family was in view , the trip was faul@@ ty with it - and mour@@ ned against the organis@@ ers . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success .
although the se@@ wage plant was indeed broken .
but the organizer continued just before the departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs .
he had to go beyond that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he has therefore not violated his information obligations , so judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of water no contam@@ in@@ ants were found .
the condition of several hotel guests - possibly by infection with each other - belonging to the general age of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests there were only 38 ap@@ ots .
&quot; the Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , according to the crimes of refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people had concern for further attacks . &quot;
the state had to be ref@@ us@@ hed and decided to act on the terrorist attack .
sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hatred and division .
we will not treat the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders would have to leave the country faster , but the safety and strength of the people will also be the approval of the people for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to achieve a implementation of the proposals until the Federal election of 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ alization of security forces , and in medium @-@ sized scale , over several years . &quot;
sympath@@ ies for terrorism must be under punishment again .
video surveillance is to be improved that weapons will be opened on the internet especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is worth .
the last much deb@@ ated sweat for doctors should remain intact after the Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in dialogue with the health care system , as the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psychological abnorm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed man .
&quot; in addition to the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to be used to be used . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increase security further . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of Interior spoke clearly against action .
&quot; that was a ear for the hing@@ es on the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban , and the abolition of double citizenship previously rejected . &quot;
it is a general ban on the enforcement of authority he is constitu@@ tionally problematic .
&quot; you can not for@@ bid everything you reject , and I rest the wearing of bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; speaking , one can talk about rules approximately in traffic or for witnesses in court . &quot;
green leader in Simone Peter threw the minister before he wants to simul@@ ate with ever new anti @-@ terror packages .
&quot; left @-@ wing party manager Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Spray and a ti@@ ghtening of the common right will no longer bring people to this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it is regularly on the circum@@ vent - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the rule of law should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all the Car drivers , who stand in traffic on the ambient road every night in the traffic jam , if you drive via the highway A@@ fr@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
the road building is extended on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 . August ) in the area between the hammer street and the descent Wes@@ eler street the right track to 700 meters .
&quot; drivers , then direct from the hammer street to the right . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage : traffic is early on , reducing the total amount of course on the multi @-@ prop@@ elled section of the Federal Road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the District Court of Münster @-@ West .
driving pass@@ a@@ ways on the road @-@ jum@@ pers get the motor@@ ist especially between 17 and 7 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return of back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
&quot; because of this , the con@@ i@@ ght on the B is 51 shortly before the departure of Wes@@ eler street . &quot;
from here the traffic is given only a gau@@ ge via the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in front of a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations were yiel@@ ded that the bridge no longer has the required load @-@ power , in order to be above all the heavy duty to double . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the associated union daily ste@@ au , the responsible national company can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is expected to reck@@ on with years : for the bridge has an official rest period up to 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal force , the country has deliberately picked up the traffic @-@ weak@@ est time in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will run by the site on Tuesday and Wednesday at the site .
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theatre &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s Association allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; class International &quot; of the forest school children &apos;s home has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; &quot; 19 students visited the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association offers the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background to the aim of visiting schools with welcome classes , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most of the youth of the class were from September 2015 to March 2016 , among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ an images and video animations made it possible to follow it , however , follow the release of the Young Theatre Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from Language , and the Young Theatre will work together in the context of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to contem@@ plate courses in the fields of vocals , dance , dance and music . &quot;
special offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal productions are planned in the planning .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the increasing number of refugees , the association is counting on many classes that want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of star@@ ving : hope for weather improvement
the weather has made the star @-@ sn@@ ags in the southwest of Germany during the night to Friday a stand by the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suitable because of clouds and rain , the sky spec@@ ulative , said the chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we certainly see many star tracks in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with the star @-@ scales , it is per@@ for@@ ks that belong with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour to the fastest constellation . &quot;
they have their name because they appear to come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us in the north @-@ east .
relaxing Night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; at night you have been around forever , at night you are awake for hours , in the morning we no longer think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleeping and over ten per cent experience their sleep often or permanently . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep distur@@ ban@@ ces , and there are many causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ aving , board member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Schlaf@@ es . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , but the in@@ som@@ nia is never , so an input and sle@@ ep@@ disorder . &quot;
&quot; just that all sleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ fying or inadequate , Jens Wagen@@ knecht , board member in the German Haus@@ er association with practice in the German @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind it can organic , mental or dis@@ continued factors , but also drugs are stuck . &quot;
not rare is the disorder expression of another condition .
&quot; very early aw@@ aken is common especially for depression , &quot; says We@@ ap@@ le . &quot;
and it can be that different factors would like each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a sli@@ pped disk , can be bad , wake all two to three hours and start p@@ onder@@ ing , about everyday problems and worry , gives We@@ ap@@ ly an example . &quot;
&quot; that leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who will not sleep well over a month from one month to at least three nights per week and is com@@ promised on the day , should go to the doctor , betra@@ ys We@@ ap@@ le . &quot;
&quot; impairment can be quite different : it is down@@ cast , tired , un@@ exhausted , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical discomfort such as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to rel@@ ieve the sleeping disorder , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options , among other things behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or also medicines - classical in@@ tim@@ ings occur only in exceptional and at the most for two weeks - question . &quot;
&quot; low dormit@@ ories are rare in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of interdisciplinary Medical Center of Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; that is why one should say in sleep problems at first , in front of the household doctor , betra@@ ys We@@ ap@@ le . &quot;
this can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a bodily cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep laboratory , and what happens there ? &quot;
&quot; to examine in the sleep laboratory emergen@@ cies , for example with snoring with respir@@ ator , with path@@ ological day fatigue , with sle@@ ep@@ ting or if one does not find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder , says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation . &quot;
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after the c@@ abling one goes to the bed of his normal time .
&quot; besides the electro@@ des in the body , one carries a nose @-@ glasses , a chest strap and a anten@@ na@@ e at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can people cope with the problems ?
there are quite a lot of spots where you can get a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ as@@ ons count on : regular bed@@ time and res@@ isti@@ ble periods , not too long in bed , don &apos;t sleep well , don &apos;t watch television for sleeping , alcohol , and at night do not look at the clock - then one starts immediately to reck@@ on , and that is all and certainly not con@@ du@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;

&quot; in a country where an olymp@@ ic winner receives $ 20,000 € premium , and a jungle . 15@@ 0.000 € no one should be surprised about the lack of medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old one night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing controls on the other hand very well . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries which promote a great deal and do not look so closely on the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;

airport : ban@@ de of baggage just arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the Airport Düsseldorf
civil servants of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer &apos;s police took the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 years .
the Tat@@ ver@@ susp@@ ects had committed several pick@@ up and luggage co@@ ver@@ ings .
&quot; against 21.@@ 30 clock &apos;s civilian officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de , which was known by the poli@@ c@@ emen from the past theft of theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since mid @-@ July of this year , and have been very professionally managed and particularly professional . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the crimin@@ ality Com@@ miss@@ ari@@ ats 34 can have travelled the di@@ so@@ oth@@ es for crimes of criminal off@@ ences to Germany , four actions . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had earned a total of more than 15.000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a few lenses , in the meantime , a few lenses : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in works at first sight not so , but the police counts them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; if one goes along the road from the east to the west , one comes to play spaces , a fresh@@ est kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; sc@@ anned .
&quot; opposite a Li@@ d@@ l which is to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new flats . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as mentioned the responsible estate company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in , in recent weeks , however , preferred by burning cars in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents of rental contracts , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the year Hen@@ kel , Hen@@ kel had spoken several times for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after June 22nd the rooms were vac@@ ated on the ground floor , the Kad@@ mi@@ ths , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rolling the police three weeks long official statements , with 30 to 40 officials and three teams of teams , bul@@ war@@ ped parts of the street and held visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers on behalf of the un@@ known household owners the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administrative Court ruled that the clearance was illegal , and a day later , police and builders under the itch of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer morning the street works peace@@ fully : parents go with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others entertained vor@@ m Sp@@ ät@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; lef@@ tist authority is not the main attraction of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs here three children , especially from the police presence . &quot;
with the inhabitants of household projects they share the concern for increasing r@@ ents and gases .
it does not sound like a p@@ aving who wants to em@@ itting multiple poli@@ tic@@ ular protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ on left .
&quot; the dit@@ ch , the one of the Berlin interior and the police between house@@ wives and their neighbours , does not seem to exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working class , which also has a low average age in comparison to the rest of the city and has high poverty risk . &quot;
&quot; even home@@ work and the living @-@ living projects belong long to the Kiev : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including almost the entire Mainz street near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was ev@@ acu@@ ated under great police force in a down@@ right street , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited by the people they had occupied 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the quarter of the past few years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and electoral liner from around the world : with them now inhabitants of the GDR @-@ Time and former house occupied its Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; this also makes itself noticeable in the r@@ ents , which has increased by nearly 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the re@@ constructions in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one re@@ alizes them in wor@@ ded sli@@ ces , or freshly made fac@@ ades , that were cast with colour explo@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one reason why not all neighbours can view this as a problem , could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body breaking are projected almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make insur@@ ances , the ten@@ tious rather the newly built and newly renovated houses meet . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lived for 17 years in a rental house next to the controversial 94 , can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which are certainly not intended . &quot;
even the famous burning cars will no longer give it in the Rig@@ a@@ er for longer .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become conscious of the Riga street - and stayed .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the inhabitants get back their way : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claims the interpretation of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of the inhabitants of Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street continues to be taken away : through secure new builds in former buildings that are pushing the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many here - here are more people who are not as good as they are , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I be absolutely non @-@ profit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what should we do , if someone never h@@ ears someone ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for officers , who fre@@ es himself about colour bombs , Ker@@ stin has had little understanding : the house @-@ projects and the left scene belonged to the Kiev . &quot;
&quot; who moves , should be aware of it - just like anyone who moves into a pub that can complain about noise from there . &quot;
&quot; all persons named after the first names have asked for , not to be called with their correct name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
&quot; furthermore , it is a social worker . &quot;
since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ster was the refugee camp for Ur@@ bach .
the social pedago@@ gin supports the management team around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berg .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact person for all actors : refugees , the work of refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else still mit@@ er . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that deu@@ sch@@ le now is , the jeal@@ ous W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in such a way , some - less spot@@ ting than on the multitude of wish @-@ areas aim - meant that the administration wanted to write the site . &quot;
&quot; searched for a administrative power with a talent for languages and people , associated with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an experienced W@@ oll@@ mil@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; administrative work is not its central area , &quot; &quot; Anni@@ ka deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been here for around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place for a period of three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ dish@@ le and full @-@ full actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and economic problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the washing road
&quot; a serious problem , it has been to be found for some time , apartments for connecting people who have been acknowledged . &quot;
&quot; for the connection , the municipalities are responsible . &quot;
you need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment spaces .
&quot; the cost of construction , rent or refurb@@ ishment of these accommodations must bear the commun@@ es themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the ministry office to the Comm@@ une and the Job@@ centre .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
for some time searching for a very difficult time .
de facto the administration finds no private apartments .
&quot; it has not been functioning so far , in this case we are instruc@@ ted on private homes , so deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the common apartments must be caught as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers are set up in the washing road .
&quot; however , only with apartments it is not done . &quot;
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , are Reg@@ ine Customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a solid lead , it is tra@@ ine@@ eship , training courses , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and helpl@@ ess@@ ness for refugees and migrants that have to be und@@ ries or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help household master , do charitable work - and that motivated and very neat , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reported . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not only work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a fixed structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
the people would have to develop a belonging feeling .
&quot; so there are offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so we also jump here management and volunteers .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome in Germany and welcome . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make time useful , for example , with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who would eventually develop the feeling that in Ur@@ bach he could not help anyone who would not work , and be un@@ selfish , I will never integrate . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; but troubles@@ hooting there is also , the customer says honestly , &quot; people , with whom nothing goes &quot; . &quot; the work of deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always also to motivate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; Mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two after the recent incidents are fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; &quot; what can be called &quot; &quot; a reset &quot; &quot; but does not want to exclude them out . &quot;
sensi@@ ti@@ ly are the hel@@ pers but already .
these incidents were also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with them , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and community of volunteers must be on site and in the region after activities . &quot;
they are always in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants might come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; this question is clear to answer , shy the policy . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to place them hel@@ pers on site . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we are not yet arrived , where we would like , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees trying to relax .
&quot; Reg@@ ine Customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already playing at the same time , to integrate the previous human beings at a reasonable time . &quot;
&quot; these are around 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , as there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : In@@ bre@@ cher with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew approximately one hour long different areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are magni@@ fied by Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in an apartment house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg .
the inhabitants surprised the two and hit the un@@ hol@@ de into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters large , probably mas@@ hed , both Blue@@ jeans and black cap@@ u@@ zen@@ j@@ lis . &quot;
they escape the direction of the city .
&quot; at the F@@ ahn@@ ing , the police set several strings as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , close to the apartment or during their flight . &quot;
