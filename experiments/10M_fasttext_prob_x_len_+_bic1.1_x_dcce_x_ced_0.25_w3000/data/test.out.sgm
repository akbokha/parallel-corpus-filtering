<seg id="1">Clintons and Trumps economic policies compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the Trade Agreement TTP - who want both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential depositors are at the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in the economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a basic, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">Who, on the role of the state. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns that how the state of economy can harm - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to lay down the economy to death and regulate them, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, claims clump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively go back to regulations, and it is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax approaches - for private people and for businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has certain tasks to fulfil, he has disproportionate opportunities to open and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would be increased for the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the subject of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton almost worsen."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic application in announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure include classical democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the state-critical Teapy-wing of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">"thus, the internal discussions could be sent to Trump."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal power plants and re-use coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil-funding should also be possible in so far protected areas, the Paris climate agreement will announce it."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and call for renewable energy for its investment programme:" a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far away from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpazioness trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them want to isolate the US not from international trade - but simply to protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the should then also be paid better, for example Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage from 7.25 US dollars is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">She wants to increase her to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage needs to be, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics hold him in front of him, so that the deficit deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who at least want to demand for the rich, that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is a part of women who escape alone, almost for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each has a baby in doing the most one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was curious with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother rigid on the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kissing the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until one speaks with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is an area manager of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance offerings in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen were spotted.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the north of Munich, one of the few decentral accommodations for allest women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Family and Munich's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Males do not exist - also not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is an wax in front of the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made their flight experience with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for wars because they are politically persecuted, because they threaten torture or death or because their families send them to Europe as a hope of hope for Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"among women, other reasons for the escape:" many steal themselves secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home country they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary patronage, slavery, or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This is driving them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs for example for a bottle of water demand a sexual act, is no rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, is told,"</seg>
<seg id="31">Even here women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and worst.</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the north of Munich, is traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntary."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to say they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experiences, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often fail to help themselves, there are more accommodations only for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven districts are responsible for the accommodation of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answers with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">In the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken approximately there are such a thing in accommodations of governments.</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Schwaben, alone, women were not separated alone, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, Pressesprecher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Unter- and Mittelfranken there are some common accommodations or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender equality "rights in the European Parliament calls for women to be separated from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that both men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"lack of privacy is lacking men and women together, it can be - continuous - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"laundry rooms should be separated and accessible to women, is available in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel in need of this protective experience, one can read in the urge that there are on the house in Munich."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: a "alliance of external lateral"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended up a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday, to announce their hands and to announce an official end to the last eight months of the long-term war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the golese hall of the St. Petersburg Palace of Palace in receipt, I can not repel the impression that Ankara is willing to deliver that reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, Putin's smiles had an inallible, and he hardly radiates warmth, even for his back behaviour."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, said repeatedly by his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could not count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even further improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described Erdogan as though I had never heard something bad."</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate the opposite rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable radile showed that the State of Russia had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes: the shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border with Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction at the time was sore burned.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to fallen back in the back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger since it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Rebuild the vases becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media had a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed that the Turks would carry the blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of leaders, that Erdogan's own family benefited from illegal oil-trafficking in regions of Syria, who controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He denied this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St. Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look ahead.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia was able to book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the benefits of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is primarily needed all the friends who he can get after spending the last month with a failed state coup d almost his ministry.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number is decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a beltseasonal onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, projected the state remote with cheaper fruit and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish agrarian imported goods will be allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formatched it like:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry with the West since its reaction to the attempted power of power is considered weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the continued resentment takes over the snowfall of the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pitiful to move out of the cool mood and decrease the relationship between Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian President won a bonus in Ankara that he called for the government to call support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace in the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey, one as described by myself an analyst once described," Alliance of external lateral "": two countries that have rejected and treated badly and now. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the largest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently gave itself the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support contradictory pages."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be indicative that after almost three hours of first talks, both presidents spoke at the press conference that they had not even striped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately promised to respond to a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">But after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a perfect discoverer than the NATO member of Turkey the Russian Kampfjet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State would at least talk to each other again.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he was born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he made his degree at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo."</seg>
<seg id="9">On the Kremlin's website (in Russian) it was called on the head of the governing board and the executive director of the government personnel.</seg>
<seg id="10">"he said to Putin:" thank you for your trust. "" "</seg>
<seg id="11">I think that it's the most important task of the government to support your work as a head-head regarding legislative acts and controls for implementing your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday with that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Sergei Ivanov was a long time one of the closest conspirators Vladimir Putin and works like he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief Executive Officer, he was one of the most powerful men of the country."</seg>

<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">This is currently nobody knows.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official claim - that a man who once said to be a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov" it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation to me this very complicated post - you could almost say - complaining for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">As it turns out I have been chairman of the Russian presiding administration for four years and eight months.</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Secretary of Defense.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and how Putin has been a member of the Security Council of KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who created the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his replacement."</seg>
<seg id="28">When Putin got into power he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted the most trusted.</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was believed that Ivanov could become president of Russia since Putin's second term, since there was a third term of Putin's struggle against the constitution."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it is the first of four resolutions on the" "Deckblower" "to end the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30.000 tons.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 loops."</seg>

<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity which require extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in total, almost 79% of the total bracelets in their place and the last section of Decks gets today in Rosyth a subject for the deck, which means that the whole deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Green mean: investors should in future be taken much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1,300 cheap apartments in the next few years? "</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD is proposing a "action concept."</seg>
<seg id="5">Yet controversy is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who will actually build the cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD Group leader Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas, should in future 20 percent of all apartments in social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be developed in the stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the big issue in the city hall is, however, as Bratmann:" how do we deal with investors who want to build on private areas? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build on such areas at least 10 percent, but as 20 per cent of apartments are building as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban construction program, which will cost millions, and must be financed still, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few regulations as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left wants to still harness its conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of its, as viola, a sharpening of the situation on the apartment market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will provide additional tasks in the building administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the professionals.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the program is not entirely clear: for the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"how is the loss of further 1,300 cheap apartments out of which funding will be expired after the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone until the year 2020.</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, such as the planner Speakers of Nicole Palm, should now be bought off-running Bindings from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"furthermore, it would have to be thought to get back home again."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">One stroke can solve the problem.</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the western city a year-end dates run out.</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments you could get back to the prices of affordable housing.</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners to do the housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"since then, the number of social housing in the western city is dramatically increasing, one is removed from the goal of the so-called thoroughfare."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few neighbourhoods.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens count that there will be no movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"group of Chairman Holger Herlitschke says," "for a broad majority the CDU must be with the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">I have focused on more construction sites for family-family dwellings.</seg>

<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course, I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters, initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later, resulting from a drawing series, playcards and other spin-off)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many phenomena of pop culture sunk the interest in the publication of the game in the US, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overthrown the server.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>

<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which has been prosecuted 35.000 users, the Washington Post recently shared with that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of nights followed, which begin every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who is playing Pokémon Go - it only looks the raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public educational campaigns to health, people want to bring about" "30 minutes time" "to get involved" "from the sofa," "because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport can not be overevaluated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sport, reduces its chances of suffering from cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical exercise helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the Wonderful thing of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors, making them fun."</seg>
<seg id="22">"three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine, as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even exclude new friendships in the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there is also metric pipers, who have always to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should it be?</seg>
<seg id="27">It has been a breakthrough.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps were able to follow our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to drive sport as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will leave with the time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"because of Pokemons's success, however, there will be more games to unite the apps and virtual reality with the activist in the real world and will help many people in hunting to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subordinated his immune system and litgereflex of a serious test - by getting some of the dirty and most rudimentary places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moderator and Travel-author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shoff his course on an Euro-Schein, a railing in Piccadilly Circus, a sinking button, and a public telephone in Russia to prove the resilience of its immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of the nocking of each object, he used a leuminometer to show up and show us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the flush-chool of a traction toilette, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely removable, but actually in a kitchen rinse more bad bacteria."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright talked to physicians and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria, as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately left nothing, what he dded, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright has been known to test the resilience of his intestines by travelling through the world, and ate great things as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to rinsing skid of restrooms, the task applied its immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"he told me:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns, and I put all kinds of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sluent. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In film he definitely did justice to his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">Its trial line showed a leuminous number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to that, the leuminometer is made of fresh hands less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to cut off after their leuminous number over 4000 units was, while freshly caught hands one of less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio produced the travel agent" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," which shows the bacterial number in different places like the bathroom "</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," That comes to the worst that I have gerent in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing of mutinous than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">"I will do nothing here, because it is indoors here."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with Finnish manufacturer of dairy products valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company accused Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of gut bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valid Senior Venice President for snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says," We wanted to offer the consumer something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to see and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We carried crazy brainstormings by saying that we told "Lass us Ian to call us Ian.</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking only about the products we wanted to put them into a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our daily environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide more information about an interesting manner.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the direction of the film, added:" let it say to me - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he would like some of the things I have reliant on, like the ekelective Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was simpler to bring Ian to join them and others in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">"glad, that we recorded some of these dirty treats on film."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of Valio conducted survey conducted in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents lactic acid bacteria, particularly with the well-being of the stomach and intestine and 58 percent said that they may use at least occasionally products used to lactic lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="36">"instead, government president Jörg Schmidt placed upon a request of Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, with the reference to the restaurant, the restaurant also benefited from the advantages of the location at the B 27 now, it also has the drawbacks that carry out through the rehabilitation."</seg>

<seg id="24">Some still works unexploited and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some points - in the unequal treatment of thought, for example - is the question: what does that have to do with certainty and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks were from Ansbach and Würzburg's refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"moreover, many people were worried about the high refugees concerned about security."</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men middle ages love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you move to the commentary box, in order to skipped it under the pseudonym non-samic men with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the widespread revival of sound plates did not want to greet a boom in millennials that want to welcome the novelty of physical objects but on Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who have recently purchased a record are all pre-view at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer Group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables retain their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it alone time to spend (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But agree the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the midst of a busy road in Soho-e, a modest gray suit and wild, before I steal, my hands keep, and something determinative as:" so, let's have a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos is slowly in his charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part, where I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, which I received by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle aged) to the Reckless Records (data number: eight men middle ages, a woman, presumably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the stores to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, question I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I already appreciate," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this sound plates, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I am not followed immediately), dress up the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses such a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of its available income: he is now able to buy panels that he was unable to afford, when they appeared and again articles, which he sold, when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I Buy are from the late 1960s, early 70ies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy the sheets, rather introverted and gladly spend time, and adds:" I smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my aster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25 that works with Sister Ray, believes also that many customers that he meets on the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medienhpe, who have heard about the comeback and have prompted to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually do so by 1998 or in 1999 of their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell their CDs to buy their records now," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">That would explain the boom to trailers of a specific age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to recognize that record stores a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to the WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the outgoing payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans will feel overwhelmed by the digital world and would like to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound slats, of objects, the happy jugenderinnings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">That is with me as a collector and I think it's so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to mentally engaged.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" flutes an employee from a record stack. "</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who have bought a record last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found out that 41% have a record player that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, do not have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the report report, I would probably look very worried while at the stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works with sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle age), has noticed a" trophy "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only came here clean and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead Schallplate so that I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more product-hand, less musicantile."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, who only slowly come."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stop that has devoted the gramophone almost a whole floor, has a boured audience, when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women middle aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the aforementioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesizer- and sexcpacked pop instead of experimental jazz, from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity with the customer."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them sees strange, but nave mental traumas are difficult to set when you stand next to someone 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and looks at the variation of the plates that are available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more likely to get a shop paddummel as a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"she does not deserve much, so the collector of plates does not have a real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">It's easy to listen to music from a computer or in other way but the beauty of plates is... it drives with a loved sigh.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a shop, which is said that a new generation of record lovers is to have inspired: urban outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I may give the impression to muck the jeans-hotly, I observed a group of young teammers who group themselves for a moment to buy polaroid cameras before a father and daughter to think about a crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody looks at them - maybe because they are purely decorative, some as far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">But considering that any attraction for these items will mean more money to the sector and some customers could send to the depths of sohos for more so there is nothing to complain.</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most for luxury items such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research took place that the results of YouGov vote, they let, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and records, which exist in reality, record business and online-forks."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the stroll through records of Berwick Street and the leaf through plates, while they avoid the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator, that protrudes nothing to the shoulders of the middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, Spirit, Health: singing seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the singing has accompanied URSEL Kipp already accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, at the magisterium study she won the Fach Music, and today the 78-year-old sings in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," describes them. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a sample they feel balanced, cheerful and overall living, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in the next door, they are doing something good about their health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"since Singen is the same from several perspectives, a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors singing in chorus and share with like-minded people's joy in music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular meetings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often, social and familiar structures solve the age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">This experience has also made URSEL Kipp in their choir: to speak and organize themselves on the others and learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together.</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For doing so you are practicing a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">"whoever calls on his lungs regularly, is not so fast in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to receiving the sound of the voice at the age, Singen is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people Singen has often a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz of the Federal Association of Seniors and senior organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in older generations the joint venture had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure."</seg>
<seg id="17">"lenz frequently observes that singing or hearing of songs with older people awakes many memories, often associated with positive emotions of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"due to Liedtexte and especially melodies, even the ill-ill will be denied."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head will also require a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">To focus simultaneously on your own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people who live alone, practice alone, do not just focus on yourself."</seg>
<seg id="22">Another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the chorus means Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">"also, self-esteem is growing through singing in the chorus."</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show yourself: if I'm long for something, I will better and grow over me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent, betrays Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you do not sing alone - at 50 sinking people, who listens to you, when a note goes next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, seniors have various possibilities, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"sings someone from the acquaintances in a senior orenchyma, you can just join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews over choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Who wants to sing in an ecclesiastic choir can turn directly to the church or the Church's Church.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who do not have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbours can ask for help with the Internetrecherche."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who desire to sing, should necessarily join a choir, betraying Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Sing the soul well and has something liberating - this applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="3">"we see at the" "identity movement" "objections to efforts against the free democratic basic order," said Constitutional Court Hans-Georg Maate the German press agency in Berlin. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"thus, Zuwother Islamic faith or from the Middle East are diffused by the extremist way."</seg>
<seg id="5">That's why we are watching the movement now.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" identity movement "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it applies against" Multikulti-Wahn, "" uncontrolled mass migration "" and the "loss of one's own identity by alienation."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, Germany, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identity "already."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maate said, his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the" identity movement "try to get their target group out where it stands," said the Constitutional Court. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general, extremists attempt to address them with youthful language, often with poppable music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The identities of Islamists are just like right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not commercial advertising for your own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda is meant to address the people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are very susceptible in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"at last, there had been reports from several federal states reports about contacts of" "identity" "to Afforpoliticians."</seg>
<seg id="18">Maate said that he did not find any knowledge.</seg>
<seg id="19">For the constitutional protection possible contacts of this type are relevant only from a certain point.</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Affor- by certain individuals, who are extremist, changing their goal, and so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is, therefore, if such people have a controlled influence on the party."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not evident.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase of legitimate criminal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees, Madined, he would not speak of new rights in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that there can be right-steroristic structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">It gave the group 'Old School Society' or the free group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that further legitimate groupings or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugees or attacks from other far-right motives plan."</seg>
<seg id="27">But a clear or across Europe-wide control of legal aphorism is not visible.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created at the regional level or social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"concerned, Maate expressed that many overstrikes went to the account of men who had not yet come into appearance before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the Tatversuspects at attacks on asylum have not been known as criminal, politically motivated or adherents to the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have committed crimes committed previously with right-wing extremists, who were perhaps politically indifferent, or have chosen the example CDU, SPD or left, but who have not been radicalised by far-right moods."</seg>

<seg id="6">All missteps will arrive to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of using the app Blackface footing or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week some users suggested a filter that gave them slaughter, false teeth and pened cheeks, there was some critics a racist cartoon by Asiatic -" yellowing. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether this repetitive controversy surpassed on a larger problem that the company with diversity has.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widely used on Wednesday, with reports from The verge and Motherboard, a day after Snaplechat that the feature would have disabled."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was meant to be a homage to Anime characters and not as caricature of Asian.</seg>

<seg id="2">Military-member of the United States Central Command has modified official information to draw an optimist image of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as the actual state of affairs had allowed an investigation committee in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the provisional report, created by a task force of Republican members of the dispute, intelligence services, and the defense budget, reports on large discontent among Central Command intelligence services, reported how prevoiced their estimations to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"news-service information, which were typically constricted by high-level CentCom commansions, were reported regularly a more positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism and the actual conditions in place were allowed and were consistently positive as the analyses of other news services," cited a newspaper article. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what has happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when poor analyses will be presented to our political leaders," Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The faults in the CentCom range up to the top tip of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows more detailed problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the education of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct reference to that government tips given by Obama instructions, it shows how analysts saw themselves exposed to the pressure from their superiors, an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command Press statements, statements and statements before the Congress were clearly more positive than it corresponds to the facts."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom has publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls will begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mossul, the second largest city in Iraq, continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congress of Kansas, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of Central Command changed the following reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Republican smelling the Task Force in Life, after being assigned to them, that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by detailed findings during the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigation of CentCom reports are underway due to the general manager of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">The democratic members of the Intelligence Committee released their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015 the CentCom created an overly restricted process for the creation of educational services to Isil and the Iraqi security services," gave the highest level of democrat in Kommitme, Member in the House of Representatives Adam B. ship, in an opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Ship," hesitated the publication of official reports, "ashamed the morality under analysts and," "gave little room for deviating opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but Mr. Ships and Democrats gave to, no references to an intervention in the White House at CentCom analysts at a" "specific political opinion". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by "The Daily Beast."</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported by investigations by the General Inspector of the Pentagon, which were added to complaints of CentCom analysts."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Lt. Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a press review of the Pentagon, gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment any reports of Congress, while the investigation of the general inspectors were still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also assumed that" experts sometimes have diverging opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important themes of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigators have further impact on the question of a successful air campaign led by American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion which is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the allegations of last year, however, have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on Central Command for honest invitations of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism regarding the secret information about the Islamic state remind of constraints of more than ten years ago, as a CentCom Analyst, Gregory Hooker, a writing about how the then government headed by George W.

<seg id="2">"one day after they shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match against India that Americans have won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five gates in two games should actually be a memorable achievement, but Bam (27) said they could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their gates in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, that knows them: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equal in their group with the Britons in the first place, which remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already been qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which the two teams will win the first and second place within their group from six teams."</seg>

<seg id="20">"India was gone without victory in the tournament, but the team showed itself surprisingly tough and held the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>

<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly feeling inconsistent and inescapable, a rapid season on competition and aspirations."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as if the olympic Fackel itself would be a burning stone, which is passed from the bracelet to the swimmer to triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot switch on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the talk of your neighbors in the waiting time in the coffee shop without having Simone Biles, Katie Leapy or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there are Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a woman swarm with dimples, could have been quite under these known names that would be sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and wellbeing TV advertising, if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even feeder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic Flame is not illuminated every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air brush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the flipper and may prevail over it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but when I do modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jump already since 2000 a olympic event, when it was in Sydney its debut, the last 16 years was so pointed out that many who had questioned, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasportway."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the U.S. athletes sent to competition, there has never been a medal in the trampoline and had a athletes until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unresolved ear for a Clownsschule than the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a built-up enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the cartoonous tremor of its never to end cloudy, but also the Grazie of the turnaround and diving, the two sports that it essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, meaning as much as" "springboard". ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging winners jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (rotating, yeast, and saltos) before they land at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiad, they are assessed according to the execution, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common olympic vector is straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallillenario must continue in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes up to the destination, sometimes up and back, up and down at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"not only do you chase the Ziellinie or the output wall, but in the television transmission also another height: that of the world or the Olympiarekords."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the purposeful pursuit is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I think of myself when looking at these games as something simply.</seg>
<seg id="30">From this the trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A downward movement is not the target.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she preload, apparently weightless like an astronaut, go up, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It can only be Zen as the competition among the Olympic Games only.</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators are demanding political changes in Ethiopia to prevent violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protested during the clashes with the police have been killed by cheers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to be together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government shook the country and spread themselves in more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people rushed to the streets and slowed fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The answer of the government was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave me that policemen were shot at seventy unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the re-run videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety people strike young people with staves, while they were forced to make a handstand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for a further investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this land and in the future it will be even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and secret services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organizations constantly continued oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been limited, although dissidents were effective for silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or in prison, or driven into the desert of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these not have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Ms youm Teshome, a lecturer in Central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous ailments that cover everything from the ground use up to the liturgy in relation to power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this jagged, controversial line requested in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analyst fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden in recent years have been more or less forced to exploit the turbulence over the last few years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years of destruction can now explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as bilberry smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even when the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they are doing at regular intervals, especially at protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies, who are able to hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians have announced that they gathered themselves to their protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from Aegean of Ethiopia mainly Christian highlands, in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and living in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But even this is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the tiger that accounts for about 6 percent of the population, which are dominant in the military, in the secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the disturbances is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death in a not publicied disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was particularly interested in using early signs of dissatisfaction and to use special officers to work opponents and make them inharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of the Northern Ethiopian region, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services of the tiger-controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia continued to have such a mover in 2005, after thousands of elections were protested by the government, which was apparently stolen from the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"while the following flops were killed many protesters, even though it were less than in recent months and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, as well as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this has not prevented the intention of the internal missal of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesting in Gondar, a shamanic city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the tiger is becoming more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst say that protests in the US and other Western allies bring in a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenant over the neighboured Somalia, even though they recently concluded that they closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he doesn't want his allies collapses in a already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin ridge."</seg>

<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the linguistic boundaries in politics and then move back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then, if necessary," clarify "according to what the reaction falls." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observes the language of both candidates. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland: the oldest vertebrtier is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie often come only in the winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Grönlandhaie get only after 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely floating the Greenland-shark at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour he comes at an average just 1.220 meters wide."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it happens, the five meters long animal accelerates to satte 2.6 km / h - and with this maximum speed is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this long-term coined lifestyle seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the journal Science "anyway from a Greenland-shark that could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist suspected long, that Greenland-haie are stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacking the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are difficult to observe, eventually they live mainly in the polar sea front of the thinly populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">Because they prefer water temperatures around six degrees Celsius they usually appear on the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="16">"according to the lifestyle of the Greenland-haie, researchers know little."</seg>
<seg id="17">Their time pentpentempo Maze them when they enrolled out six animals with a transmitter.</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had lucked the jawbone of a young ice-bears."</seg>
<seg id="19">"possibly, they chase sleepy animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek carcass, which are tortured from higher layers of water."</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland-haie who took fishermen from 2010 and 2013 to Greenland or Spitsbergen from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of animals, they analyzed with the carbon-14 method of relieving the sharks of sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye-line is already born before the birth of the sharks, which the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of carbon-14 in the linsenkers.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should therefore lie after the early 1960s, as an atomic weapon try larger quantities of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in that with 220 centimeters of length, the third-smallest animals contained the lens with a low excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday in 2012 during his investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-haie had normal carbon-14 quantities in their relieving, on the other hand, normal carbon-14 volumes, which is created by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock showed for a 493 centimetres long Greenland-shark an old age of 335 years, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old during the record-Hai."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females then get offspring only then, if they are longer than four meters, was well-known."</seg>
<seg id="30">The researchers were able to assign the length to an age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals at 392 centimeters probably stood on the cusp of the sexually mature and his age with 156 years has been determined, Greenland with the multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">Even this should be the case for vertebrates at present world-ord.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme mainly live in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 years old Greenland-whale, in whose speck at the neck a 120 years old harpoon tip, was captured prior to Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, there is often also the organism of the animals living on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and alarms slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"to keep in the cold water warm, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">"the volume is growing much faster than its surface, by which the animal tempered heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a grams of mouse is therefore much bigger than in a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal thus lives more dangerous, and should concentrate on getting as many descendants as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">A very big animal should rather invest his resources into a long life.</seg>

<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies der NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus in the basis of tools and algorithms that are similar to those of climate research.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether Venus could have applied with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that the slow reversal of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>

<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably pointed out more dry areas than de earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accomodate life and protect them from faster evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus benefited also from a sun that was 30 percent of the matter.</seg>

<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey conducted by Malware-defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months were at least once, partly several victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the goal of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of victims paid by the perpetrators demanded by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>

<seg id="16">"but where in private users the personal photo database is at stake, the company is about sensitive customer data or project databases, without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls if a ransomware suggests."</seg>

<seg id="21">"but 80 to 90 percent of companies, which pay, get their data once more."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the call of the perpetrators in the light of a standstill."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">In a current study the security researchers of F-Secure the utility areas and contact with blackmailers investigated and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a sort of customer service in order to take more money.</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their sacrifice to chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, are free-accessible support sites or decode free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and will redeem private people after payments of a few hundred euro, companies need to pay partly hard and five-digit sums, in order to redeem their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from the ransomware extortion, the hacker becomes more professional and share the work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from Antivirus-provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware around one week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"more likely, it is that it is about three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their pollutants then in the form of a software building to the actual blackout.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by the malware themselves, consulting and additional tools for a unique, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"included in the package is a adaptive tool, so that smaller configurations, look and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackser then look for further hackers in order to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so you log in one of the forums on the underground, buy the set of a criminal and put another way to install the software on as many PCs."</seg>
<seg id="35">The payment is made per incalculated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually overput the criminals then spammer with the spread," "explains Wisniewski."</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that ensure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies in the Malwarebytes survey will rely on Ransomware to repel the Ransomware using file-back-ups and scans software.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if encryption of data alone is not sufficient threat to successful detection, the perpetrators instead, with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-Chief Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"with this, damages are still higher than before, according to the type of data."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators would also be able to make completely new goals on the internet of things."</seg>
<seg id="43">"at the Hackerconference Defcon demonstrated the security researcher, as they could get an with the Internet for theres Thermostat under their control."</seg>
<seg id="44">In the middle of winter the activation of such a troubled heating could be well worth a ransom.</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then instead of heating in the future block a whole production way in a factory, Ransomware could also be a subject in the Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"at night you have been around forever, at night you are awake for hours, in the morning we no longer think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults sleeping and over ten per cent experience their sleep often or permanently."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disturbances, and there are many causes behind them, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weaving, board member of the German Society for Sleeping Research and Schlafes."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand, but the insomnia is never, so an input and sleepdisorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just that all sleep many people feel unsatisfying or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, board member in the German Hauser association with practice in the German-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind it can organic, mental or discontinued factors, but also drugs are stuck."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the disorder expression of another condition.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awaken is common especially for depression," says Weaple. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors would like each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a slipped disk, can be bad, wake all two to three hours and start pondering, about everyday problems and worry, gives Weaply an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"that leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should one be with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who will not sleep well over a month from one month to at least three nights per week and is compromised on the day, should go to the doctor, betrays Weaple."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can be quite different: it is downcast, tired, unexhausted, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical discomfort such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleeping disorder, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options, among other things behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or also medicines - classical intimings occur only in exceptional and at the most for two weeks - question."</seg>
<seg id="22">"low dormitories are rare in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of interdisciplinary Medical Center of Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"that is why one should say in sleep problems at first, in front of the household doctor, betrays Weaple."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified with investigations whether the problems have a bodily cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep laboratory, and what happens there?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"to examine in the sleep laboratory emergencies, for example with snoring with respirator, with pathological day fatigue, with sleepting or if one does not find the cause of a sleepy disorder, says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">"actually, it is not necessary to prepare for the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">After the cabling one goes to the bed of his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes in the body, one carries a nose-glasses, a chest strap and a antennae at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can people cope with the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of spots where you can get a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weasons count on: regular bedtime and resistible periods, not too long in bed, don't sleep well, don't watch television for sleeping, alcohol, and at night do not look at the clock - then one starts immediately to reckon, and that is all and certainly not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects are a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist authority is not the main attraction of many inhabitants: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who runs here three children, especially from the police presence."</seg>

<seg id="23">"no other street was mentioned this year so often together with the words" "left-autonomous violence". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason why not all neighbours can view this as a problem, could be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body breaking are projected almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees.</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"furthermore, it is a social worker."</seg>
<seg id="4">Since July Annika Deuster was the refugee camp for Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="5">The social pedagogin supports the management team around Achim Grockenberg.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact person for all actors: refugees, the work of refugee assistance, administration, authorities and who else still miter."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than grateful that deuschle now is, the jealous Wollmilchsau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in such a way, some - less spotting than on the multitude of wish-areas aim - meant that the administration wanted to write the site."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, associated with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just an experienced Wollmilchsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"administrative work is not its central area," "Annika deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes and network activity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been here for around six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent place for a period of three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deudishle and full-full actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and economic problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem, it has been to be found for some time, apartments for connecting people who have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">"for the connection, the municipalities are responsible."</seg>
<seg id="19">You need to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartment spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of construction, rent or refurbishment of these accommodations must bear the communes themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the ministry office to the Commune and the Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">For some time searching for a very difficult time.</seg>
<seg id="24">De facto the administration finds no private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"it has not been functioning so far, in this case we are instructed on private homes, so deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, the common apartments must be caught as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers are set up in the washing road.</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, only with apartments it is not done."</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, are Regine Customer and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a solid lead, it is traineeship, training courses, school courts, one-euro jobs and helplessness for refugees and migrants that have to be undries or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help household master, do charitable work - and that motivated and very neat, as Annika Deuschle reported."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, it is not only work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">The people would have to develop a belonging feeling.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there are offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So we also jump here management and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome in Germany and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can make time useful, for example, with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who would eventually develop the feeling that in Urbach he could not help anyone who would not work, and be unselfish, I will never integrate."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but troubleshooting there is also, the customer says honestly," people, with whom nothing goes "." the work of deuschle and customer is therefore always also to motivate others. "</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "Mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two after the recent incidents are fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "says Regine customer quite clearly," "what can be called" "a reset" "but does not want to exclude them out."</seg>
<seg id="50">Sensitily are the helpers but already.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents were also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the attacks bring them completely in call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with them," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and community of volunteers must be on site and in the region after activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that soon a new push of refugees and migrants might come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"this question is clear to answer, shy the policy."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to place them helpers on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we are not yet arrived, where we would like," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees trying to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">"Regine Customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher are already playing at the same time, to integrate the previous human beings at a reasonable time."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are around 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, as there are no simple answers."</seg>
