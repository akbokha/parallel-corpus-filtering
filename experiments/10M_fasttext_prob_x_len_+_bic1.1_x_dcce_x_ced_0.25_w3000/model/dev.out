Obama with Netanyahu
the relation between Obama and Netanyahu has not been ro@@ dent .
the two wanted to discuss the implementation of the international agreement and Teheran &apos;s destabili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; in this encounter , however , it is also possible to deal with the conflict with the Palestinians and the systematic two @-@ state solution . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been tense for years .
Washington has critic@@ ised the long @-@ lasting settlement of Israel and for a lack of commitment during the peace process .
&quot; by the efforts used by Obama to deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship of the two further deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held the invitation of Re@@ public@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the talk was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this with regard to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
in a emergency call he conf@@ esses Professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in a call , Professor Sh@@ annon told a slightly z@@ itt@@ y voice of the police , that he got shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited and he said the family @-@ contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officers found the Lei@@ che of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was not signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s no notice that he &apos;s staying in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , signed up 300 miles to the school grounds where he shot a popular history of history , eth@@ ane Schmidt , at the door of his office and killed him . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ tic@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff member heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that he had made the fatal emergency call for it sometime .
by the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took life when the police took him .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what &apos;s motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators on both ends of the state , as well as what students and collaborators who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were enjoying their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he has no history of violence or criminal record . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself was mentioned in a book written by him in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; , &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both established in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose curriculum is 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies to be problematic .
&quot; he was a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers who &apos;s he was very excited and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ kel Sy@@ kes , said that lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
he had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons for health reasons and said that he had some health problem .
this year he made only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in employment policies of the university means that the promotion , for which he had worked so hard , would be no guarantee of an automatic way to an application as assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; he said William La@@ For@@ ge &apos;s universal president William La@@ For@@ ge , he ignor@@ se nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions which he or she could not answer .
&quot; after the flight out of the campus , the police found later Lam@@ bs track , when he returns to Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , he &apos;s self confident with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house approximately one mile south of his parents on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi ; said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why lamb was going to this house , but Johnson said that she didn &apos;t know people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the region .
&quot; he began his work at the university , which began 3,@@ 500 students in a city with around 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , and taught geography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he graduated in the spring of education in the spring of education .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends of Lam@@ bs proved to be intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; she came to Carla H@@ air@@ ston , she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when she met through joint friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the co@@ ole older guy who tried to teach her guitar contest for some years . &quot;
he was at that time the women &apos;s sha@@ kes .
&quot; all the girls mol@@ ten until he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; he &apos;s said in the emergency , &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning that lived with them in the brick house , that is adjacent to a bath in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he had never met , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail , he heard that he &apos;s interested in music and played Blues . &quot;
he &apos;s met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up three years ago both in a summer @-@ year market .
&quot; later , they played together one way or the other . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings to her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lighted bar near Gau@@ tier , said he &apos;s Lamb and Pr@@ ist@@ ss Night ki@@ cked off at night 5th September for the last time , after he had finished his guitar and Mund@@ arg@@ ik@@ iel , a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign of anything that something was wrong .
&quot; simply a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the places and they were sitting together .
I mean they both had a good sense of jo@@ kes .
&quot; Schmidt , the t@@ ote Professor , headed the First semester @-@ seminar and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was President of his Society and the Student Committee .

&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans have contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to re@@ mi@@ tig@@ ate that the police argued that he had shot the emergency , and that lamb in his Not@@ t@@ lement was described as his wife , but there &apos;s no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;

&quot; the premiere of &quot; &quot; Back to the Future &quot; &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox . &quot;
for personal reasons it was remarkable .

UN leader says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ moon adm@@ its his response to Russia enhanced military support for Syria : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of nearly five years of lasting conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Secretary again calls for all parties , including the shared UN Security Council to unite and promote an inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;

&quot; B@@ an called on the five permanent members to show equal solidarity and unity in tackling the crisis in Syria , which they proved to be in achieving a nuclear agreement with Iran . &quot;
8 Re@@ quest values which show that Donald Tr@@ ump will take seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it did not work ( nor ) . &quot;
ten of the last eleven national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate art .
of course it is still too early in the election period .
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump will probably win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphas@@ ise that at that time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys tour was given to a rise of Herman C@@ ain , none of which had only one state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ side groups like Je@@ b Bush &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognize the m@@ umps per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow to fall . &quot;
here are some current survey values that indicate that the real estate gu@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
accum@@ ulate interference values have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in the middle of June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two out of ten Re@@ public@@ ans had the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative comment .
and these figures keep in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ p@@ ac &apos;s voting in Iowa last week found that 60 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans have a good opinion of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ vot@@ er GO@@ P would be happy with cl@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey by CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of Re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; enthusiastic &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; , &quot; if Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; just two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; &quot; enthusias@@ tically &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the next one in Love ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they are &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the favourite of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the re@@ public@@ ans sees the m@@ umps temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critici@@ zed for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the Re@@ public@@ ans have found the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pron@@ ain@@ ment of the nation , the State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of Republi@@ can think , that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ p@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think he did not have the personality to operate effectively , and almost six of 10 independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per was not in the White House , so ABC / post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they place their jel@@ ly , hold Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is closest to GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say according to a survey by CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
that is a change since the end of July that four out of ten will put her money on Je@@ b Bush .
complete Dis@@ closure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans had thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors to view the m@@ umps campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans have gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump defeats almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the frag@@ mented field is likely to contribute to a m@@ umps tour , while anti @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ support is diff@@ used for more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ use . &quot;
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will be harvested for health support . &quot;
&quot; he has 13 points ahead of C@@ arly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points , and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ der and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head racing with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that suggests him ?
Ben Car@@ son would take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on &apos;s head .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says they have formed their mind .
&quot; a new survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters who support tr@@ ump will say that they have fixed their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can actually say , never change the mind . &quot;
&quot; 46 percent said that they leave the door open , in order to switch to other candidates . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , Tr@@ umps is strongest in the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with Tr@@ ump in immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign launched two months ago from Mexico &quot; &quot; rap@@ ist &quot; , &quot; was the immigration and ful@@ crum at the public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are worried that the bom@@ bas@@ tic utter@@ ance of Tr@@ ump @-@ Hisp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and damage the New Year &apos;s efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / Post survey of Monday , six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say that they are in agreement with complaints at issues relating to immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the spotlight , it will apparently do Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
the frustration over the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
&quot; on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , meanwhile , amounts to about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mont@@ g@@ ags survey of ABC / post ; they prefer a political out@@ sider to treat someone with government experience .
and they are also fur@@ ious to Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa , out of two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa re@@ public@@ ans have been frustrated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; upset . &quot;
Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential @-@ seekers in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - overlooking the Nord@@ se@@ e@@ watt .
&quot; in the street costs an square meter of a tree @-@ roof@@ ed house , on average 7@@ 3.@@ 300 euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt is the offer limited to units of nature , it means in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special clim@@ ates one square meter most cost .
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not very little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany top @-@ dwelling , one of the prices comes before a price to pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers released a list of the most exclusive German residential sites - with square me@@ ter@@ ies in obli@@ qu@@ eting heights .
&quot; there are several dozens of one thousand Euros de per square meter , well @-@ known . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : Munich is in fact not at the hel@@ m , here . &quot;
Champions League : Bavaria @-@ Dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
doubt scor@@ er in Pi@@ re@@ aus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a happier hit by Thomas Müller eb@@ ra@@ ined with FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champions Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e got a dream start to the FC Bayern in Hex@@ en@@ kes@@ sel from Pir@@ ro , into the &quot; mission Milan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their spectacle in the Champions League at the Greek record Champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to the trav@@ eller double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Gö@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth start of results in series will be the first step towards Fin@@ als on 28 May 2016 in Italy , where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally bring the Hen@@ kel@@ pot@@ t to Munich on the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; Müller received at his 28 results in the Champions League at Bavaria &apos;s leading mi@@ tigation of Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ atten@@ s Roberto which , who allowed one as stro@@ ke @-@ thought shot of the world &apos;s grand@@ master . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate her , &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ame was promised in front of the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ aki stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich stopped word . &quot;
they showed a focused and committed presentation without it seems to shine .
&quot; Piraeus had won his most recent six home@@ games in the top class , among them against well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 stum@@ bled here also Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , was defeated in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went v@@ ented with their aggressive efforts but often too mon@@ stro@@ us to work .
the attacks were often introduced by si@@ ege out on the left of the Costa Costa initiated by the former Braunschwei@@ g Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
&quot; Müller had more luck from the right side , when his flan@@ k struck out of the right hem@@ or@@ ch in the left corner . &quot;
at the 6@@ 7th minute the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half one had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms , Brown hit the ball in Poland from the line ( 26 ) . &quot;
then by direct remove the go@@ alie &apos;s Roberto with the knee ( 3@@ 5. ) .
&quot; although Bavaria was accustomed to the dominant game , Piraeus was able to put Piraeus . &quot;
to go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel New but was going over .
so about when he got a shot of ide@@ alism about the lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) .
&quot; before new he left Gu@@ ardi@@ ola a quadru@@ ple chain with David Al@@ aba in the center alongside Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Got@@ tz@@ e , back to muscular problems back to the ca@@ der , first sat outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup winner has only given green light after the final training , &quot; said Sport@@ ing Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from this is already mal@@ ignant . &quot;
&quot; during the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he took King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the Lie@@ uten@@ ant Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late to Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything realized by El@@ f@@ meters , Müller still got a dr@@ on . &quot;
in front of the game I came to Kra@@ w@@ at in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of some stretches of Bavaria &apos;s fans in their audience @-@ block obviously had prov@@ oked the fans of Ho@@ re@@ aus with words and gest@@ ures , attacked the security forces and went with stro@@ kes against the Munich &apos;s supporters . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ Fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth . &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , not only does the lung , but also the teeth - that will establish a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : when res@@ igns at risk the risk decreases quickly .
smokers have a clearly higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is one of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutri@@ tional Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers should lose the risk of losing their teeth early to the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3,@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23@@ 300 atten@@ dees .
&quot; major causes for dental failure are ca@@ vities and inflammation of the g@@ um , empha@@ sizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphasize the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and dental loss is therefore going back to frequent g@@ um @-@ g@@ ums with smokers .
&quot; not clear , to what extent smoking is also the risk of dental c@@ aries increased . &quot;
people who listen to smoking could reduce their risk but within a short amount of time do the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research .
&quot; it could last for over ten years , until the hazard again to the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich explained by the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; you must convince people of this to be non @-@ smoking , stated teacher leader H@@ eine Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lung and vessels and leads to our knowledge even to good dental health up to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population are affected by g@@ il@@ ess@@ ness in the age of 65 to 74 years . &quot;
earlier investigations have already pointed out that smoking at risk for early retirement .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ inning the findings .

&quot; for all building projects in the district of Cologne , the museum is always added as a specialist for Archae@@ ological Phen@@ om@@ an@@ esis . &quot;
in the third part of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ards the archae@@ ologists were now found .
&quot; text documents had already been known , that in place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church explaining Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; beside remains of the fortress and the cherry tree , a cemetery with around 350 graves were discovered that was probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
&quot; the disputed private arbitration institutions for disputes between corporations and states is therefore to be replaced by a more transparent system , corresponding in its functioning significantly more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; stated the commission@@ er Cecilia Malm@@ ström today . &quot;
the Swedish has to launch the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the USA .
the German government announced support .
TTIP is to create the largest free @-@ trade zone of the world with 800 million people .
&quot; plans for the reform of the current arbitration proceedings should be explained in concrete terms that the EU states and the US , jointly , select independent judges for a new investment court . &quot;
&quot; they are supposed to come from the EU , the US and from third countries . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ en Deb@@ at with the premiere of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s debut in making the premi@@ ership of the Prime Minister is anticipated . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n is supposed to make his debut in the prime minister of the Prime Minister and set him on with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six @-@ described questions shortly after noon , with his performance by the media probably and the Labour MEPs . &quot;
he called &quot; less Theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he can skip some meetings to leave them to his colleagues .
&quot; this meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the shadow kab@@ ooks and his speech at TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the decision of the Labour Office has prov@@ oked itself with a commemor@@ ative ceremony to mark the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ isms of a number of T@@ ory Members and is at the center of several front @-@ pages stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s decision , not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; in &quot; comm@@ ing silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s shadow , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two News@@ night @-@ program , he told the Labour Party to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers have refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s leaders , and she calls himself on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Party was originally supported as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also in the Labour Party and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns statements about the European Union &apos;s position and the limit of threads . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference for Labour to put on the whole idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ Labour and R@@ ent minister , stated that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is to be the fifth Labour leader who David Cameron since he has been a T@@ ory leader in the last decade over the Disp@@ atch Box in the European Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader who promised a different policy approach , says that he has given &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions on Mr Cameron and has given him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP said that the ch@@ marking of the Prime Minister is to confront and confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he has engaged in &quot; &quot; perc@@ ussion &quot; &quot; and that he has engaged in serious problems like poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , who is represented the shadows of economics at him if he is not participating - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally seize the word and that he John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the under@@ house , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became leaders in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s style in the style of &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; , &quot; but some years later he adm@@ its to him that he failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television first in 1990 , the question was regarded with prime minister as a most important bar@@ ometer for the ruling part of a leader and his position under his parliament@@ ar@@ ism , although critics did have argued that they had become a caricature and would have far enough reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by accelerated pay@@ growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose @-@ like according to data , which show an increase in wage growth in the United Kingdom . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller . &quot;
between May and July earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year .
&quot; this rate has been the fastest growing rate since 2009 , and brought to the point of interest at the time of the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar at $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was logged up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to 1.@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 index with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % on 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding stock on the market and made a jump of 20 % after the acquisition of the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v had been received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and combine brands like Bud@@ ě@@ jo@@ ice , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; Bur@@ berry shares were according to encouraging messages from the competition group for luxury goods , ri@@ chem@@ ont 0,@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
Ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat out all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reg@@ isters growth .
&quot; Glen@@ core @-@ climbed by 5 % after the alp , said that it has taken 2,5 billion $ by a share res@@ ale as part of his strategy of debt recovery . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company MON@@ DI were the biggest los@@ ers in the index , and by a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had set his assessment for rating the company &quot; rating on &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.@@ 1 % , after the sports@@ wear company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6,@@ 6 million for the first half . &quot;
the chef of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &apos; employ more power in the pockets of potential customers &apos; .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this transaction will deliver the higher labour costs at his company , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D sports , he added , and that could mean there are fewer extra jobs . &quot;

met@@ cash launches ground @-@ speed campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ -
met@@ eo seeks to protect the Ig@@ A branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
&quot; food wholes@@ al@@ ers Met@@ cash has launched a ground@@ work campaign , to defend the market share of Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion . &quot;
&quot; during Al@@ di , the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia will be prepared early next year , strengthen met@@ cash and Ig@@ A supermarkets , their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand Ig@@ A by mainstream media and marketing via social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like Eis@@ maker S@@ imm@@ o out of D@@ uns@@ borough that distributed in Ig@@ A @-@ stores , and Lad@@ in owners , the cheapest tickets for the South Australian football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to publish more details of its defensive strategy on September 29 when the wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investment strategy . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot on the game , since South Australia and Western Australia create almost 30 percent of Met@@ ar@@ Â Ig@@ A @-@ charging stations and generate higher profits as Met@@ ar@@ Â Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious and Ig@@ A retailer holds much more market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 per cent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di is cut off around five percent of the food market in these two states and will take away all existing players , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to the report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Ig@@ A @-@ retailer 360 million revenue per year and Met@@ cash 250 million can be lost by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pre@@ diction is based on that Al@@ di opened 25 branch offices in SA and 30 in WA and will win a turnover of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in the food and food store , and with the amounts of met@@ a @-@ high fixed @-@ cost base , Met@@ cash could cost roughly 13 million dollars before interest and taxes , said Mr K@@ ier@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly at Al@@ di and Col@@ it , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan was found that Ig@@ A @-@ entr@@ ap@@ ti@@ sts are the most faithful ones . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ als &apos;s turnover in the food and food business rose by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 to 4.@@ 1 percent in 2017 and 2.2 percent in 2016 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading Fon@@ ds@@ manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , at a business eat in Melbourne , that Met@@ cash are likely to disappear within a decade . &quot;
met@@ cash refused to react publicly on the comments by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is understood that a member of a member of Met@@ at@@ cash had been contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; STA@@ As Market share has declined from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and revenues from Met@@ ar@@ hs food and food stores , which is about 43 percent , has been sales in sales and margins in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the wholesale distributor did however , and inv@@ ests more than 150 million to produce sales prices with col@@ ates and vo@@ wels for hundreds of products every week , and Ig@@ A retailers in order to improve their shops through fast growing fresh foods and to deliver a better choice of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a &apos;s main business manager Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adap@@ tations and shop @-@ re@@ development programmes will grow to El@@ an and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return to profitability for the first time in four years . &quot;
Than@@ asi co@@ coon ) is supported by the president of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi co@@ kin@@ da deserves more praise than criticism for his behaviour .
Than@@ asi co@@ coon ) was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves a view of the president of the Australian tennis club Steve He@@ aly as praise for his own behaviour .
&quot; Kok@@ o akis , the younger of talented Du@@ os , which is always referred to as &quot; special K@@ s , &quot; got by in@@ famous engagement of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ RIN@@ KA with the Montreal Masters in the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualifying game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ da and his opponent Ry@@ an Harrison to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , taking Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ RIN@@ KA would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he was a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f was cancelled a potential US Open @-@ Open @-@ victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , was co@@ oper@@ atively defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , in competition with Sam Gr@@ oth around the second place in a single one behind Bernard Tom@@ ics in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing that I was rather hei@@ ghtened , is the fact that after my opinion Than@@ asi has been drawn a little into the dispute &quot; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a but@@ cher as he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a but@@ cher through your self , and I know Than@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the pretty pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserved a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around you , he has a great family around you , and I think he was treated a little too . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never played a problem with the other players he is well trained , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged on his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important pre @-@ selection , which begins on Friday and describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but it gives the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first we wish that the team is fully focused on competition and not all the controllers around &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was very quick to have made the climb , which people felt like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray . he asc@@ ends into the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes , but we try to give him the consequences of his action . some time out of the ram@@ p where he can only think about it , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , it closes the border , holding refugees back &quot;
Hungary declares the state of emergency and took the border line with Serbia on Tuesday and all held fast to try to head illegal in the country . everything related to the goal of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed at the border when hundreds of migrants re@@ acted to a kidney and Serbian government with rebellion .
&quot; the people who had fled from violence , were camp@@ ed for an unknown period in a ro@@ am on the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built up tents and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations have risen .
&quot; as a police helicopter about them moved , the migrants &quot; re@@ ed the borders &quot; &quot; and cried out insul@@ ts to Hungarian nuclear police forces . &quot;
some reported from protest food and water back .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign ministers stated that migrants would be &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; &quot; that migrants would be returning from Hungary , whilst more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) will want to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral of col@@ lateral .
&quot; during the coming days talks with Brussels and other countries will take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence at the Hungarian @-@ Ser@@ b border came one day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ bloc with a deb@@ ated meeting in Brussels to make no common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who were in over@@ head Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would conclude that the EU states would receive more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
but Hungary didn &apos;t put his hopes for an Australian action from Brussels or from its neighbours .
&quot; the emergency , on Tuesday , there was more authority in two southern regions to cope with the crisis , so that they could un@@ block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire , along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , after putting a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even Pen@@ al ins@@ ists were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire @-@ fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many military refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban had ins@@ isted that most incoming economic migrants are seeking a better life and not war @-@ refugees who have a right to protection - a view that stands strongly in contradiction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws passed around midnight in Hungary , make the crossing the border or damaging the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall Za@@ us who built the government alongside the southern border to Serbia , into a crime . these laws also set higher sti@@ ckers for sentenced to human trafficking . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation that arose from the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ person in Zol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern City of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .

election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton prot@@ ru@@ sion before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination on national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ ander will win their opposite to the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has now supported the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent earlier ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is not responsible for the Presidential Administration , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters of the elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion stands , which candidates will support them . &quot;
but Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters are more ste@@ ad@@ ful in their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had achieved some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a great advantage in women and Gem@@ mo@@ cks , but this le@@ aps have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has significantly reduced , and S@@ anders is only back to 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton @-@ Adv@@ ent of democratic voters under 50 years of age have fle@@ dged themselves , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage with the older voters . &quot;
last month Clinton was confronted with two @-@ point lead by the Liber@@ als but S@@ anders has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group now .
about half of the democratic voters of the national elections were saying that they would be united by enthusiasm when nominated by the party .
one quarter would support them with several reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they have the nom@@ inee as a candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ i@@ &apos;s current supporters are especially excited about her .
the views are stronger with those who currently not support the Clinton - only about one quarter would support it enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; during 48 percent of the democratic voters of the elections say , they Clinton can support enthusiasm with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters see this about their top @-@ American Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ t &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to have the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that there is time a woman president is ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; consent to the handling of problems and voters are also quoted . &quot;
&quot; as the Vice President re@@ jects a potential for the presidential office in the race , 57 percent of the democratic voters of the elections would see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters are asked for elections , who would be the second choice for the party is bi@@ den on the top . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ tons tra@@ ilers , more than half that Bi@@ den were their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; decide not for the Nom@@ inations of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton lead stepped off S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in competition to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with best opportunities to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 per cent over the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far the second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; dial &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , with the question of what is more important to a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these voters for the elections is in@@ ad@@ missible as unacceptable . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Democratic candidate or potential candidates will yield good results in some key characteristics with the voters of the pre @-@ election of their party . &quot;
&quot; ambig@@ u@@ ities are Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den cuts the three candidates best from honesty , while Clin@@ i@@ &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say about S@@ ander ( 15 % ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of it . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters of the elections are generally seen Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ olog@@ ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters do not have a view of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; there may be questions about Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the period of office as foreign ministries , the most Democratic voters of the elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that their opinions will not be influenced in total . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public overall .
half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation while only about one third is satisfied .
&quot; public opinion has been in March , shortly after the problem came to light , we split . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the E @-@ Mail controversy had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still worse . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their opinions from Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trustworthy by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy , this is still a problem for them under non @-@ recurring voters in total : 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the Elec@@ torate @-@ national nationwide participated too not be honest and not trustworthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump have however good notes at leadership .
&quot; from the six tested candidates proposed Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best with honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards us rather than honestly , but as at Car@@ son many do not have a view of him . &quot;
the fault rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son is moving close to Donald Tr@@ ump in country .
Ben Car@@ son is located at the latest pol@@ l of C@@ BS News / New York Times closely behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; the two candidates have now lap@@ sed half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others fall dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters sustain@@ ably support tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted before Fox News debate last month , by 27 % in the survey from Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son ch@@ oss over 6 % in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son arrives well in demographic groups and r@@ ump in Republi@@ can voters with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , except for C@@ arly Fior@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Governor John Ka@@ himself , is struck with Kno@@ cons@@ into Governor Scott Walker , who is at the lowest rate , from 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
former Florida @-@ Governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are on the third place with 6 % . &quot;
the bu@@ ff at the sampling of 3@@ 76 persons of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is plus or minus 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the newest CN@@ N / Or@@ c pol@@ l , published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the pol@@ ls - he arrived at 19 % support at the re@@ public@@ ans , behind the p@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed tr@@ ump clear before Car@@ son .
&quot; taking a look at one of the last week &apos;s rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump took some side @-@ to for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son apologi@@ ze for it to question m@@ umps in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump on last Saturday while one of the campaigns @-@ show in Iowa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean Sea is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , for bath@@ ers there is already a trip to the Mediterranean sea in order to keep warm water . &quot;
a bath in North or Baltic sea may be a rather short pleasure for a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; there is no more sea to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees the water in the north and Baltic Sea took place during this week , shares the German we@@ ather@@ ing ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;

&quot; in the Adriatic it is in the peak 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt is coming to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood stra@@ ined with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; almost two years after a student during a single @-@ kan@@ ous ritual is filed as a student connection in Po@@ kon@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , , M@@ ord@@ an@@ complain will be filed against five people . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI @-@ P@@ SI Brotherhood interven@@ ed in the hospital in September 2013 and hesit@@ ated his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death divided the police . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with their eyes with a 30 pounds back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field on a target . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compl@@ ained about headaches , then it fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i Delta P@@ SI Brotherhood does not stop the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and waited for an hour before they brought him into a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to get his symptoms and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood , to obtain advice , Poly@@ Re@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at that point the members , utensils began to hide and placed the good of the Brotherhood of fundamentally over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Chi@@ efs ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his wounds . &quot;
after a aut@@ op@@ ic report Den@@ g repeatedly became attached with bl@@ unter strength injury to head , trunk and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the Shi@@ kan@@ en of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies since 1970 each year to the Shi@@ kan@@ en , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer of the D@@ eng@@ a Family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and its members must be held to account , and that step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third row for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indicted for religious attacks and formation of a criminal union . &quot;
&quot; we not only want to be responsible for the individuals involved , but if there is an organization , which - officially or un@@ officially , we will also hold this to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national frat@@ ernity has vo@@ ke their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; a financial increase comes , and the house will fall into the rear where ren@@ ding for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
we know that .
&quot; what we don &apos;t know is how long it all take , and how long it will stop . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy is only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came up within just 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ siveness of the Federal Reserve when lifting the interest rates is often , if not always , a factor on how the economy and the financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; thus , representatives of the U.S. central bank have so strong stressed that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather down the time period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could notice however that the whole excitement because of a cement supply may be exagger@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the first raise in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted as a signal to the end of the era of &quot; cheap money &quot; , &quot; said Julian jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a Communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest to normal heights , but still at too low level in order to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical market based point of view how some areas of the economy could respond :
&quot; as seen in the market last month , the reduction of interest inser@@ tions can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the increase has been taken , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that wealth yields aged 12 to 24 months after their first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche @-@ Bank analysts in a newer study to what is happening after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market is mostly mentioned in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to cement , fairly flat in the past six cycles , by 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chef plant str@@ ate@@ ge in Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s published . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will occur later in the pregnancy @-@ cycle and returns the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but inser@@ tions they often promote .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is facing some conditions that were not there before and could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; the gross Dom@@ estic Product is in the proximity of its lowest score at a lobby increase , will be the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 r@@ inser@@ ts since 1950 was only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was at 3.@@ 6 percent , a few expect this , and expect the third quarter to Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions during such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question &quot; &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time &quot; , &quot; the Deutsche Bank said . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year to a set @-@ up raise the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC might make an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading gives just an account of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study all the t@@ apping cycles from 1950 to date have taken place in a super @-@ cycle that takes place in a super @-@ cycle and put before the recovery very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the fixed revenues was also volati@@ le , since the market is taking a ring , and the pattern is rather similar to the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect of bonds faster than with shares when they change their strategic course . &quot;
bonds appear to change the direction as soon as the first raise / lowering is carried out in the cycle .
at the end of the height @-@ cycle the bond @-@ pick@@ les exp@@ elled immediately ; the Deutsche Bank said .
the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in the interest rates will bring that ren@@ ders move closer to the curve between lengthy and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; non @-@ Sax@@ on bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ zer in Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , says Jones that markets have already adjusted to F@@ ed @-@ Strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some signs that the market has adapted to the prospect of more stringent monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings of income is fl@@ atter , credit @-@ ups have grown up and the volati@@ lity has increased - all the characteristics of the market if the F@@ ed sharp@@ ens their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and all over the world , businesses that benefit the larger part of their business operations in the United States , if interest rates increase and local produce will become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational corporations with high debts will be worse , since an increasing $ increases its products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debts . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive , three months after initial inser@@ tion raise extremely positive , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet have exceeded targets after each of the accounts recei@@ pts in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 at an average of 5 percent@@ ages . &quot;
company with high capital @-@ ren@@ ders as well as low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counterparts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt is a big problem .
companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will most lose but Gold@@ man said .
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also be able to profit by the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; Spar@@ er could see profits through higher yields , even if experts are of different opinion how quickly that will take place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM 2014 member of the member Andrew B@@ ingham
&quot; conservative member of the Parliament critici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; &quot; con@@ tainment &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliament member and raises new pressure on the transm@@ itter , demonstrating that he does anything that does not do the private ones . &quot;
&quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also told the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ender is stupid &quot; and increasingly can no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM . &quot;
he also took off at the BBC Music Awards which last December started .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seems to be The Br@@ its just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneously @-@ called examples which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director showed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 is lying 3 far from its commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn so differently about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music playing really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and to give Radio 3 , to find new music and to put new works in order , I also consider it important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 controller Alan Dav@@ ey who had been working harder to engage the audience than was doing so in the past , because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; but radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee on the selection of culture , media and sport under fire for making the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;

Internet turnover increased in August at the slo@@ west and black Friday can be responsible for this
seven percent increase in online sales in the first three months of 2015 .
last month has been the lowest result since the beginning of the records in 2000 .
online sales increased three years ago by using phones to buy
experts believe that Black Friday has slo@@ wed down the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled from , and many of the major shopping streets of Britain have turned into gh@@ ost towns . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are now signs that st@@ agn@@ ant online sales , after new numbers showed only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; overall spending on August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared to the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates of previous years and go back to 2000 , this time has always been developed , &quot; said Mr Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ T sales complex . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the online sales increased three years ago , as a buyer , to run with their mobile phones purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now the one comm@@ utes itself , and we may possibly experience that growth will dimin@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; black @-@ Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is cited as a reason for subsequent revenues . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases from this event , taking place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers seeking their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some dealers @-@ sites cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that black Friday , in which the buyer clas@@ hed for bar@@ gain , buyers may stop shopping . &quot;
a study by the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium was a major study of the British Ret@@ ail Con@@ sortium that a total of 5 £ spending was spent more than 1 £ online .
&quot; on some products such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and wash@@ ers , more than one third of the purchases are now available via web @-@ shops . &quot;
at the same time more than one quarter of the people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the mo@@ ki@@ ons in the inner cities .

she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that carry more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we must move this stronger towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our clients consist of 80 percent of women &apos;s choices on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of just five women at the head of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also been instruc@@ ted her top team to reflect equal numbers of men and women in management positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ fis@@ her is nearly the only company that took over 50 percent of the team with women , including management and financial management . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ fis@@ her re@@ formed a decline during the half @-@ year profit and the upheav@@ als after the group was responsible for the closing of the stores .
&quot; king King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , has opened 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries by A@@ I / DO@@ B due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity before judgment
at the Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday two officers of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ provider A@@ I / DO@@ B must be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and non @-@ education .
the def@@ endants were not guilty .
one of them was also charged for abuse of abuse .
from this accus@@ ation he was acqu@@ itted in May legally and exec@@ utable .
the current process was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the commander @-@ owned subsidiary Robert Ri@@ ffel , the def@@ endants refra@@ ined out in the preliminary examination that the endants were disp@@ osed in the years 2006 to 2011 funds from the club @-@ accounts that they disp@@ ose in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage was concerned with approximately 400@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports fields are also charged for financial proceedings .
&quot; this fact exp@@ ired the President of the Sho@@ e @-@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ chter@@ le Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the pro@@ clamation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence presented that there was no major asset to the association at any point in time . &quot;
&quot; the sports fields would have had to pay compensation damage and the sports club , for which they had spent a lot of time and money , carried out from the debts in 2001 - the Pas@@ va contributed around 600@@ ,000 ch@@ illing ( approx . 34@@ ,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : do we continue to lead the club to or block up ? , &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the bro@@ o@@ work of the financial center . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and other co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have put money out , our life insurance funds have been laid down by the bank , &quot; he said in the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there will only be no debts . &quot;
Fu@@ ther@@ ers be - in proportionate financial - success the payment of the compensation damage had been decided by the end of 1991 .
&quot; for this reason , one part of the allowance damage was only years later , namely from 2003 when a plus in the account was paid off . &quot;
&quot; therefore , even Package - and not detailed amounts of details , the former Ob@@ mann explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and branch books managed the two def@@ endants in common , said the second accused . &quot;
why the pay@@ outs of the association were not disclosed in detail would be asked the judge .
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of finance , just as the forgiveness of debt has been the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in 2011 against the one full @-@ term investig@@ ators began , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euro was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were pro@@ aches , but the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants , and was not known according to the statement contained by the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted the judge &quot;
&quot; after that , the asked for a long time did not answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , He believed that this was the best for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the pro@@ secutor made the public pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ accused would have been informed , far the function@@ ary was concerned . &quot;
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claims of damage . &quot;
why contam@@ in@@ dem@@ nity ? , wanted to know judge and pro@@ secutor . &quot;
&quot; the first accused did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never been any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; You are all from the hook . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; , &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary has said the functional , he has never referred a c@@ ents , but counting on only o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; when he had di@@ eting the association 1,000 euros per month , but the actual expense was much higher , &quot; he added . &quot;
the def@@ endants were not able to present precise documents for the early years .
&quot; these were after a trial , in which everything had been judged correctly , no longer kept , they explained . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter @-@ allowance had also made the second def@@ endant .
&quot; all def@@ ences are made in cash , in addition to having to drive from his residence international market to the bank to Blei@@ burg , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings were continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .

behind it a police line had formed and behind the poli@@ c@@ emen stood a light head@@ light .
40 to 50 refugees began to throw down stones , blocks and plastic bottles according to their officials . &quot;
the officials initially carry uninterrupted pepper spray .
then the police used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a .
much of the lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ a was weak@@ ened towards the refugees .

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US staff is on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision whether for the first time since nearly a decade the interest rates are raised . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by 80 econom@@ ists , which were asked by Re@@ uters , found out that a little more than half , which still last week the opinion was that the F@@ ed will do anything longer and will keep the interest rates at the current status of 0 - 0.@@ 25 per cent . &quot;
it &apos;s a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ UL@@ L .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a major central bank would potentially end the zero @-@ branch and launch a process of norm@@ alization of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ sti@@ bi@@ des , chief workers at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is at a relatively good performance level , tri@@ llion dollars will be added to the balance sheet and generate just a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less raw view of global conditions . &quot;
&quot; she has warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision is to be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .
frightened to the Delta State University left apologi@@ zing for it
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later died his colleague and killed he wrote Sh@@ annon , a note to say that he could &quot; &quot; do &quot; &quot; with his first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could do it un@@ happen &quot; , &quot; announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Mississippi , said that he &apos;s professor for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , the emergency number against 10 : 00 am Monday morning calling &quot;
&quot; and said , he shot up someone and killed someone . &quot;
he &apos;s member of the emergency centre that police officers must send poli@@ c@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m talking my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he mentioned also that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; in the house is , but which will be &quot; &quot; no one &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
he was not an explanation of his shots .
&quot; when the police stepped onto the scene they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , the said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted it , I could be rever@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; I loved Amy , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note he drove 300 miles to Delta State University where he killed E@@ ane Schmidt , a professor of history , killed , before leaving his own life on Monday night when gendar@@ mer@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; he said William La@@ For@@ ge &apos;s universal president William La@@ For@@ ge , he ignor@@ se nothing of a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , which he supposedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss also had a relationship , said authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; Trinity relationship . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was named by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who testi@@ fied that she was about seven years ago as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but were friends . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &apos;s absolutely best friends .
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to statement from L@@ ins@@ day K@@ now@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend from Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , had been with him for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said he &apos;s aff@@ licted on Monday at a certain time on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; he &apos;s not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; as poli@@ c@@ emen climbed him on the highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he ran his car to the side , fled into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
he &apos;s Eve in the spring of 2015 from the Delta State University to buy a PH@@ D at the University &apos;s website .

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
Lufthansa is planning a large concert hall .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
150 of the world &apos;s workforce of around 1000 managers will cost the workplace restructuring around the world .
with the pilot plant there is also the new negotiation .
the Lufthansa builds its corporate structure to increase and evalu@@ ates the current Euro@@ wings on the schedule .
&quot; the aim of real@@ ignment is a result of roughly 500 million euros a year of cost and redemption , and distributed the airline on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , at Lufthansa , there will be no board of charge for the passenger in the future . &quot;
the Bil@@ lig@@ in@@ y Euro@@ wings sol@@ le are designed to be as independent as possible .
in the board team around chief car@@ sten Spo@@ hr will be responsible in the future Karl Ulrich Sh@@ adt for Euro@@ wings .
&quot; with the new position , Spo@@ hr underlines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ Jet at the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 thousand employees has been complex . &quot;

&quot; cock@@ pit wants to come into a year with a predicted &quot; &quot; cock@@ pit &quot; &quot; in one year as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the trade union and the Air@@ line last months led to a variety of strikes .
&quot; this is part of the &quot; &quot; Transi@@ tional concept &quot; &quot; of the pilots established next to the transitional provision of the pilots . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United may not play Mon@@ g@@ ang for double frac@@ ture
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w , at the Champions League of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven a double frac@@ ture of his right thing . &quot;
&quot; while this is able to include the left outside defence , and exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al won &apos;t give hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
&quot; the injury was caused by a rel@@ ent@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w broke into the PS@@ V region . &quot;
he was treated nine minutes in the playing field and needed oxygen before he was brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said , &quot; &quot; he has doubled B@@ einf@@ ra@@ ing and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will move on tomorrow or maybe a day later and then surgery in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it is very difficult and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then it takes six months and he will not play in the group stage . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
&quot; Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy , to escape a Red card and the suspension of an ellip@@ se . &quot;
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , has not pen@@ alized the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian refer@@ ee had been mistaken .
&quot; as a result , you can judge for yourself if I tell you that an i@@ f@@ meter and a red card was required . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ w account : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I get , my path to recovery starts now , I will return more strongly . &quot;
here to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at the PS@@ V
England defen@@ ders has an added incentive to recover with the European Championship in France until the next of June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad violation . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury all are very sad about that .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt one opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg demo@@ lition when Mexico was playing against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the World Cup 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , that is not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in another direction , so it looked out as if he had touched him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; talking to S@@ BS@@ 6 said Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very ill with it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also taken to the hospital - after a fishing game of Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron The Lor@@ ax better known ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
&quot; unless , then you are David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; asked as he was asked by a provider of child care systems , his favorite child book , decided to grant the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , which was published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , he writes in a message on the site of the company &apos;s Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to have an image or message that we have so far missed . &quot;
&quot; all nice and well , except that the next paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the plot of the book , instead , returns a table version of the movie version of 2012 , added the new characters and details added to the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; amid the w@@ alled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , hopes that a boy named Ted , met the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to see the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y who died in 1991 . a love interest was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss bo@@ el lau@@ ted and the 1991 died , however completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not yet suspect enough : the text presented by Cameron presented , partly like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film , which is presented on the website of the Lor@@ ax film , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , hopes a boy named Ted , to gain the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to win the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; though he adm@@ its to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron &apos;s action of the book is so little familiar . here , an un@@ named boy , like the local environment by the h@@ itting , o@@ dd@@ ling tor@@ ches , carved in the name of trees , &quot; is desol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was sent to a hel@@ per who has read The Lor@@ ax not 20 times in a row for a child . &quot;
a down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably come from the Camer@@ ons &apos;s office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the lyrics of Mr Cameron were delivered , but there was no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team but it is still hard
&quot; to encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you chose the cad@@ res , the England for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not at my card . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward .
&quot; A@@ ver@@ air C@@ look site is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the batt@@ ing list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali is developed as a spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
in this news : Adam Ly@@ th separ@@ ates from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision , Adam Ly@@ th &apos;s decision , is of course for me as the head @-@ coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyze . &quot;
&quot; with his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that crime players are targeted on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question for Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination - and I told this - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; a long time ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully turns out further gaps for Yor@@ k@@ shire , it &apos;s another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and he does not surprise me : he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; the question of how much time a test stroke will get , to put its mark is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine got . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance for home and backward .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that can be lifted up was that England initially entered Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean , when Ly@@ th was in peak form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales come in , and he is a stroke that I appreciate very much . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ tic player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire , early in this season , when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge Square , which greatly met . &quot;
&quot; he must get at least the same chances as before him , but it depends of course on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of letting Mo@@ een next to Cook suggest what a Extra spin @-@ Bow@@ ler would be delivered , and four Qui@@ cks would get , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ sk@@ id of cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps has not completed his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but it &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests in the first drop before he performed 2001 as Open@@ er .
he has managed a three hundred and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes in the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him , he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it is a Pun@@ t , but there is no big number of recommendation spinning in their hands , and the coaches have chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made a few smart additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Com@@ awar@@ ding , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as consultants for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest scores of the game that will bring a wealth of experience , as it has played amongst all the conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is planned for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful commitment into the setup .
&quot; I &apos;ve always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as coach , and as Mah@@ ela he gained insights on which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices in the locker room can bring fresh air even if the news is in line with the said . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ am , Ben St@@ okes , is not used at the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break with Australia and I think I didn &apos;t have a problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but co@@ aches and team controllers do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must think that as with the players will depend on their jobs on the results .
such decisions are not made easy heart .
the Bre@@ xit ( Bre@@ xit = exit of Britain from the EU ) could gain access to Zul@@ u if the economy by 2017
&quot; David Camer@@ ons un@@ founded this strategy to hold the UK in the EU will get deeper into trouble with each day , even without the election of the genial Jer@@ emy &quot; Is It Yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Leader of Labour or TU@@ C , which is fi@@ erc@@ ely har@@ med for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;

&quot; in Brighton , the TU@@ C outlines the annual meeting that it may not like it if they threaten to protect social protection . &quot;
we could also call Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; prime minister and finance ministers climb on summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of himself from a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they will be allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wants to be looking for an outside Britain within the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and shows that more and more short @-@ sighted minister and officials come up to the point where they no matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cautious Chancellor Angela Merkel is a ally , but she has been in power for 10 years now and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look at his re@@ election or its creation in 2017 .
it is also a bl@@ ending force .
&quot; Poland soon has a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to imagine that she will s@@ nat@@ ch up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , perhaps some such ministers even do not see some helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P @-@ style , during the UK &apos;s conference campaign to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my boyfriend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won nothing of its value from ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street could be at their cost and which EU scep@@ tics to the oligarchy of the press @-@ bar@@ one , as she had been inspired by Tony Ben@@ n &apos;s guide in 1975 but did not , that supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ un@@ ists who gave himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ ade ban@@ anas in Brussels &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his back@@ war@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who had his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this belongs the med@@ ley of tax @-@ dre@@ aming sho@@ cks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack foreigners and the pseudo @-@ non @-@ foreigners who most of our major newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Blair is similar about her , but was notes that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one gets better ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of becoming a lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band had more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Blair itself , as himself led to the legisl@@ ator of the EU , presented by French and Dutch voters in 2005 that opened it a door door . &quot;
the press has never missed him that .
but the nice Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me back to Westminster on Monday - I told him that he had no time for me to waste - seems to be in peri@@ l N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks Boy@@ cott Mur@@ doch strategy of 80 @-@ s years to repeat a mistake at that time and today .
&quot; it may take last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s official position on Europe is - I want it to be friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a reform@@ ist EU .
&quot; now , most people are outside U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ender tendency and the wil@@ ler of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can everybody to say about any one . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; One Ben@@ n , but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week was , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ en &apos;s appointment of provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as a shadow advisor is a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , when his old father stro@@ ve on to lay his loyal towards his Labour &apos;s cabinet , without going too far and to lose his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was more attractive .
&quot; but to fight in order to remain &quot; in all circumstances - Ben@@ ns an expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told its collaborators and members according to all reports on their ple@@ th@@ at on Monday night . &quot;
which also wants to convey the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that he even touched me - news discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all things in the ma@@ el@@ strom of social media ; a breeding site of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal .
it &apos;s right that Cameron does not give free tickets for Europe who per@@ mitting him to maintain Lab@@ our@@ y support in the speech campaign for a natur@@ al@@ ness just like Mc@@ Don@@ nell said .
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks that way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns basic ambig@@ u@@ ities , in line with their Ben@@ n@@ ite Bel@@ ag@@ rap@@ port , its anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ issu@@ s of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities , Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign for ex@@ iting - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find in all a sense of their superi@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin are wast@@ ing political capital - they also have mis@@ trust@@ ful elec@@ torate - to make concessions to the British when all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US has already been dis@@ disappointed by the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government , which at the beginning of Monday , when the British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum has been called . &quot;
experts and report of Public Health England via e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; asser@@ tions of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking was created from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , they said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that they were g@@ rie@@ ve by the Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report about e @-@ cigarettes used in their report .
p@@ he published the &quot; key@@ note report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and transferred to the connections between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et recent month , the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and have asked whether the claims &quot; put on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is to be based on protecting the effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that the claim of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; the present best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of references and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ domain analysis decision ( Multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to guide their opinions about the damage of various nicotine @-@ containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of this meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose director had previously received by British American Tob@@ acco Directors ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to public health in a sustainability report and they said .
&quot; one of the 12 participants in the meeting declared to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes producer , but not financing that he will have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not provided , but these include several well @-@ known e @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide a range of industries in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also the tobacco be@@ headed was taken from p@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; sec@@ t@@ ingly &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products by most criteria , &quot; described Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; said Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of p@@ he that &quot; &quot; there are no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes were used as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he said that the claims of BM@@ J had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all proo@@ fs suggest that health risks of e @-@ cigarettes are low compared to that , but we continue to have long @-@ term effects to study . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what is evidence of evidence and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0.000 people annually die from a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; clear indications of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC has to abandon the East@@ em@@ ders , says former head of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chair of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop building programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would put their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio station should only be used to make the kind of programs that cannot be sent by other UK channels .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for calling on public legal programmes , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial Zeit@@ fenster against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and stations such as BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General , Tony Hall , Tony Hall , the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried to get in touch with his BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs put in order or sends those messages also clearly presented by non @-@ winning ri@@ vals , &quot; &quot; said Johnson to the commander @-@ communications committee in the context of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , what I consider medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least keep his production on programs that others do not make or put in order . &quot;
they send The Voice in a prime time window because they want to achieve a wide range of possible support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous , it &apos;s natural nonsense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , admittedly both of their own productions . &quot;
frank@@ ly speaking other channels would give their right arm for this .
I am trying to see how this is publicly available .
I don &apos;t believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business builder for series , who ran to channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC remains to blame for reviews &quot; because of the ambitions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular shows of the BBC give that again what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can quite rightly judge their tasks , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue if they have created all these above mentioned programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them into a window @-@ window where no one they ever wanted to see .
&quot; for the broad@@ casting , Johnson said the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions of which the best value can be received . &quot;
&quot; of course , you think all , that one gets a great value for 150 £ a year for 150 £ a year , but for those who &apos;s for the 150 £ a lot of money , I wonder if that &apos;s true because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 @-@ Chief David El@@ stein , who also said on Tuesday before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check their Rei@@ th@@ ian Mission , to form and maintain . &quot;
he said just little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said it was 1 % of their TV production and 0.@@ 1 % on the radio - and they should take part in public @-@ law broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada . for example take this change in &apos; inform and talking .
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of TV can be shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers , to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ An &apos; can control brain cells by si@@ fying waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ den change the direction at the moment in which they will be radi@@ ated with sound impul@@ ses .
scientists have bred wor@@ ms with genetically modified nerve systems that can be controlled by ou@@ tre@@ ach of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny ne@@ at@@ ins change the direction in the moment they have with sound impul@@ sive , which have too high frequencies on human hearing , in order to be radi@@ ated . &quot;
the impulses are working through the switching of mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells that are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that are responding to ultras@@ ound waves .
more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new procedure , called Son@@ o@@ An , in which ultras@@ ound can be used to enable a number of brain , cardi@@ ac and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Hal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain rubber . &quot;
&quot; far@@ es usually do not react on ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani noted that they did it when they were surrounded by a fluid of micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , found it out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the strengthened ultras@@ ound waves act on the structures that can be called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion , and can be found in the membran@@ es of some of the spice cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves , the opening of these I@@ on@@ gs channels and activate the cells in which they are assigned to , so a report Nature Communications . &quot;
to create an ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled Nem@@ at@@ m genetically modified Hal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ics carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels .
&quot; when using ultr@@ asonic onto the changed creatures , the bells are reinforced by the micro@@ blo@@ kes and transmitted to the wor@@ ms , where they turn the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; the process has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ Get , a groundbreaking tool that allows scientists to em@@ power neur@@ ons with impulses of light and turn off . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ An could have some advantages compared to this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent from an optical fiber at the desired place in the brain , low mode of ultras@@ ound @-@ waves can happen enormously and so can be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the introduced human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , &quot; he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago I moved as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old in a student dormit@@ ory , still in belief in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who have been angry - and to the numerous , slow complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the pull in student dormit@@ ories varies from mild pull @-@ up to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to we@@ et : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you can honestly love Mar@@ m@@ ite , because in Ernst , guys , there is just a spring extract Ha@@ haha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you to figure out people which you like as opposed to those you would not speak , even if your lashes would be burned in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers . &quot;
let people take .
&quot; the rooms of people often transform themselves into beverages , film @-@ night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and under@@ wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
in @-@ field : do not think to join the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted treatment is considered to be a rough handling at the university .
&quot; her room should be a refuge for her , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ space @-@ B@@ um@@ mel culture , which can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I will know that our friendship continues , but you must go away so that I have used the energy I have used for inter@@ acting with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a com@@ it@@ one of convi@@ vi@@ ality is exhausted , and send him an SMS instead of knock . &quot;
apro@@ pos anchor : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ 0s , welcome in the neighborhood , I have something to crack . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
&quot; homemade treats , is a good way to make friend@@ ships . &quot;
your mates feel oblig@@ ated to maintain yourself and will end up perhaps your face with a tasty surprise .
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent bakery . &quot;
&quot; badly mixed l@@ umps from flour , sugar and gre@@ ase lead to putting people asleep when you drop . &quot;
ste@@ al foods is a common crime living in student residence .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea also ? &quot;
check the with the dairy owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they bo@@ il in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , is the annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a flush with her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make noise that people from sleep or work dimin@@ ished .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ b belong to the people who sit in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hallway asked her neighbors , if there really matters a thing , Drum &amp; bass put something qui@@ eter , because it was 3 o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to this with even more clever music .
&quot; when she finally started listening to 5 p.m. , she kindly let her neighbors still sleep two hours before she pl@@ ain@@ ted her own music , shut her door and set up to her three @-@ hour trial . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would happen to move in the same dor@@ f@@ eller ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be so embarrassing for you to hold a room@@ mate for your future wives , turn again and then you will have to see each day and perhaps experience how she passes all common friends to herself ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own paths - but when a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partner , try at least to turn your sub@@ ver@@ b a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice that someone has its keys in his un@@ locked room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing @-@ a , as it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good trick is fun , but it only takes moments when it gets to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
re @-@ place through conce@@ aling a valuable and am@@ using lesson about safety - but neglect someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place their keys in a glass of water you then put in the freezer - but push their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; terr@@ aced houses for refugees , single @-@ ear@@ ners , t@@ ley @-@ ear@@ ners &quot;

&quot; I am showing how to still get cheap and well built today , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the apartment market .
the entrepren@@ eur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly cheaper housing can be created : he builds up in a project terr@@ aced houses for refugees .
Mr. Gil@@ dner and many refugees will push for the apartment market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or sne@@ h@@ halls has no sustainability .
for men stay a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee flow , we also need enough living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row @-@ house needs the least place .
it facilitates the integration .
that is different when people get accommodated in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses that are just being built in the pilot project , consists of three units for each of four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , one bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can easily be changed according to their needs .
how much is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price of 160 square meters of living space per house amoun@@ ted to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
six months the building took time .
this is appropriate .
are building rules build up their plans ?
Guil@@ d : &quot; legally I have drawn my project correctly .
particularly complicated it is always the lo@@ oming Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ kin &apos;s special construction and the space @-@ space Reg@@ ulations .
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still hidden , which creates three apartments in a terr@@ aced house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is lacking in the place .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the inhabitants react to their town@@ house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ d@@ dner : there were what they threw me off , luxury builds for asylum seekers . &quot;
what is definitely not true .
but ti@@ ghten your competitive fight for payable flats ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : it is true that in the last five years we had a construction boom in Germany , but build new luxury apartments , which could hardly afford a more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need a living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother @-@ based mother or the well @-@ deserved . &quot;
I am showing how to still get cheap and well @-@ build today .
that is what it is about .

&quot; this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has done this due to the cas@@ ing of the updates un@@ probable . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you install a special tool , and then re @-@ install it as soon as the process is finished . &quot;
it &apos;s worth to ensure that your mobile phone is loaded during the update or is located near a charger that the battery is loaded .
&quot; if the charge is too low , Apple doesn &apos;t stop that the update will continue , since the telephone could be switched off halfway and this could result in a down@@ fall of the update . &quot;

the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from mountain to the city center .
&quot; more precisely , to the Count @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
there was recently opened a new branch office .
&quot; here , directly next to the shopping market , we immediately get seniors and advice information on issues such as nursing safety or the services of the nursing and nursing . &quot;
&quot; for years we have been firmly embedded with our patient care service , that often the nursing relatives are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; also , not rarely many services of the cash are not avail@@ ed because the complexity of the insur@@ ances are not yet understood , &quot; explained the new house@@ keeper of &quot; &quot; Jut@@ ta W@@ eig@@ and , &quot; responsible for Anton@@ isti@@ ft and Citizens , and for the out@@ patient &quot; &quot; Ama@@ deus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to discussions , the new Qu@@ arti@@ ers@@ office also offers health , health care and wellness . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken by boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore you can use additional facilities such as storm @-@ invention , memory training or any physi@@ otherapeu@@ tic treatment . &quot;
the offers of the retirement Centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , provision and rehabilitation . &quot;

&quot; witnesses are seeking the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ ins : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were walking from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police with his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was at the height of the B@@ FT @-@ gas station .
on the land of the gas station three people also stopped .
&quot; one of these men now crying out to the young , and cutting this one with your own face . &quot;
the victim suffered a lap@@ se and bleeding strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends aff@@ licted and acting to the bat , he let him first of his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the last young man was now brought home .
the perpetrators followed the group with a car up to the apartment and drove over several times there .
&quot; as one could no longer see the vehicle , the one went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
&quot; then , he was once again attacked by the r@@ ack@@ et and another male person . &quot;
under the aid of a stroke of stri@@ des you test on the face and the th@@ ig@@ h of the victim .

Dr. Frank Müller ar@@ ouses the field of Fel@@ low@@ ausen and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ rowing .
&quot; in addition , Sam@@ t@@ are collabor@@ ating Bernd Bor@@ mann , economics at Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
at many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand has luck : there Dr. Frank Müller on 1 October the practice of Fel@@ lows .
&quot; during the UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ub@@ ausen entered the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing on his successor during the next months . &quot;
&quot; according to a modification phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12 , until then he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 euros in the premises at the St.@@ Peter Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first glance , when the Fel@@ lowship of years ago Frank Müller and his wife met Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently taking into practice their professional pharmac@@ ist education and is also willing to get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ gre@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was , I simply called it . &quot;
married Müller liked the idea to pursue its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we would like to meet and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; as an benefit , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
and so one agreed that the Mü@@ llers bought the house with the practice .
they will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ time family @-@ owned artist Frank Müller also grew up , with its medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several medical offices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel . &quot;
&quot; currently he is active as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , he also became a leading specialist in Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is actively involved in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; as of 19 September , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ lowship has worked as a car@@ pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian , his spouse has specialised in the gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both inter@@ acts , want to settle down as a house@@ keeper . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the re@@ modeling the rooms will look more modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations as well as long @-@ term and pay@@ load @-@ EK@@ GS and need one speech room more .
&quot; in addition , the E@@ DP is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50@@ 000 euros , the Mü@@ llers are granted under a funding programme of the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice is continued on , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ all@@ encomp@@ assing Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients arrive to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter in the practice of Fel@@ low@@ ausen , in the North @-@ German Association it are approximately 500 . &quot;
there is another general practitioner in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ur@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
if no successor could have found it would have gone .
&quot; who visited the trav@@ eller @-@ session , by the way still looks in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power of the field . &quot;
&quot; with their par@@ ting departure at A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have been practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; &quot; recalls UR@@ SE@@ L Fel@@ ub@@ ausen @-@ melting . &quot;
a little sad@@ ness she felt after the long time already .
&quot; but we live further in Hohen@@ lo@@ or and many patients will certainly see many patients &quot; , &quot; says the Inter@@ nis@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; your man adds l@@ ach@@ ingly : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; hitherto I have always pushed myself from gardening , now this could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grandchildren and travels . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now , the border controls are also highly up@@ lifted at our border @-@ border , &quot; said Interior Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border should remain upright in parallel .
&quot; still it is clear that everyone who wants to put an asylum application , can do so . &quot;
the supply and safety of human subjects are our main focus .
&quot; clearly , however , that there is clear signals , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept lim@@ it@@ less migration flows , nor about the Austrian @-@ slo@@ ven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia
the Croatian government had previously provided that Slovenia wants to continue traveling to refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances also called cor@@ ridors for the refugees .
this is quite like this interior Minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ mer &apos;s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not .
&quot; cor@@ ridors &quot; is absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather to intensify the border of the border - especially to Hungary - intensify . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed in emphas@@ ising , Sloven@@ e wants to seal out its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill out his commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; concluded Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as Croatian government po@@ ets , the first refugees had already tried to travel to the border crossing of the border crossing the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in Eastern Croatian in order to escape the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could record it in the near math fields .
&quot; according to local media , since then , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , we have been meeting with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
also rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country will be reck@@ oned with around 4,000 refugees , said Minister of Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo participated in the Maced@@ onian @-@ Ser@@ b border , which so far had brought migrants to the Hungarian border in the direction of Croatia , presented Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade qu@@ ire however , that it is whether people are sm@@ iting certain routes : &quot; neither can we do this , nor do we want to do this &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , at least in the morning a first bus arrived with about 50 refugees in the Ser@@ b border city of Si@@ d , in the course of the day another bus would expect . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were travelling the whole night away from the border to the Maced@@ onian border on the road about 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary promised , so the police declared that we are going to drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; thus , it could now actually become a rather distant shift of the previous Balkan Route to Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a somewhat wider north @-@ west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s interior of O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible elimination of refugees in the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; he did not calling it , but he pointed out that Croatia was a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
you conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partner faced a good testimony to the country since then , which concerns the standards of border controls . &quot;
at the Hungarian border fence further 300 refugees continue to be stuck in the Hungarian border fence .
&quot; according to Bel@@ gra@@ der media , they would have spent the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border passes Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely locked . &quot;
&quot; if the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic tried to calm down the debates on the current issue in Hor@@ gos , when the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently take a very high amount of refugees .
&quot; they could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already started to travel to the Refu@@ ge@@ es region to which alternative routes are incorporated in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are still more than 20 years after the end of the Croatian civil war , not more spacious de@@ min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police were known that a team of de@@ mining operations was sent in the border region .

&quot; lively , pr@@ istine life with stunning autumn sun@@ shine and middle of four huge panels at each time with the title &quot; &quot; Be@@ fore I am dying ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ iz@@ ers &quot; &quot; has attracted attention with this action on its 20 year anniversary and can thoroughly confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it is about life , that is why we have walked with the action in the middle of the city and among men , &quot; says Jose@@ fine lam@@ mer . &quot;
&quot; the chief econom@@ ist of E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hosp@@ ice aid is available to the pas@@ sers @-@ by for questions and discussions , as well as volunteers . &quot;
&quot; while some a Pass@@ ant spontaneously acc@@ esses to the chal@@ k and set the sentence for &quot; my life , &quot; &quot; read &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; to stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not long &quot; , &quot; stay others briefly , read things like &quot; &quot; I am not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again , there are little discussions about the action on life , dealing with death . &quot;
also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on location .
&quot; only when I make clear to me that at some point the end of this world comes , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the Director of the di@@ ac@@ onal factory Mannheim , which is together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ ce@@ tic bearer of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ic Hosp@@ ice aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public action was good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; that not everyone wants to publicly express themselves on the boards , whether it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; the issue of death and dying is still frau@@ ght with Tab@@ us , so the experience of Jose@@ fine lam@@ mer , even though the Hosp@@ ice movement in recent years have contributed much to that of people . &quot;
a assessment made by the Angel@@ ika Go@@ al roid .
the death and funeral person is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
personal experiences are confronted with the topic and read them a lot of literature and decided to engage in the dying aid .
&quot; when the en@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ ice was sought by a call for volunteers , she immediately reported it and was in the company since it was founded in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is part of a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the subject concerned and relatives of private households , hospitals , nursing homes , and hosp@@ ice in hosp@@ ice . &quot;
all of them are carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ def@@ roid can work well with her job and experience and experience .
&quot; I see life from another warm , consider it precious and value the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of out@@ patient E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hosp@@ it@@ ches is free of charge and denomin@@ ation@@ ally .
&quot; the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and associations enable training , as well as further training and supervision of the mort@@ als and supervis@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; every two years are training courses for new employees . &quot;
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the protest@@ ant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further personal wishes can be noted on post@@ cards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed , Fin@@ anz outlook for 2016 &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ closing results for the last quarter and the Lie@@ fer @-@ giant gave his profit outlook on an entire year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his Bod@@ transfer service .
&quot; the company also said that she plans to join about 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to stop the 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell on 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. told to earn a profit between 10.@@ 40 and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in the next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts expected according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increase , which amount to 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4 and despite the higher rainf@@ all of the Bod@@ transfer of heavy and large packages , which are being collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said , however , that it will still expect the result from the previous year due to cost reduction , increased income and growth in the online trade . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company produces &quot; solid income &quot; if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for the holiday @-@ employment were announced one day later than that of the Riv@@ al U@@ PS , which is planning to stop 9@@ 0.000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex 6@@ 92 million served $ , 6 percent more than last year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at 2.@@ 42 $ per share , just below the 2,@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of Z@@ acks Investment Research officers . &quot;
sales rose by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion $ .
six of Z@@ acks interviewed analysts expected 12.@@ 23 billion $ .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international pri@@ mal transmission over the past few years that generated sales in his / her unit Express shipment to a st@@ agn@@ ant .
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for greater packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unity won greater revenue on account of higher prices , while the result declined because of higher labour costs in cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ ex stock exchanges for 3,@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0,@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they included 11 percent of the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated conference in the year , Federal Reserve Str@@ ate@@ gen will spend two days this week round a 27 @-@ foot @-@ pole ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to lift the benchmark for the first time in almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; mur@@ als over them at one end of the frozen , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat seed shows a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed @-@ President Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues will put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a double job of Congress : maxim@@ izing the US employment and prices here stable .
but since the big recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged it &apos;s a failed third mandate - financial stability .
&quot; this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision which is too tight in order to pre@@ dict it . it will be announced on Thursday to be ready to restart the U.S. economy , from the unprecedented incentive for close to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could be scar@@ ed to ampli@@ fy F@@ ed representatives to increase the volati@@ lity in the increase in interest rates for federal states - and unless it is only one fourth percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation is primarily the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the Mak@@ ing company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pretext , not increase the interest rate , is the increased insecurity around the global market enough justification , continuing to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed is doing on what to protect itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , which were recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets are however expecting a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance on an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline of the stock market , in case the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists lose the strike , by promising that further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score at 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or around 1,4 % on 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; this action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if they do it , they would have to go very far in their statement to re@@ assure the financial markets that they will not panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argued that a cement will calm the financial markets , because they would eliminate insecurity about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; one month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of the Mongo@@ lian conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ elles had said in spring and in early summer , despite the complaints of liber@@ als that would require more economic advance , an increase in the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs in August slo@@ wed down , improvement on the labour market was solid in this year . &quot;
&quot; unemployment rate rose to 5.@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the levels , which the F@@ ed as full employment looks . &quot;
pay@@ lines have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; despite the inflation continued under the annual goal of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason would be the temporary effect of much lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist of the Macro@@ economics . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets at the whole world were coming together at the end of the last month , after China had de@@ valued its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage fell to more than 16 % in May by more than 16 % , as investors had feared that a slo@@ wing of the Chinese economy would slow down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered in this month , whereas the Dow is now nearly 10 % below the p@@ ch of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ als affect the complex calculation , when you should raise interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy have not occurred during the past few weeks , they would put at this meeting the breeders , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he tells us that she will wait at least a month to better get a grip on the effects .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of uncertainty about what will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so they should not be involved in their decision making . &quot;
&quot; but in the end , the F@@ ed Monetary Agency of the World has become . &quot;
the central bank &apos;s influence was huge in recent years .
&quot; the mere note of the then leadership of Ben S. Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could provide their mon@@ e@@ ti@@ ary expansion &quot; , &quot; redeemed con@@ fu@@ sions around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives may not only super@@ v@@ ise the developments at other locations , but also with other central banks and experts to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for asset management of the company En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , re@@ marked this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a story of over@@ reactions to financial market movements that have apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , voting single member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which is committed to a set of inser@@ tion , established decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percent@@ ages in three sessions , &quot; despite limited recognis@@ able effects on growth in the US &quot; , &quot; said L@@ acker . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives made these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should put aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis like the market upheav@@ al 2008 in the first place , said Adam S. Poznań , former member of the Committee for the interest rate of the Bank of England . &quot;
the recent turbul@@ ence do not come into the proximity of this level . he said .
&quot; she certainly does not want to fall into the situation where she is afraid of a cement , because the markets are ex@@ iting , &quot; said Poznań , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until it is changed , I do not believe it should be hurry . &quot;
need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chinatown .
&quot; yes , Chinatown &quot;
the market / camp was established in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as the Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is in Chinatown and it is not the Thai town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a be@@ wil@@ dering number of fresh , frozen and dried snacks , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car @-@ section if you need electric oil .
&quot; the store is huge , and it takes over an hour , through the cor@@ ridors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping you are hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen area ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the terraces and has various transportation options .
what it gives : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialties and regional th@@ a@@ edic herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; meat the@@ ke is extensive , as does the la@@ the@@ ke - the staff behind the counter will clean@@ se the fish and fi@@ le@@ te it even on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive banking section . here you will find frozen Cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and Gal@@ gan@@ t , whole ducks , fish , bo@@ d@@ ging and G@@ alle , pigs , natural saus@@ ages , commercial saus@@ ages , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who buy here a : restaurant owners and cooks , as well as single families and individuals . &quot;
the broad hall@@ ways are suitable for shopping cars and for@@ k@@ lift trucks .
you can find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian beside the cas@@ hier .
where he is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chinatown and the inner city - a couple of blocks away from Philippe The original .
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the store is well attended , it is not hard to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
a warm welcome to prepare you is not without the engagement of innumerable volunteer hel@@ per .
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ da , there are a number of people who support un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ one is with body and soul teacher .
she is always keen to teach with her 74 L@@ acking .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er Street at the D@@ ill@@ inger street . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different classes than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric Society Rio Grande promotes nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
&quot; the Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS attempts to clarify the shocking way women on how important good nutrition is during the breastfeeding period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , who are painted with depic@@ tions of unhealthy foods . &quot;
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake in order to increase approximately 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , some new research results suggest that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation that mothers should carry . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet did actually affect the genes of their babies and protect them from the development of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an unhealthy diet of the child can have a negative impact on the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new amber industry
the municipal council of Bern@@ ried approved the building entry for the 2.3 million euro sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof is allowed to fl@@ atter for solar install@@ ation@@ .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ outs at the amber area come step by step : in the recent council meeting , the processed construction policy was cancelled without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the Board approved an application for a statutory &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings , a &quot; semi @-@ roof &quot; is supposed to be established with non @-@ co@@ ded First and Dach@@ stein . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof space for solar generators : &quot; &quot; therefore we get a wonderfully large Sü@@ dd@@ ach together , &quot; &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; for &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; in turn came for the a@@ version that is for energy reasons - different than in the development plan , to lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is thus significantly reduced .
&quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan on the umbrella is not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the magnitude of the land@@ der@@ ate is usually rather restric@@ tive in freedom of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , at the gym , this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the athle@@ te structure at the sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and of S@@ V amber .
&quot; at the cost , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from the school and grass@@ roots sports .
&quot; in the next process stage , the building application for the 18 x 36 metres wide hall is now being put to the reservoir for the examination . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed as the medical director of the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff are moving from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this was reflected in the surprising plans of the Hospital GmbH of the county , the governor of Andrea Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on yet the Supervisory Board and the t@@ dar@@ ing will take place on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if plans are put into action , all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the vast majority should be drawn to fishermen and the further existing inner station to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
the rooms are available .
&quot; the staff , who can not go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , is to be offered a work place in Wei@@ l@@ heim , thus Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
the staff were informed about their plans .
&quot; triggered the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic only since the beginning of the beginning of the medical clinic of the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question who is expected to follow and came to play according to Jo@@ chner @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; in the game , who was ready to take over the leadership of the Board of Directors from October 1st and then change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this is in any case a &quot; de@@ valuation &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the range in the area of &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ chner @-@ white . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the Internal Station on gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; for the next two years fishermen with his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees with its team , if the Supervisory Board agrees with its agree to conduct both the houses , until the next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ en@@ dom , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the county Board had planned this for 2018 , when the current recovery in the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim was completed . &quot;
&quot; Land@@ tra@@ itor Jo@@ chner @-@ white , who is also Chairman of the board of the Supervisory Board , advoc@@ ated rum@@ ors that the house , owned by the Federal Council , shall in the future be used as an accommodation for asylum @-@ moving . &quot;
&quot; the close I like it . as it goes with the property , Jo@@ chner @-@ white could not say it give several thoughts . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chiat@@ ric . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; such fishermen about the Qu@@ asi A@@ move to the Le@@ ch which was &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , who has been working as chief specialist for over 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been regularly threatened over the last decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and the Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ b@@ aller of the Rhine @-@ N@@ eck@@ ar lions are called at the Berg@@ ischen HC tonight ( 20.@@ 15 o &apos;clock ) .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundesliga is in Wuppertal , the clear favourite , occasion for the pre@@ tension , however . &quot;
in the last season the bad@@ ener saw a sore defeat at the B@@ HC and have a good breeding there .
Jag@@ ni@@ cious - two se@@ ams at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tra@@ der @-@ drivers have been severely injured during their corn @-@ harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a mast field at Pr@@ at@@ au ( Land@@ scape Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action as the police mor@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; after a down@@ stream , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could occur to the accident , it was unclear . &quot;
the Judi@@ cial Police were determined .
missed 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of non @-@ violence
a crime @-@ president has led the police for the Lei@@ che of which has been missing since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
in the inter@@ ro@@ g@@ ation there was 20 @-@ year @-@ old to have killed the young people and cast their bodies into a channel in rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
a non @-@ year @-@ old 16 @-@ year @-@ old born of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate is an op@@ ab@@ rup@@ ting to the victim .
&quot; the young woman was found at Rock@@ enh@@ ausen at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern at Kaiser@@ s@@ lau@@ tern , as pro@@ secutor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; as a pro@@ ver@@ ity , a recorded 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also deemed to be a pro@@ secutor of the death penalty . consequently , the investig@@ ator and the investig@@ ators led to the place of discovery of the cor@@ pse . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old were reported on Sunday mor@@ nings after they did not come home on the eve of a autumn in rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a autumn in rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
in the search for the young woman the investig@@ ators initially proclaimed the personal belon@@ gings of the victim .
&quot; in the surveys of the friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the dead , a crime turned out to be a crime against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged &quot; &quot; off@@ ender &quot; &quot; led the police into a canal in rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the bodies were found . &quot;
&quot; the arrested gave to the authorities in the police apparatus , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and the bodies put in the channel . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented on Wednesday the op@@ atri@@ um , the investig@@ ators lay him full @-@ attack on the burden . &quot;
clas@@ p about the near@@ er circumstances of action should bring the further investigation .
refugees need accommodations : study warned of resi@@ dency
the situation on the German apartment market is tense .
&quot; also , more and more refugees are looking for a payable place . &quot;
pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution of the German construction market have long ago begun .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with the incoming refugees and people seeking asylum from the EU more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot;
they compete with exceptional citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for payable flats , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built up to 2020 . &quot;
the outcome comes from a study on behalf of the association of &quot; social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; by comparison , this year the 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are completed in Germany . &quot;
&quot; that it has 14@@ 0.000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated for the first three months of their stay , as asylum seekers can live in an initial amount of arrival . &quot;
many come across the apartment market and turn into the long queu@@ es in front of the flats .
&quot; according to the Federal Republic of Germany , less than half of all asylum seekers stayed for rent in the last year . &quot;
the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees .
the study also makes significant om@@ issions in the construction policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany sho@@ eing a housing budget , which is bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently lacking in the metropolitan areas already existed about 77@@ ,000 units , compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professional actors have therefore lived in large cities with free @-@ penetr@@ ated in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ inten@@ tionally staying at the &quot; Hotel Mama . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per capita in recent years has fallen back for the first time . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; &quot; suggests a new start . &quot;
thereby new incentives should again boost the social housing construction .
&quot; this way , a tax tax could be wai@@ ved and the basic tax will be suspended for funded apartments . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an alliance attractive tax @-@ related de@@ preci@@ ation may be necessary . &quot;
the support programme for the refugee flow of the state bank Kf@@ W is now well received in towns and communities .
&quot; a good week after the launch was at the Mont@@ ag@@ eve of 18@@ 4 million Euros , more than half of the total amount of about 300 million Euro had been rev@@ oked . &quot;
now the project could even be extended .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia are building corridor
&quot; &quot; &quot; Hungary is virtually no longer transit out , since more and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces that the transit of Slovenia leads to the north without a hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is still dangerous . &quot;
Croatia wants to Slovenia itself with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke with the Sloven@@ ian interior minister and if necessary , we will organize a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already belonging to the Schengen area .
the EU country is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ down of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees had broken to Croatia to go from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people have arrived at the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik and reports the Croatian coun@@ sels RT@@ L .
Hungary had closed its border to refugees on Sunday .
new laws that came into force on the same day make an overwhelming asylum proceedings in Hungary practically redund@@ ant .
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
however there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the early refugees on the border to Serbia in Serbia on the morning of Serbia .
&quot; most of them are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came with the bus as well as with taxis in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d .
immediately after their arrival they would have tried to walk through the green border to Croatia .
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees arrive at the border on the border .
&quot; for this reason , the border strip contains other dangers . there are still sharp Min@@ es from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
min@@ e@@ ers should now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , close to the closure of the border hardly more refugees arrive . &quot;
on Tuesday the police were operated by 3@@ 66 .
shortly before Tor@@ p on Monday there were still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws go to overcome and damaging the border as a crime .
therefore Sz@@ eged will have been initiated in the South Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eged .
the im@@ min@@ ated detention centres of up to five years and the deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authorities , on Tuesday in the new on the border &quot; &quot; Trans@@ sitting &quot; &quot; a total of 94 refugee contracts , almost all - 93 - on the main road to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants were 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
there were still 40 refugees to be held on Wednesday .
&quot; practically , no one has a view to get into Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; after the Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; &quot; third @-@ country country &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers shall be de@@ ported there .
before the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke there were only a few hundred refugees con@@ greg@@ ated .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke began to dis@@ miss workers .
they gathered the trash that they left thousands of people in the past weeks at the road@@ side .
hing@@ es were disman@@ tled and one of the recording @-@ bearings in the bor@@ der@@ land was changed .
for the purpose of this work nobody wanted to express .
Austria we arrive at the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary only a few refugees .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
around 20,000 migrants still stopped by governmental information but still in the country . &quot;
around 1400 people in Salzburg are waiting for the further trip to Germany .
the transport traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning at the request of German authorities .
in free@@ will regularly meet smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor took part @-@ just over the borders
&quot; we were busy after the bridge to Sunday with the setup , when suddenly ten people were standing with rice charges at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ stein Mayor Alois Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to get to Pass@@ au by train . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany on Sunday but because of the refugee flow of rail transport with Austria was surprising , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; thus , the coun@@ sel immediately offered his help and the tr@@ acked together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border to the Middle Pass@@ au . &quot;
before we did shor@@ ten the un@@ hoped guests first of all , with J@@ ause and drinks . &quot;
&quot; as we said the same , we bring it to Pass@@ au by car . &quot;
&quot; that was for us a matter of course , &quot; said folk in O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
&quot; a man did not let it take , a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ bri@@ ga@@ des . &quot;
&quot; this was very happy , &quot; said the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the passengers registered passengers were killed on Sunday evening in Wels from an ICE in a regional train direction to Pass@@ au , and after the short notice , the traffic traffic to Germany was stopped , but still trying to cross the border . &quot;
the regional train was taken before the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border generally is highly advanced in the course .
the Br@@ ücken@@ ary association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ able as long as a two @-@ brid@@ led excursion - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen .
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án can send further tens of more tens of thousands , is a logical result of a seem@@ ing policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in order to help the establishment of structures that human@@ eness ensure , our Chancellor has officially lifted up and publicly the attitude of the Hungarian government into the region of National Socialism . &quot;
suffering from these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now facing the bor@@ der@@ land with chaotic conditions .
&quot; the Refu@@ ge@@ es will have to find that the &quot; gel@@ hat@@ ched country &quot; , &quot; which they invited and welcome , nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing refugee flow and the approaching winter , with us to produce decent and decent conditions for protective seekers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be even greater - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;

&quot; we have no unemployed more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; also the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who arrived on Monday to Austria were without great turmoil , Con@@ rad and praised the organizational &quot; master performance . &quot;
&quot; the interior of the Interior , on the other hand said of a &quot; &quot; evil situation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; overall , Konrad pays with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 Quart@@ z in the he@@ ur@@ ary year . &quot;
&quot; to fulfill the number , you must find 3@@ 5.000 accommodations in the next weeks - 20,000 to provide the countries , 15,000 of the covenant . &quot;
&quot; if there are more refugees , we can create it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
he has already led talks with the cent@@ uri@@ ons .
these would have secured to it even for the coming refugees .
&quot; in Upper Austria it runs fine , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar supports Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born in the morning to explain how the church is going to help .
&quot; great expectations also deals with asylum coordinator also in the OR@@ F &quot; &quot; hel@@ ves &quot; &quot; as we do . &quot;
on the platform users can offer uncomplicated accommodations .
&quot; moreover , one hopes for hotels that are empty during the winter . &quot;
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &apos; very high .
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that mer@@ arti@@ facts must respect a certain amount of the tu@@ ch@@ holder or size of the surface . &quot;
&quot; for a short time , &quot; &quot; need to be &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; being more successful as opposed to the Interior Ministry , &quot; explains Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am a older gentleman , whom one does not say without another in the face of the truth . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
finally Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause any cost as they declared themselves .
the number of employees want to increase them to three to four .
the own property search was not yet successful .
Konrad wanted to establish a container at Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with the approval . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the first time , there is no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as Tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary , as one currently can manage the persons involved without this action , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , however , further sites are to be tested for their mobility . &quot;
the critique of the city chief is committed to the division of refugees within the federal state .
&quot; also , other districts need to be made in this section . &quot;
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not closed
in a longer telephone call with the Bav@@ arian Prime Minister Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) has consolidated the continued action on the refugee question by Monday ( VP ) on Monday .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer assured me that the German borders will not be cut off .
the continuing migration of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
but there are now the appropriate border controls .
special deals with refugees from Germany will not give it any more .
but the protective search would however be brought to Germany by regular moves .
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ r has once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that also Austria leads to the border again in Austria , is &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the procedure of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
&quot; the &quot; &quot; re@@ conditioning of the &quot; &quot; New Wer@@ ft &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office building and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T set up , the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in the IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T manager Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup from the New Wer@@ ft start @-@ up and later to be summ@@ ed up .
from the very beginning S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises a lot : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time .
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site - 3 million euro from Tech@@ Center , which led to one third of the City of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is respected by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 per cent of the 2@@ 700 square meters of space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent give it inquiries . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened a second shop in the ar@@ cades
in the new shop tank @-@ hand@@ bags are at the centre of the shop .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta really wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 year @-@ old ing@@ ray of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade short @-@ up and sho@@ ve up , after all , it has now gotten some wax in the shape of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop across the shop , in which they sold all pockets , suit@@ cases , shoes and ro@@ ckets of various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around Dam@@ en@@ hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , w@@ allets are from 75 euros . &quot;
&quot; larger bags and accessories , up to 500 euros . &quot;
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
&quot; previously , several weeks has been converted . &quot;
&quot; but I have long dreamed about whether I should open a shop , &quot; says broad . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things that also the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna , from the idea of an own location where only their pur@@ se were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the sal@@ ty in the Greater Region Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; &quot; says the mother of two daughters who has his own Italian roots . &quot;
their fashion interest has gotten wide from her mother to the cradle .
it &apos;s me most when something developed and I can show new trends at an affordable prices .
why so some woman caught in the sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag in duty , the professional lady can not answer with last security .
perhaps it is because a nice bag has been upgraded any out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pf@@ alz &apos;s ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump arrived in a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ gi@@ ver .
this property also connects man@@ holes with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become the US president .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
whether he is expressing yourself to a xen@@ opho@@ bic or trans@@ lu@@ ci@@ ble in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the U.S. President ha@@ fl@@ ake the election campaign power@@ fully .
and he cuts along well .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ischen K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents of the real estate market come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the bo@@ oming market is a notion of many in the Win@@ zer@@ dorf near the Wine Road .
&quot; man@@ cher in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is more related to him via -@@ zig places , with it . &quot;
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the Elec@@ toral College . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ est copy of Simone Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do villagers think about his goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think that we find that somehow exciting , but are not so deeply impressed in her K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter type , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native k@@ all@@ ards has filmed a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring among which in addition to Tr@@ ump the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts .
&quot; ump who is not known for mod@@ esty , comes in &quot; kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too word - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not give it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although respect for the performance of the family , but Also make the opinion that Tr@@ ump &apos; be a bit &apos; a big mouth , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; in random , the nickname , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle have , &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - too high @-@ German : the dealer , says it . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tr@@ ump will come from the village of the gi@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather emigr@@ ated and opened in the USA a restaurant for min@@ er . &quot;
basic stone of the property company were first property purchases in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grandparents were not free of tragedy , their desire to return to the country for a long run , van@@ ted into the Bav@@ arian state , to whom the Palat@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t record Tr@@ ump simply because he was once kept out without the approval , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ian history and Folklore , Roland Paul , to the film start explained . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of a &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is contrast to the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
who had repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the building of a border wall to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; just as the polar , this is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote ( &quot; O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was borrowed Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers in retirement sees the American rather detached , &quot; he is always such a thousand . &quot;
does he thinks that Tr@@ ump comes ?
&quot; I cannot imagine , &quot; &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ ar@@ tery Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm was mentioned like man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant of the Heinz passed when visiting something for the church organ that was generally fine .
&quot; this can not imagine it from the Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they make it better , if he did not know the choice , for &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if this is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA , they would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more exciting topics than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not it , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; the grapes are also ripe without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els movie , for the Tr@@ ump was long interviewed , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ go@@ ers , even in the US is awakening their interest . &quot;
the Upper Bav@@ arian municipality Ram@@ sau at Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ des is Germany &apos;s first &apos; mountain gate village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the Vice @-@ Presidents of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ nov , received the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ Village in the National Park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den on Wednesday the award for soft tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain villages . &quot;
in the neighboring country the Swiss Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain gate village &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be indicated as a reserve .
&quot; Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite the attempts of Nine , to take the loss of leadership in the Today Show . &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kinson suff@@ erer to Can@@ ber@@ ra in order to report to the loss of the leadership of the Liber@@ als , but there has no big shifts in the assessment made for today . &quot;
&quot; the Fru@@ eh@@ show of Nine was released by the Federal Culture of Bavaria , as Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the Riv@@ ale Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ days , tasted in London as part of a week@@ long series of international television programs , to which also belonged to Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the fall seemed to play no role for Australian TV spectators , since sun@@ rise rose an average of 39@@ ,000 spectators among five capitals , compared to that today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today an easy increase compared to ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but his number was behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in recent months the gap to Sun@@ rise has been closed .
&quot; in August today at the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 has reached 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 33@@ 0.000 from Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now in September Sun@@ rise is at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators on 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that has happened every morning .
the winds of change affect these da@@ wns more than Parliament !

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar of them to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently wi@@ dows father , who exclu@@ des himself with his two children in the New Zealand North of New Zealand , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million spectators . &quot;
critics were asked if Thom@@ son did a hit show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; Yes . &quot;
the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and stroke The block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L . ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 5.@@ 30 p.m. ) the new Quiz show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe resolved on average 44@@ 6,000 viewers . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped on 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;

&quot; the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ? &quot;
revealing the secret ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have not kno@@ w@@ ingly manifest who The Bachelor wins . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the Sam Wood in The Bachelor , was eventually landed , was wrapped in the greatest secrecy . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one that has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we arrived with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana E@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows at the day before coming out of three , you may possibly accidentally put a critic on who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips till the final on Thursday .
&quot; all three women have om@@ itted themselves in a ly@@ ric way , why Wood is the perfect man and doing his sense of humor , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons for why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the Woods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the per@@ tur@@ ber who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called both quickly , except for themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and ( Sar@@ ai ) and Sam@@ s energies spot@@ ted , since I sen@@ sed that they were pretty compati@@ bly , and I have thought that in the whole course of the show , &quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows said . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands on the ground with both feet on the earth , so it &apos;s fun to be together with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood as a couple would be well suited .
&quot; from their view M@@ ack@@ ay said that the home visit last week you realized that Wood was of the One . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom wood was to choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl equally - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is aired on Wednesday , 7 : 30 hrs . , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the U.S. , and there were many other teams who sent forward requests for the impressive day of training at the end of last year . &quot;
&quot; but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and Trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart choice . &quot;
some coach would have been sc@@ anned for the rest of the game to the bench when he lost a scr@@ am@@ ble as he did from the Aussie Ru@@ g@@ by league &apos;s Conver@@ ting to his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota .
but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to a Pun@@ t @-@ Return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne , also publicly in his press conference . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by a team of special teams , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who ri@@ ked his ver@@ p@@ aired catch , and worry about the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne , at a Pun@@ t , restored during the first playing district of Minnesota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start to hit the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian Ge@@ Force for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the podium and told later the Australian Radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine any worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you only take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne was engaged in the Schn@@ itzer with his Ori@@ gin Deb@@ it in 2007 , when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al Area led to a Tr@@ y for Queensland . &quot;
overall it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .

&quot; otherwise , we will get verb@@ s in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the State Assembly of the Free elec@@ tors forced by Friday to Friday in the Paris Comm@@ une .
&quot; actually , there were completely different main issues . &quot;
but the record number of refugees also dominates the free vot@@ er @-@ meeting .
&quot; of course the subject entitled to over@@ lap the clause &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria and how it gave them during the 1990s during the 1990s .
&quot; so it is not going on , we need to go to the causes &quot; , &quot; said the Free elec@@ torate boss . &quot;
&quot; rejected asylum seekers , the free voters want to de@@ shift their free voters as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administrative courts , who are responsible for asylum : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ ters , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several Bundes@@ länder will not be consistent : &quot; we need nationwide standards of the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria shifts , others not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as we need to act more able . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the inland policy should not fall under the table under the table .

but that goes not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ as@@ tics who want this .
&quot; free ride at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

4 people killed after shooting poli@@ cem@@ me on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police officers in a crowd of people were demonstrating to the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke off on Tuesday evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , executive district parliament , said that more than 1,000 prot@@ esters had gathered outside a police station , some of you put stone and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ a and then shot down into the air before she took on rubber @-@ stories .
&quot; 20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , from which it is known that they may be used to kill as a less deadly alternative , apparently of such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal as the southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ei@@ i say that new provinces to be formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ ar@@ u who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officer , have been in violent sho@@ ots since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; they killed August , when the four major political parties signed an agreement , divided the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution since 2008 is on the way , but the legis@@ lators accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lature , voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court to Kathmandu and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Old Post is to be built again .
the town is currently preparing all for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; there is a combination of trade , commercial and living - concrete offers are still not available . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city Em@@ den plans to market some 4000 square meter property in a direct vicinity to the youth center Alte Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commercial and housing . &quot;
waiting for corresponding offers is called it on the part of the city .
&quot; however , which investor @-@ question may come , is not yet clear . &quot;
no contracts were closed accordingly .
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which lies on the ring road / corner of the Great road , just a few months ago and that it will s@@ nat@@ ch this building . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details lie on the table
the plan@@ ations for the dwelling @-@ place at the Little sea at Em@@ den took form .
the investor for the first time made public plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further wor@@ ris@@ ome - they fear the export of their leisure activities
&quot; T.@@ T.@@ I. has been behind closed doors , sal@@ uted , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new residence place at the Little Sea are close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , small and medium @-@ sized Em@@ powered company , &quot; set out its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Stadt@@ Develop@@ er Committee on Monday . &quot;
originally this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the day .
&quot; under the pressure of the board critic and the F@@ DP group , with the investors and the management of secrecy , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ends from the system construction management went to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet received an answer to all questions , &quot; he said before the Council members and over 50 visitors . &quot;
but it was good to be able to address all the rum@@ ors now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euros has been operating for months in the discussion .
&quot; fierce reactions among sea @-@ owners , who had come into the meeting , scre@@ amed the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and manager at the interest of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compl@@ ains : &quot; that will be a giant cl@@ ot@@ z who dominates all the other bones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he feared as several other project critics that the traffic would increase by the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; as the whole bus@@ ses have to come , so he said . &quot;
&quot; what is exactly on the good one hect@@ are of the former host site , however , is still open . &quot;
still there is no operator .
&quot; first of all , we must take a conclu@@ sive concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google starts with dou@@ bling donations campaign to earn 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . o ) announced a dou@@ bling of the $ 11 million support campaign to help the thousands of refugees crossing the European Nations , as they fled from the war and fled to impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusually personal approach when announ@@ cing the donation call on his blog .
&quot; rather than let a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google assistant who was flying with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; to our trip included many dark train and bus trips , as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugees and migrants &quot; refugees grew in Europe , many people look like my family desper@@ ately for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global earned donations have doubled up to a value of 5.5 million up to $ 5.5 million .
&quot; Europe is facing the worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many escape from the war in Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

for easy overweight diabe@@ tics can be weight loss surgery .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for mild pe@@ overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last for at least five years following a new study .
&quot; it is still too early to say whether easily overweight people with diabetes after the weight loss surgery live longer than those that have non @-@ surgical treatments . &quot;
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , which wrote an editorial related to the new study in J@@ ama . &quot;
weight loss treatment or obesity surgery use different methods to scale the size of the stomach .
&quot; they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to take up food . &quot;
&quot; over the years of obesity operations have proven to be efficient for type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in humans , which are fatty fat @-@ flo@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) from 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight , and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered being obes@@ e . &quot;
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital Data , which they collected since 2007 in a study and compare two types of obesity and ga@@ stri@@ c acid - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people , which were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those who subjected to this surgery , sank from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments , approximately equal at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who subjected to surgical procedure , triggered by 36 % the diabetes disease completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , in comparison with the diabetes , only approximately one percent and in part occurred only approximately two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were in the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gl@@ yc@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; found the authors . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the patient @-@ blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar values in the course of time . &quot;
Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent .
&quot; after the operation , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c sank from about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at some 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; &quot; - how you can be reflected in the improved here@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - decreased not the mortality in five years , so the leading researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also presented average results in the two ways of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , and Hä@@ mo@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.2 % ) , and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.@@ 1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show over survival of the surgery after five years , there are indications of a study of heavy people in Sweden , that surgery leads to a longer life , &quot; says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was among low @-@ fat people who subjected to an obesity surgery , some 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group , with conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in the surgery @-@ patient , Black@@ stone said it was cal@@ ming for people with a BM@@ I below 35 that are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without increased risk of death or a kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously , once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long until we take people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once these genetic modification has accumulated , which have linked their body with obesity and diabetes , is a revers@@ al really hard . &quot;
love story takes place in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is an issue that is currently taking place in fiction : a young woman , too popular and un@@ si@@ ghtly , hits the s@@ warm of her youth after years and he fell in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; actually we are not so &quot; by Luisa Bin@@ der .
&quot; the novel can be interesting above all for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , for he is playing in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
&quot; the main professional writer has grown up in Lang@@ wei@@ ler , and is pleased to make it a literary monument to their home town . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ news &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all refugees , said the Dalai Lama , and he added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist leaders asked to end the violence in the refugees &apos; home countries .
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten days visit in the United Kingdom in his speech to the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford on Eth@@ ics study .
he demanded that under the circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of individual nations or even continents .
he also emphas@@ ised that the reaction of West European countries is admir@@ able to the refugee crisis but the situation is not appropriate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; while the Dalai Lama &apos;s Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that there is a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; worrying about several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think long @-@ term solutions as a true peace and real development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how the killing in their countries is decreased . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force never has solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama talked about the problem of violence and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of September 11 and presented that the US &apos;s violent response has drawn a chain of un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush and I said to him , the road to solving this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he sat by violence and this has un@@ predictable consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase of intake of hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer by children in the past 4 years
&quot; poison@@ ing centers in the United States report on an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years that swal@@ low alcoholic hand san@@ i@@ ti@@ zer , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of infectious diseases in children under 12 years of age , reported by 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children come more and more frequently to these products , and sadly a percentage of them go in the ER , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children have dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants to drink their friends while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation with social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have allegedly mixing dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth@@ wash to obtain a tougher drink .
younger children can be guided by attractive fragr@@ ances of the dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ adi@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berries , grapes and orange juice , which are very appealing for children . &quot;
De@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children can only lead a few sp@@ lash of alco@@ hol@@ s to alcohol po@@ ison .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the Gi@@ ft@@ ess@@ on center in the hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the sender of Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would leave no sip whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children get involved , then there is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , recently caught four injection of straw@@ berry inf@@ ect@@ ants in school , was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood of alcoholic beverages was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that in an adult is lawful than drunk with an adult , she said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency doctor who treated them at the G@@ insignificant Medical Center outside from Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ all@@ est her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the notebook .
doctors looked at it overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of mil@@ n trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had hit the head . Rit@@ ch@@ ey said .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; said Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs &apos; mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants to use and to store the inf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
about alcohol po@@ is@@ tive and some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario women , after the hat@@ ching of the de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ shar@@ pen@@ ed ingredient . &quot;
&quot; employees of health authorities suspect that the product meth@@ anol contained , rather complex solution , rather than eth@@ anol co@@ hol , who was not@@ ated as active ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January , three pupils of the fourth grade in the state of New York , their &quot; leis@@ urely &quot; teacher to po@@ ison , using anti@@ bacterial items around the classroom , &quot; &quot; announces it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to de@@ fi@@ cide @-@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ex@@ iles them out of their space .
&quot; the police regarded the negotiated plan as &quot; &quot; car@@ av@@ tz &quot; , &quot; and in@@ tran@@ sit@@ ory measures taken by the school office . &quot;
Vill@@ ingen @-@ Sch@@ wenn@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

&quot; there are rum@@ ors about D@@ ish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was spontaneously rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this ins@@ isted that he and his team @-@ workers are not under increased control since they prepare for the confrontation with the Dutch table leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t believe that we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of the front contest in the Scottish soccer you bore - de Bo@@ er
&quot; former righ@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former nation@@ alists of the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er said that the Dutch soccer fans have lost interest in Celtic , there are no titles @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently a ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights in the Celtic Games more and why ? &quot;
because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak about both teams and this is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
I will turn around on things spar@@ ed Dei@@ la .
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight alone , but the Norwegian boss oscill@@ ating to turn things off . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the following ex@@ tras from the Champions League followed the defeat against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it just about it - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need support Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
being together is so important .

the ex @-@ Chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January @-@ transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players who come during the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group in this season .

&quot; said Mc@@ Inn@@ es : &quot; &quot; there is no team who has won everything in Po@@ wder or Li@@ gen , the games of this sort even won &apos;t win . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK as a whole .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ ,000 during the period May to July , while the number of people without labor for the United Kingdom was rising in the same period by 10,000 to 1.9 million . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate rose by 5.2 percent above that of the UK@@ s of 5.5 per cent , as demonstrated by the figures of the office for National statistics ( ONS ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , employment in Scotland fell 12 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter century , the employment rate of Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a number above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Permanent Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is almost exactly a year that Scotland has made historic decision to remain part of the UK . &quot;
in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements on the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment .

why I will become a Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man has to be put to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a audience gallery in the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma state Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ a will be executed by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation already took place in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
I agreed because I thought it would be a great way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the United States , and since often more applicants are available as seats , a mac@@ ab@@ ble lottery will take place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media platforms from 12 to five .
who is chosen will observe it em@@ otive .
I cannot do this .
I am going to sit around Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps with my own relationship with which I have developed my own relationship over the course of months with hon@@ y and a two and a half hours .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so it won &apos;t be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me of giving me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the prisoner , how he wants , and you will have access . &quot;
I describe myself with her .
&quot; they adm@@ its that she could &quot; &quot; artic@@ ulate a better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ ra had problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t say to me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it myself , even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants that an international re@@ porter was present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work towards the Death Pen@@ alty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have done . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go into all details here .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ a is innocent .
his actions after the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would be guilty of being a benefici@@ ary of action .
&quot; but I believe , that a strong probability is that he is not guilty of the murder . &quot;
&quot; I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to which you can apply for this .
&quot; what you will get from me , is what it means to die for a man a useless death . &quot;

&quot; soon , they discovered the susp@@ ects , tried to escape them towards C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me &quot; , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
&quot; at Con@@ stable Sal@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making its uniform ass , so it turned out a lot of reliable tactics - &quot; a good poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior ser@@ ge@@ ant Cast@@ le@@ dine . &quot;
master soccer player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins went to his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a boo@@ ze control and tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to sp@@ y him and threatens to end the racing sport
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards Power &apos;s ste@@ wards have tried to install a sp@@ y in his stables in the past year and re@@ pri@@ ate the race immediately .
&quot; he took over the ste@@ wards and the Integr@@ ated department of Racing Victoria , claiming that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching from Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax media that he always tries to do what is best for the racing sport , and he found himself in difficult conditions when it was about the positive g@@ im@@ itation of Cob@@ ch@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
&quot; he had returned 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage accus@@ ation , and did not want to see that it &quot; &quot; see as too high suspension . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have been eating long before , but sometimes you get so frustrating that everything goes out at once , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it was far .
sometimes you re@@ acts and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said .
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to be walking around the main walking , and I would like my owners think I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I do not do that , then I should not be any more coach . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had won the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , so that the integration team had tried to pick up his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months sat in Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr Brian Ste@@ wart in a room with a man - which I will name - and offered him a employment in my stables to deliver information about what I do within my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ amm@@ ers .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they have failed to grasp me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of the R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should I bring that to the view that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave and does not employ people outside coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take my license and contra@@ ven@@ e me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now think about it . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the trainers &apos; contributions of the trainer have built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the Li@@ ate Scr@@ ab@@ ching led to him that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ com@@ promised master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race @-@ treatment rule was &quot; ridiculous &quot; after a pack of mud or sound had been applied to the horse , which collap@@ sed against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has made mind @-@ efficient mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday so that which was so .
but it was so on the race day .
Moo@@ dy might be faced with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treating the package at the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who set up these rules , know nothing about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see one that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver must be arrested
on the weekend the police arrested a man after a clash with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent ran@@ kings in Cob@@ ram .
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley .
&quot; the police said , the driver went on , without stopping , to help the injured driver . &quot;
on Monday a 50 year old man from Nath@@ alia was the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on .
it is expected to be charged for drivers and subject assistance provided and other transport obligations .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram remains in the hospital . it is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy strikes against ri@@ vals for claims to ring back
&quot; Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ im has expressed criticism of the Tac@@ tics of his player as &quot; &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L . &quot;
Sydney Roo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ee allowed the winner players &quot; Ring struggles &quot; with his team in the qualifying race in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ bane Bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett has made a barely covered note with the Storm Team , having scored the final victory against North Queensland Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; example example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two out of Queensland are not too good &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ chan@@ ts defended the T@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of his crew and said that they were only concentrated on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; with the tactics . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ a@@ added , added that the criticism of two leading coaches in his team makes him confident , since it signifies that they were worried , to be struck by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; it emerges over and over again - I did not belong to that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring@@ ing competitions , when they took us 24 : 2 , &quot; he said Bell@@ ad on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we changed nothing in our defensive system or the techniques all year long , but during the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tou@@ t a real focus , and that has performed for us the trend turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not used to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s been strange how this time and again this season is emerging .
Bell@@ amy has attacked the idea of exciting football by the &quot; thrilling football &quot; and his ment@@ or is that Ben@@ nett St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Way@@ ne speaks from exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 , St George was a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a sh@@ re@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and playing as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
that is the balloon that you want to play when you have these kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players such as Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play them . &quot;
&quot; I build stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about having to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think of us when it was around the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against Roo@@ ster stood a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos with co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of bronze was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 but there were two more attempts at our game , but is this a thrilling game ? &quot;
or are breaks and do not make any points something related ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; if they mention us , it means that we will meet at a stage yet . &quot;
&quot; the Storm Team set off this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Queensland Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales will start from next service tomorrow . &quot;
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200.000 $ b@@ ail to drug cle@@ age
&quot; a man who could possibly threaten a life @-@ long punishment because of his temp@@ ter , in the possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine , who were scr@@ apped in Queensland , was released against a pre@@ occupation of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police made 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , who came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and presented in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the late afternoon and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a possibly liv@@ able penalty for trying to possess a commercial amount co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic argued that he tried no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been a harmless scenario . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Bo@@ agan , was concerned about the danger of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal , he lied the police on his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a b@@ ail of 200,000 dollars as a security together , in order to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the countless explanations of the two people , it is clear that the edition of a safety of 200,000 dollars represents a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but this alone will not suff@@ ice to hold him away , not to appear , warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against caution , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and his Serbian passport , announces himself every day with the police and is holding an cur@@ few of 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A@@ 5 at Karlsruhe : leaders periodic@@ ally apart
&quot; at a rear @-@ end case with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck @-@ car is badly injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three participating trucks had slo@@ wed down before a permanent residence in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried to do@@ dge in the last moment , to the left , as the police mor@@ ed . &quot;

the driver was seriously wounded within a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was fully closed for six hours until 2 pm .

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used telephone from girls to enti@@ ce p@@ ped@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used by phone of a 11 year old girl to request images of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took over the phone of the girl who slept in an on @-@ line mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children who were sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of sleeping Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through , found the confusing messages and immediately aler@@ ted her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five images analysed , analysed computers that were found at the address and discovered &quot; &quot; web research , the terms of search of un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g said it to the officers , that he did it because it was to lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le in the internet , &quot; and then he &quot; was there to be a poli@@ cem@@ an in order to sc@@ are her . &quot;
&quot; the Ombud@@ sper@@ son E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son said the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Action , &quot; he said it would be a addiction that he is addic@@ tive to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he said that the search was carried out on the computer of him , but said it was done , because he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an , to fight pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
he asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and he asked me to send even more photos .
he said he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said , he is sick in his head , when he may drink , and he said , he will then see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was in the tre@@ mb@@ ling and on crying . &quot;
she then saw the un@@ decent pictures on the phone and made the def@@ endants with them .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who saw a lot more younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , ple@@ aded guilty as to the charges of charges , un@@ decent pictures of children on June 14 last year , and not appeared before court for a hearing on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; Ambassador Gregor S@@ im requested that Ho@@ g@@ g does not appear in the register of sexual pro@@ secutor , as you argue that &quot; no real sexual element &quot; can be found in his understanding . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael cover the judgment of October to October to obtain background reports on social work .
Ho@@ g@@ g was granted deposit in this case but was kept in custody due to hear@@ ings to other cases .
he was admitted even before the date of the urine was included in the directory of the sexual offen@@ ders .
tra@@ user soft to small border dives to Germany
more and more refugees are being taken off the cross@@ roads at the Franco @-@ Austrian border .
many tra@@ user left their fear of the discovery and forti@@ tude men more often in smaller border @-@ operations
&quot; out on the Austrian side , said a narr@@ ation of the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , Ober@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn were picked up over 1,000 refugees since Tuesday . &quot;
you were walking on bridges and dri@@ ve@@ way on the German side .
they are collected from Federal Police and passed on to the registration .
&quot; at the Munich train station , Federal Railway Station ( Bundes@@ la@@ z@@ ei ) met again considerably more refugees in comparison with the weekend of the weekend . &quot;
&quot; just until 8 : 00 pm , some 700 people have arrived in the state capital , said a narr@@ ation in the morning . &quot;
after the re @-@ launch of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border had reached the city on Tuesday 17@@ 59 refugees .
&quot; Stuttgart : stamp of Tro@@ phy &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; &quot; in the South@@ west &quot;
meteor@@ ites warning against pet@@ mb@@ als in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , warm sea air currently includes warm sea air to the country divided by the German we@@ ather@@ ing ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the sturdy trou@@ ghs was the footh@@ ills of the Trop@@ ical &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which has been pulled off the Atlantic over the past few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
fierce storms and thunder@@ storms are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , it is still at the Black Forest , on the sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and at the bottom of the bottom line with bu@@ cks of 60 to 90 hour @-@ kilometers . &quot;
the sun can therefore again be seen again on Friday .
the mass makes it : every two years the car@@ makers at the IA@@ A show its novel@@ ties .
2015 is particularly popular with the comp@@ ass days which are currently very well sold .
cars from the compact class are currently especially requested : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations were recorded according to the multi @-@ fuel Federal Office ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected in the IA@@ A ( au@@ ditions 17th to 27 September ) .
&quot; this year , between all the futur@@ istic concept and new luxury cars and luxury cars will be presented above all in new compilation models this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ er for the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which will stand at the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel @-@ Chief Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition . &quot;
it belongs to the heart of the brand .
&quot; for the volume model that the volume model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra model will not become much more expensive for this purpose . &quot;
Opel offers an entry into the biggest competitor of the VW Golf in view of which it starts at 17 650 Euro .
the current A@@ stra costs from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the A@@ stra has a new 1.4 liter engine with 74 kW / 100 HP .
&quot; in addition , H@@ esse represents further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp to which also includes three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
unlike the most important cont@@ enders VW Golf and Ford Focus there is the Opel A@@ stra model first only as five @-@ fifth .
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of Kom@@ bi , which is already visible at the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will the A@@ stra show to new compact cars next to the A@@ stra ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra @-@ competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e can be seen exclusively as one @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporty GT @-@ version .
&quot; at the beginning of next year , he is also coming as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : completely new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan Alliance wants to find his position in the highly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti matches its wel@@ ded lines fully into the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 HP .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 PS .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with petrol engine , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter tur@@ bom@@ bed and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is for production information at 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) .
sales start of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not completely new , but all completely renewed is the comp@@ actor @-@ model DS 4 that is on the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n Ab@@ ad@@ ers presented primarily a hand at the front part . here the he@@ avi@@ e@@ rill was drawn and the changed lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system is moderni@@ zed , and the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and for the first time that Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play is integrated . &quot;
added to the IA@@ A in the compact class a number of over@@ work and new varieties such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I .
j@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters are in@@ humane
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner , the right @-@ cat@@ chy of the law , which had to be lived for months in a small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to receive financial compensation if they are placed in small cells . &quot;
this has decided the Federal Constitutional Court in a resolution held on Wednesday .
those affected by the judges can even hope for money if only a few days were locked in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; this was an ex @-@ prisoner , with his constitutional presentation to be successful in Karlsruhe : he was in the granting of Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel between June and November 2009 in a single cell with around five square meter floor space ; the toilet was temporarily not separ@@ ati@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who is now on the open foot according to his lawyer , has been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his office ar@@ rests due to the un@@ worthy damage of the country Berlin had failed .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court took off the judgment of the chamber in Berlin and rejected the case for the renewed exam . &quot;
you see the man &apos;s dignity injured .
chamber court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons , only a few days of imprisonment for compensation are decisive for the compensation , it was a failure . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a shor@@ tw@@ ists of the protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot;
the chamber of chamber must now clear the amount of dental damage .
the constitu@@ tion@@ ers have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; they spoke only in April an in@@ mate compensation , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; human un@@ worthy of a decision of 2011 , according to the multip@@ ole of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which an in@@ mate had agreed to an un@@ decent accommodation in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; the first pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had spread over three months daily between 15 to 21 hours , in a similar cell , as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
Berlin prisons have also come into the headlines in the past few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always enclosed within 23 hours , the aggres@@ siveness rises , even to blows , it should have happened because of the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; for information on the judicial system , 21 positions in te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior athletes , 19 should 2016 go away . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this
the immigration of refugees is a huge challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what is coming to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany following the forecasts of the Federal Ministry of asylum in Germany , according to the statement by vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany even being able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can create this and we create it .
what to come on Germany provides the following overview .
&quot; according to diverse forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Federal Ministry ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments each year - namely the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it is built until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; dramatic is the lack of living space , but above all for affordable le@@ ases : annually 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing from flat price coverage , and these particularly favourable apartments will also apply to refugees . &quot;
&quot; Minister of State in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SD@@ P ) intends to double the promotion , of currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is due to the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing a year would have to develop and therefore the federal government would need to invest 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in addition , scientists and federal ministries in it agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to the estimates of the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) , the Institute for Employment Research ( IW@@ H ) estimates that 55 percent of the refugee population in Germany can be granted . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany were not systematically asked about their qualifications in order to help them get started , he critici@@ zed Mr. Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but for the integration of refugees is decisive whether they find employment in Germany .
&quot; work is the key for social contacts , for the esteem in the reception company , but also for self @-@ esteem of the immigration society , it says refugee investig@@ ators Diet@@ rich Thr@@ aci@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt , there has been a political shift : from employment ban for refugees to recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was formerly an employment offered for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence , asylum seekers to a residential location . &quot;
&quot; in society - also because of the shortage of qualified labour , the view is imposed in the fact that refugees should be able to access the labour market faster . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle for access to the labour market is missing .
&quot; so far , there is not yet an adequate offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies show that jobs most often be conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the structure of networks is therefore according to Thr@@ es@@ hardt from the Royal Road to the re@@ integration .
&quot; Berlin &apos;s school administration has found that only a few surviving parents give their children to the kite , estimated at ten to 15 percent , &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ ot parents , it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ haz@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family in Berlin Senate . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , distribute the manuals in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators rising strong by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would attempt to increase the training capacity , for instance by bringing more specialist training . &quot;
in the countries students are being prepared without German knowledge into the teaching classes .
&quot; but they are not always taught by fully trained teachers teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have one qualification in English as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage , says Be@@ ate &apos;s suitcase of the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principal , no federal state asylum seekers or thr@@ ong the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , Interior Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has now given up his attitude . &quot;
tuition refugees could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; because refugees with a resident or d@@ ul@@ ing get no services after asylum seekers , if they start studying . &quot;
&quot; basically , the latter is not getting a BA@@ Fö@@ G , since they do not fall under the circle of the b@@ af@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to be lived four years in Germany to be eligible to BA@@ Fö@@ G entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G , from 1 January 2016 , this span@@ es shor@@ tens up to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing must also be concluded , call for Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Ber@@ lin &apos;s Secretary for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should immediately get BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and religion are more important in their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually retain the same rights to Islam , as they have the churches and develop the existing state @-@ of @-@ church right to a new state of religion . &quot;
&quot; important would also be the establishment of an Islamic welfare state , which takes care of new arrivals . &quot;
the rights also belong to their rights .
&quot; in this way , the representative of Islam must agree on clear and ready to cooperate with the state in many areas and to give him certain scope of control . &quot;
this also includes willingness to go against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern about the concern , religious conflict could also be registered in Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to pun@@ ish such conflicts in Germany have immediately their right to stay here , in Germany , in Germany , &quot; he said at Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;

integration will continue to be a topic of society in the future .
&quot; in order to cope with the majority society , the reduction of discrimination and racism will be more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - have been an anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality Act .
&quot; but it is slowly learning how the NS@@ U M@@ ord@@ series showed , in which police and authorities ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for everyone : what has long been demanded for migrants &apos; organizations and stakeholders , and to commit to international treaties such as anti @-@ rac@@ ist violence in Germany , must be in reality over the coming years and use its new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany has been able to provide medical , the expected not to medi@@ ate refugees , writes Doc@@ tor President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; concerning Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create this &quot; &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;

delivered services could later be b@@ ished with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; and long @-@ term , it is highly questionable , as many people with the limited performance catalog , I see the asylum Rights Act . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors have above all make the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far the Berlin Economics &apos; The@@ a Bor@@ de proved that migrants are worse off their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in medical offices would have to cost interpre@@ ter , it calls for . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would be helped by many refugees also in the emergency out@@ patients . &quot;
and with a different diagnostic view .
&quot; under camps , for example , there are a lot more un@@ justified disabilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ raising . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other path@@ ologies , German doctors would be aware of their formation but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not as difficult to detect . and as regards the sle@@ ek angel , whether for the refugees possibly even allevi@@ ate in sight . &quot;
Syrians had a highly developed educational system ; many refugees are even doctors .
&quot; however , in order to practice it , however , they would have to prove their qualifications once again ex@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees in Germany will be sick @-@ sick ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) psychological therapy : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress , or under depression . &quot;
&quot; being vulnerable from the refugee camp , Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , president of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study of the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee camp is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; who is at a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress @-@ disorder is suffering from among other things , in so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with respir@@ ation , di@@ zz@@ iness , cardi@@ ac and de@@ hum@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping and concentrations , strong sh@@ in@@ th@@ fulness and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to avoid that the symptoms were chron@@ ically , an early treatment is necessary , stated Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically @-@ sick refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically sufferers may ask for a request for psych@@ otherapy , however the treatment usually lasts several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly experts or doctors , who are not trained for the psychological disorders , decide whether treatment is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to day@@ dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; passion &quot; , the Circus takes its back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to drag every age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus invites in the cir@@ cus on the brick to s@@ was@@ up to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ vi@@ dent and junior @-@ junior . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - this motto is the current manager .
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been living in the hands of the family of them .
the gift of inspiration lies in the blood therefore in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their everyday life and take them for two hours into a completely different world , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year junior junior women . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ y@@ gen@@ cocktail with a world city flair , &quot; says Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the nearly 3 000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair .
the program at the cir@@ cus is convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn holds the audience with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
also the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of silent movies I want to loose the Cub@@ an duo .
ligh@@ tness and ag@@ ility - with these words identify them .
their hum@@ orous art on the mast is to conquer women &apos;s heart in the storm .
apart from numerous salmon sal@@ v@@ os the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus - also appear with finger@@ tips and jo@@ int@@ iness .
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a bul@@ let ?
for He Yuan no problem .
slim people become fascin@@ ate and scar@@ ed at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of the ac@@ rob@@ atics the little other and fascinated with her ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ese mother , Brig@@ itte . &quot;
problems in the attitude of cir@@ c@@ uses are only too often the subject of animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks also on this : &quot; &quot; it is not good to our animals , it is also not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy every str@@ ing@@ unit .
&quot; four legged g@@ sts , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read by the eyes after possibility of every wish . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal feel not well it does not want it into the arena .
the first commandment therefore : good for the animals ensure .
&quot; specially on her z@@ eb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived up eight years in a ring and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , was our small jum@@ bo da , &quot; &quot; says Brig@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is still not ready for the ring , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus . &quot;
so everyone should be doing something for each visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1 200 visitors , we always give our best and are with all the heart . &quot;
the Circus itself invites you to reach his performances from 17 to 20 September at 17 : 00 pm .
the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock , the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the animal rescue is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Sim@@ bab@@ w@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe has false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , African el@@ ester leaders , fell down from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
he remained un@@ har@@ med but the video &apos;s video quickly spread across the social media .
&quot; the opening of parliament was also clou@@ ded by asser@@ tions of members of the opposition , that they would have received anonymous death @-@ threats and they were warned of accompanying the talk of Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ines . &quot;
last month she had booked him and interrupted during his speech on the State of the nation in parliament - this is the speech which he repeated on Tuesday .
the spokes@@ man for the movement for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent n@@ ese said that seven op@@ positions and politicians have received SMS messages on their phones which they warned the Mr. Mu@@ gabe speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it gave the title &apos; death &apos; , he said to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; they warns the members of Parliament that immunity in parliament ends , and once they leave Parliament , parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said the party of Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for the politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will run up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to reduce 25.000 to 30.000 places within the context of the restructuring and saving efforts at the company &apos;s services .
HP will later split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
&quot; expected job placement results in a load of more than $ 2.7 billion , from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a competitive , sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , which is to lead the unity after separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is focused more and more than it is HP today , and we have a broad portfolio of shops that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has launched more than 50 billion annual revenue and will be focuss@@ ed on providing previously un@@ achieved , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; such as an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s from the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , and whose Pal@@ o Alto garage is called &quot; the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot; &quot;
HP has a massive restructuring where it comes to setting off from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the belief that closely focused companies achieve better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ captain Mi@@ kel Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates at the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the ver@@ last Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; turn stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it is only September , and if his rehabilitation is going according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
this optim@@ ist scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will be sure to miss at least the next four games for England and certainly is uncertain due to its history in the next summer at the European Championship .
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended up the last season after a separate ank@@ le violation and then returned to its old swing back during the pre @-@ season .
&quot; this kind of violation does not threat the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that is not well healed .
this is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it didn &apos;t stand in connection with his knees or with the injury he had previously .
&quot; it may be true from a medical point of view , but as some turn recognized , there are the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further violations , whenever a player attempts to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops a uncomfortable pattern .
&quot; the investigation of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd . , accounts for 23 different disorders by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago . &quot;
he also played in just 65 of arsen@@ als and 157 Lig@@ ator in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider image for arsen@@ al is , that in six out of eight games time since 2007 / 08 of one of the two Premier League Club , most of their vulner@@ abilities have got there . &quot;
&quot; turn accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the risk of offen@@ ders during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes when you come back of an injury , you have another period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win batt@@ iness . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body is stabili@@ zed , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal begins its Champions League season on Wednesday night at Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against tot@@ ten@@ ham hot@@ spot next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger presents itself a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelling to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud in place of im@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give players that need it to give a small batch break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal are clear favor@@ ites , passing through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is among the play@@ grounds with the biggest intimi@@ dating effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign was started in the last season . &quot;
the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening with on the Richter scale 3.2 .
this year it was the 10th of Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is of the opinion that Arsenal has drawn up the teaching of the last season with the Champions League &apos;s dic@@ ation against Monaco and remains of the distant hope , with its management the association to lead to his first Europ@@ ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out in arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not fo@@ aming . &quot;
friendly Fest : the com@@ edy show that gives us serious lessons of men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the lack of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open themselves , now even desper@@ ate as ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men were proof of a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains common in men for three times . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ sel ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 as the year of the man , with the aim of finding the culture to seek help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study on over 2,000 High School students with de@@ pressed symptoms stated that when the suff@@ erer had a enough high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery had doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to become friends and that a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of the above social media , communication with its focus on style about substance is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strongly , life @-@ fun and successful , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist ex@@ trin@@ sic values call ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and like a video @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was put .
&quot; each character has not been defined by his work , but by his personality , which shines through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when foot@@ ball@@ ers in cosy seats and the longing of Ross after Rachel - all this came out of the knowledge that men can definitely refer to , even if they often sit back , completely explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as a staff of the telephone call it told me : ... &quot; &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and confident , has demonstrated me clearly how the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us are often not able to talk with friends .
&quot; the old phrase &quot; &quot; I come with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect on how the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you are openly talking about problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that come to me in mind if I try to offer long @-@ term orientation Mechan@@ isms . &quot;
it clearly presents the little moments of men &apos;s kin@@ ships .
&quot; as much as my object @-@ friendly out@@ sider status about the telephone number the people in eyes watching despair may also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , when you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ fest with the celebration of the day completely newly designed setting , why don &apos;t you take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see somebody alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give it a smile and tell him hello . &quot;
one never knows what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - all 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ fest
&quot; di Mary meets to help PS@@ G , Malmö to cr@@ ush &quot;
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and She@@ son Cav@@ ani after his first visit to Malmö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League at Tuesday and helps to PS@@ G , to Malmö . &quot;
here are the Game Report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Gal@@ son Cav@@ ani took a course , when Paris Saint @-@ Germain took its Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ on on Tuesday started . &quot;
&quot; Mary met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ü@@ ts as PS@@ G &apos;s player who brought the French Master on their way , but afterwards she had a set of opportunities before she finally achieved a head@@ board as Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in the group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish master because they don &apos;t only asp@@ ire the qualification for the K.@@ O.@@ S rounds but an improvement along the road to the fourth @-@ final in each of the last three campaigns .
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a c@@ ass@@ esp@@ iel of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Mis@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s ) chances before the gate . he was later started in the game against his hometown Team , and against the association , with which he started his illustr@@ ating career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ wards in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , even though there are certain things that we have to perf@@ ecting in the course of season , &quot; &quot; Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t achieved one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; heading hi@@ mo@@ vic had returned to the Paris team after injury to three shifts in the Paris team , which was held on the weekend 2 : 2 Un@@ decided on the Bordeaux region in the First League , but he was now spread through Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
Argent@@ in@@ ean wing acted as the man known to the PS@@ G over the next stage in Europe when he ran into the last month from Manchester United and he indicated when he ran into Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defense before he closed to Johan Wil@@ and over nicely in the long corner of the network .
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö found the Celtic in a Play @-@ off to reach this level , joined in An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was str@@ ing@@ ed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who went far to Kevin Tr@@ coaches P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , on the other hand , PS@@ G gave herself to some f@@ ou@@ ghing and bad results , not least by Liby@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , who was at no less than five attempts at the first half of it and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he did much more skill when he brought his fellow players into the game , and it was a passport of Ex@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , which he turned into a shot shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute by the P@@ ill@@ ar ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours of the brand thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus achieved his six@@ ties , after submitting a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well by Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; finishing all the thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and just an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final result could hold low before Sp@@ ate Ez@@ e@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi have detected a door at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later to that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was December last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we played only in the Swedish league , which did not have the same level . &quot;
the qualification sounds are not enough . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : PE@@ P Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 change to FC Bayern
world and European Champion X@@ avi has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern rose obviously some years ago about the obligation of Spain &apos;s Super@@ star X@@ avi , who played back then for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times champion winner , four times champion of champion , two times runner @-@ champion , two time euro@@ pean champion , one time champion . one time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in summer , the meantime 35 @-@ year @-@ old after 24 years has spent the FC Barcelona and moved to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film coverage
Matt Dam@@ on confron@@ t@@ me the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she will not require behind the scenes .
&quot; during a wake of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actors Brown , indicated these the need for alternative perspectives , namely in terms of a black protagon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it in the occupation of the film and not for the occupation of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; wa@@ hoo ! wow . okay , when the comments of the actor by The Mar@@ tian takes himself . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined in , producing Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss about the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - who will be always the director - how they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown initially said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a N@@ ut@@ te that is defeated by her white turns . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People put himself in favor of the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film , Dam@@ on er@@ ced that their direction &quot; will give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was aired , the social media explo@@ ded from dis@@ approval by Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip by saying &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the single black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO W@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et served more than 5,000 re@@ ets and 4,000 pe@@ ers since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when the exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teenage Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white poli@@ c@@ emen , the movement of Black lives Mat@@ ter has been cultivated and sup@@ pressed against anti @-@ discrimin@@ atory practices against color content . &quot;
in February Prince Prince made a celebration on the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album silent , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums are still growing their meanings . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the movement of Black lives Mat@@ ter have published an explanation and in response to the question of Fox @-@ News @-@ Paul Has@@ en@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network of Black lives Mat@@ ter is a love @-@ group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ l , who were invited to visit the Pope in order to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
&quot; whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope , it is unclear . &quot;
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; She@@ et First Champion
&quot; professional multi @-@ clim@@ bers and control @-@ desk Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athle@@ te , who won the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or Monday night and took the Grand Prix of 1 Million $ by home . &quot;
&quot; the competition show , which is currently closed its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who finished all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the seasonal fin@@ alists there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten to finish in the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , the rock climbing was a 75 foot long climbing course in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task within the times that he was the first athle@@ te which ended the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge for three seconds quicker , leading him to the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! news after a hard @-@ fought victory , still under the shock on the profit of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I have never earned more than 10,000 $ or the life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! over his he@@ aps money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can not imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter in order to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he was finishing up the course at all , not any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the fastest time &quot; , &quot; said wo@@ ed . &quot;
how much money is a wonderful price and life changed ; it gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication .
I don &apos;t think he &apos;d swe@@ ep about any gro@@ ll .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
crowds of awards were he received by fans .
he is such a great guy and a family god .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac was just as felt when they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for a second season ; filming will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers at Minnesota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ W@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; formerly they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as a spo@@ iler , they also played their part on Tuesday at the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target Field . &quot;
&quot; the twins shed a chance of Ascension within a half of Houston Ast@@ ros , for the second American League of the game . &quot;
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ term that was difficult to seize on a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories will be fun , no matter what it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Ex@@ m . &quot;
tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon gave up his early offensive support even in Detroit three times in the first two inn@@ ings then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth place .
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times at the 1 / 3 Inn@@ es and made it possible for three ra@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at the Bull@@ ring every game , and therefore I will fully focus in the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ Hit@@ ti@@ te Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three matches , and was in two ranks , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three hit game from Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits in Seattle on July 6th .
&quot; he has written the pl@@ y@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; said aun@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( stroke training ) , looked much better at Bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three ranks in the back at the end of the seventh year , T@@ wins had the best chance to come back to the game . &quot;
center Field of B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Field of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached an unt , and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ dge to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy was a wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , in front of the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who gr@@ asp@@ ed a Two @-@ Run with the right @-@ handed rotating spin . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the end @-@ run at the second , Ver@@ ges got the third Bas@@ eman stair@@ well to a double Play . &quot;
&quot; it was the major league for the second time in this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double Play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit add an Insurance @-@ Run on the end of the ninth board , an R@@ BI @-@ Double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the W@@ hat@@ ched @-@ handed took out S@@ ano at three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ itted to the pr@@ el@@ ude of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three ra@@ uns in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been stro@@ ked before the game from the injury list , after having been missing more than a month ago because of a spinal cord . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning which I liked it , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt comfor@@ ting when I got away and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches as in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after they received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter , Hus@@ hai gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; a two @-@ out Walk of J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z led Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z , who managed to be a single &quot; up the middle &quot; on the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z abolished his 0 @-@ 21 track series with the Run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ ano followed by a single on the right hand side , got another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
the tiger submitted in the second to achieved a one @-@ out double by Cat@@ cher James McC@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony ose to the 3 @-@ 0 .
&quot; this was a great blow , &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not have a very well beaten path , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a Pit@@ ch Count , achieving no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ie@@ ver @-@ handed A@@ J.@@ A@@ ser . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es it came to three ranks with six hits and a walk with four stri@@ ke@@ epers .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ chez exp@@ ired because of an injury of the throwing debt .
he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who run the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ chez , since the middle of August on the injury list because of a shoulder @-@ block , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;

hundreds of refugees should be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the righteous people are supposed to be accommodated in Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden / Germany , like the city of Wiesbaden at the Tuesday evening . &quot;
they reck@@ on with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the H@@ esse state capital had been prepared for this case in the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees might temporarily escape .
these should then be distributed to other municipalities .
alone in the past ten days the government of charge of the government of G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in Hessen today .

Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , head of Munich &apos;s Munich Security conference , holds military action with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the dis@@ continued thinking about military action options may not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collectively . &quot;
four years ago that the cup of military involvement in Germany has been passing .
&quot; now the conflict desc@@ ends before our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls on southern and Eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner stated on the Tuesday evening in the Austrian television station OR@@ F , to Hungary no one at all returned . &quot;
also Germany has not returned refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , this is so agreed , &quot; &quot; stated . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ enting on an agreement , after which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said : &quot; &quot; in this context , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said : &quot; &quot; there have already been a relevant talks between the Direc@@ torate @-@ General for Public Safety and Labour ( Germany ) . &quot;
concrete figures cited them not and pointed out discussions on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days dozens of thousands of refugees had come across the so @-@ called Bal@@ kan@@ route from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann shared an extraordinary summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint approach to the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take a special attempt on the binding distribution of more than 120 000 refugees on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee refugee camp in Germany , the federal government wants to strongly support the countries in the initial up@@ take and distribution of the people . &quot;
&quot; together with the countries of the Federal Government , Merkel will be announced in Berlin on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultation with the Prime Minister in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ score , those people who want shelter , came this too . &quot;
&quot; but those who do not have a per@@ ch , could not remain in Germany . &quot;
this view was expressed in the round in the hand .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now be a &quot; huge force of force . &quot;
thousands of displaced refugees are now stuck in the bal@@ kan@@ route .
Hungary had closed 175 kilometers long border with Serbia on the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighboring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary plans to prevent it@@ rac@@ tors from chro@@ mium @-@ pl@@ ated across Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government shared the plan immediately .
there was first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .

they are closing researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;

&quot; although this do@@ ve movement is only small but still too big for a solid state of Heaven , it is said in a communication by the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( U.S. state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; field .
even longer it was known that under the ic@@ em@@ ic of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us it has to give liquid water .

at least in the South Pole there must be a lower sea and concluded the astronom@@ ers then .
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;

Man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy .
&quot; but who wants to pay attention to its slim line , that is often more likely to slip away from them . &quot;

Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther
almost 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Platz .
&quot; in the presence of the Republic of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino on Wednesday , a hitherto nam@@ eless place was bapti@@ sed in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill on the name of the German Reform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; on the &quot; &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of re@@ formation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the heart of Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the working group of the evangel@@ ical churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , priest of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an church in Rome , reminded the Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were over centuries as a minority often only in hidden their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the square , I become visible in symbolic manner that the traditions of Christian faith are welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the end of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city then as a sin @-@ sin .
his negative impressions are likely to influence him in his later struggle against Rome .
&quot; Lu@@ ther , then , with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ las@@ so , took over the split of the Liv@@ onian Church . &quot;
hammer artists invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ il@@ ded ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old has painted over his Bible .
Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail has written the introduction and a Bible text .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which is now appearing with gorgeous paintings . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the image for Ot@@ mar Old , who formulated in 150 moti@@ fs his completely personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the respective subjects can be adjusted , it can quite seem quite dark . &quot;
&quot; about three years Ot@@ mar Old has worked on his Bible project for which he met a subjective @-@ artistic choice from the many thematic sections of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles developed are cycles that are dedicated to topics such as cru@@ x , pl@@ agues , and@@ ments or father@@ hood . &quot;
so he has spontaneously fascinated several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler @-@ publisher with its focus on art @-@ books .
and there is above all the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ aser designed to work on the basis of painting with the respective Bible positions .
&quot; he interpreted the scriptures from Ot@@ mar Old selected Bible and thus transl@@ ating into present &quot; &quot; current relationships &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are as verbal mirror of Al@@ ts Pain@@ ting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original Bible writers from Martin Lu@@ ther , and one of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts about the respective situation here . &quot;
the jewelry @-@ band has golden letters .
thus the 75 @-@ year @-@ old is allowed to take a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately a trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Old , born 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and raised in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruling order . &quot;
&quot; then the education already happened with the pipe stock , &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Old . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have tried to stop working to wear myself with the Lord himself again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is to be of again significance in art in the quick@@ est time : &quot; &quot; the perception of cap@@ tions is now characterized by advertising , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is stood out there .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
images always have some secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to leave the viewer into the pictures , &quot; drawing up &quot; , &quot; discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; the picture looks for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Al@@ te@@ mail presented on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , which is always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like how he understands lives with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I am not paying attention to others , to fully grasp the Bible but which is important to him , even mysterious topics . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text explains merely &quot; . &quot; it was a piece of pictures . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Lu@@ ther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deepen life and to find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for Mö@@ h@@ ler ( biblical ) language of love as well as that of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the original - sheet and linen models - presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
construction starts for BM@@ X by means
&quot; plans made , place found place , company commissioned to model ground @-@ ke@@ epers for a round course : one year later everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was almost finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration provided for displ@@ ac@@ ement , especially in the residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus hills from above , new place looked for - now with formal planning and request for building permit . &quot;
the approval was going to enter in October could inform the First Joint P@@ Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in Children &apos;s and Youth Committee .
&quot; I hope this year was even more visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without &quot; &quot; further notice &quot; &quot; with the works at the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensified commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B increases its commitment to refugees and 2019 , the Bundesliga will be showing a clear sign of the German Bundesliga . &quot;
&quot; the football re@@ acts to the state of affairs in Germany , as well as ensuring the policy to cope with the coming problems . &quot;
&quot; I consider this to be the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there no one can say in principle , that is nothing about me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be interested in each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B boss Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am the next Wednesday in the chan@@ cell@@ or and leave the state Minister there in Mrs Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ l@@ z , and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; since the topic will certainly play a key role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the soccer can and wants to help .
but the main course does not have to place politics .
therefore the German Bundesliga team has thus extended its refugees initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; to four years .
&quot; about the Braun &apos;s E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Foundation , we ensured that this program runs until 2019 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach explained at the margins of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Juli@@ an@@ ov / Malta . &quot;
also some federal states support this program .
&quot; this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ b set a clear sign when they are on the left Tri@@ kot@@ z@@ mel instead of the otherwise standard sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the imprint &quot; &quot; We can help - # 8217 ; welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; the refugee @-@ drama is every one of us , no one should let away . &quot;
&quot; we can use soccer acade@@ my , no , we have to use our spotlight , our influence and our opportunities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;

Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as a &quot; great joint project of German football . &quot;
all 36 license definitions in their places have started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association represents about 300 000 euros together with the DF@@ B selection and the German Federal Government . &quot;

reports : SAP @-@ Board @-@ chief loses an eye in the accident
&quot; leading President of the greatest Software Group , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has lost its left eye several reports by down@@ fall in the beginning of July . &quot;
&quot; he had fallen at the foot on the stair@@ way in his brother &apos;s house in the USA after midnight on a water jar , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; &quot; economic week &quot; &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is nearly blood@@ shed , was impot@@ ent and then to@@ wed out on the street - that he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ fe &quot; SAP @-@ room@@ mate H@@ asso plat@@ former . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t might follow his job .
&quot; beginning October we meet in front of the Supervisory Board at Wall@@ dorf &quot; , &quot; said yes . &quot;
the 54 years old manager was involved in the meeting and &quot; fully fit . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; &quot; on Thursday , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the group . &quot;
&quot; I am very happy for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its President H@@ asso plat@@ former , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually com@@ mu@@ te between Germany and the USA , but since the summer it was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen such a thing . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , once you have fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ spare pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen besides skir@@ mish ...
&quot; Magn@@ us@@ sen was a corresponding photograph and explained , he suffered the damage when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel . &quot;
he therefore comes to a separate part in Singapore on the weekend as little as a reservoir for the two pedi@@ atri@@ ots of Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son Button , like one week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
soccer : BV@@ B without Re@@ action against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : course at the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes were finally broken for a com@@ eback from Marco Re@@ us in the first group Game of the Europe League . &quot;
the National @-@ player is missing the Table of the Bundesliga as well as in the Du@@ el with the FR@@ P Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7@@ am / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we can not rely on him , &quot; &quot; said Thomas K@@ nu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach was open again , leaving the BV@@ B @-@ Coach : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high burden of his professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change his regular eleven positions at the prec@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ way position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ el@@ eller is taking place from the place of Chief of Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football teacher the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether past@@ ure @-@ f@@ eller in the future comes to be used in all of the Europe league games , but were open to Tu@@ ck@@ les . &quot;
with high probability it is also the second parti@@ san .
&quot; the for@@ ging statement of Mit@@ ch Re@@ us , that the final statement for the BV@@ B in the Europe League has to be the goal , holding mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for veri@@ fiable : &quot; this is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot@@ ic au@@ tos : government wants to be the cutting edge for Germany
&quot; Germany should be a pioneer during the creation of the German Federal Government , on the basis of the German federal government . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Cab@@ inet Secretary decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Alexander Do@@ de@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; at the end of Wednesday , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on the ver@@ ge of the &quot; &quot; new Mobile Age &quot; &quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; automated , connected driving will increase the road safety and ensure less st@@ amping , &quot; &quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt said . &quot;
&quot; he will also discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 states , which at the IA@@ A also come together with representatives of the industry . &quot;
the strategy paper of the traffic department emphasises the importance of mobile broad@@ band integration and a rapid increase on digital radio .
&quot; currently , a test deal on the highway 9 in Bavaria is currently being created . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver &quot; &quot; no additional liability risks are considered , &quot; &quot; the federal government wants to verify the legal framework &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus , Germany wishes to use approximately internationally for its permitted maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars of 10 to 130 kilometers . &quot;
&quot; the German Federal Government will also intend to introduce a change to the Vienna Convention , which only fores@@ ees people as a driver so far . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
&quot; the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras , which process the environment and process data in a matter of seconds . &quot;
&quot; after a study was presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , an automated driving will be technically possible for motor@@ ways by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , less driving cars on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; added value in the field of driver assistance systems and high @-@ automated driving functions at the location of Germany , the authors of the study value for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the passenger can lead to more safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ commerce agency for S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
but the issue of liability in accidents and security of the personal data of the drivers must be clarified .
but the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars still see scep@@ tical - much more than French or American .
&quot; one on Wednesday at the AA pre @-@ presented survey of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Test of DE@@ K@@ RA , that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will enforce only in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of respondents said to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a clearing up the Digital Chamber of Digital glau@@ coma , only seven percent would consent to dis@@ solve the control throughout the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the highway , that could be at least 15 percent in flowing traffic , in St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , every fourth of the Fourth would leave the car under no circumstances . &quot;

the final decision is to fall at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ head during the EM @-@ Course in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this time , B@@ oll found itself on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsor@@ ing rate in China . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for a duck !
it is a mixture of very great fashion show and a hair@@ dr@@ one cab@@ aret : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition at his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins that are terri@@ fying human thanks to video proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer who among other things became the big star of the fashion show - and with it that he put men in skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant of Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; earlier it was b@@ anded , in the meantime it &apos;s genuine , &quot; &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; for visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The S@@ ide@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from September 18 to at the Kuns@@ thalle of the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , it is a good fortune that the mo@@ des@@ k@@ av@@ ter has changed its initially rej@@ ection@@ ery attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he had been against it , for : &quot; for me an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you get into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Canada &apos;s Montreal and Paris station .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the art hall , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits offer an insight into the work of the man who has written the fashion history , without ever having completed a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not constructed , but it is a beautifully chore@@ ograp@@ her entire work , which was run for much effort : in order to rec@@ ise the dolls , for example , was engaged as a sty@@ list . &quot;
&quot; 14 tons of material made the movers according to the curator , Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot in Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special Sch@@ man@@ ker@@ l : a le@@ der@@ h@@ osen @-@ fit for cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he was always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are s@@ lau@@ ghing as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ ors @-@ old Ted@@ dy is seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d sal@@ v@@ ages of a designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he has attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and his clothes , &quot; Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
&quot; playing a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he got the un@@ throw from fashion later on .
&quot; he suffered fashion journals and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers , like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought that but of course .
for his first own fashion show he cannot pay the Mod@@ els .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; formerly there went to the long embro@@ ider@@ ies in and around pl@@ cks , making meters . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered materials and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , for example they had to keep on blankets and she@@ ers to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the Mo@@ auction . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
&quot; in the early times of the top position , fashion played a major role , was then sup@@ pressed by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt calls some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as pockets and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; all the so @-@ called vintage @-@ fashion , which uses past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ ets , become a growing supplier . &quot;
whoever does not charge any niche in the textiles industry in Germany is no longer at the market .
with us they already do half of all orders .
Mo@@ gau@@ ge Pl@@ auen is a member of the branch of the industry for the industry of the industry .
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
in the last 15 years some 80 percent of the revenue has been broken .
private specialist stores and also the wholesale trade are almost no more .
we hardly reach our products in this way .
the mass mass is today produced in the Asian region much cheaper and almost exclusively distributed over chains .
&quot; finally , weak@@ ening of exports , currently to Russia and to the USA . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new paths .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Martin is explained by the nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ ken@@ stein : &quot; &quot; this year we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also relates to the materials used . &quot;
Diplom@@ a Schmidt teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger office of the Western Sax@@ on Academy of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Fac@@ ulty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; arising from the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and operations , which must think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
that is why an existing design often only varies slightly to hold a customer base .
a few years ago the bustling textile design in Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was new to the historic gl@@ ist@@ all@@ ine tip .
the machine attracts small cows in some places .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener Gold@@ sch@@ ie@@ de@@ mann in Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ Kr@@ o@@ e could be inspired from it , &quot; previously I could not start anything with traditional platinum . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ tip for their jewellery .
in an elaborate process they dominate the pattern in silver .
&quot; many people of the region identify with the subject &quot; &quot; Pl@@ au@@ ener &quot; &quot; - young and old , &quot; &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; she also delivers to the USA , to Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in showers and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
this means that I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze .

XI suggests the economy to open wider for the world
&quot; the economy must open themselves wider to the outside to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group called on reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; in addition , China should appoint foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for start @-@ ups &apos; , he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Chief Group for deepening an comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to foster new start @-@ ups and deliver reforms to boost new momentum and vitality and offer new place for economic growth , X@@ i said . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list to control the market access , relaxation of the border controls , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , to take up private capital , and over@@ haul of the population Mel@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; on the statement , a negative list is generated , which identifies sectors and companies that cannot be challenged to investments . &quot;
the system is tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; this initiative is of importance because it gives the market a greater role in the allocation of resources , a legally state @-@ owned business environment and open the market more open , the statement said . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure businesses decide how to run their business .
&quot; the statement also said that China will allow China border @-@ areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border business cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , there will be further areas for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy to foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is made easier for foreigners ; apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by improving the requirements and the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activity , and to use professional judges and pro@@ secut@@ ors , also discussed at a meeting . &quot;

EU wants to double the mer@@ cury threshold in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limits for mer@@ cury in big predat@@ ory fishing and consumers thereby bring a significantly higher dose of nerve growth .
&quot; consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , which is presenting an appropriate work@@ book of the EU , critici@@ zed the plans sharp : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects of mis@@ understanding and environmental policy are passed on with full impact on pregnant and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t said , that the threshold values of the nerve po@@ is@@ oned for big fish at the end of the food chain like about Haiti or s@@ word@@ fish from &quot; economic reasons &quot; can be raised from one on two milli@@ gram Qu@@ mer@@ cury . &quot;
&quot; however , big predat@@ ory fish were so heavily imp@@ aired with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the existing threshold values about 50 per cent of the cor@@ ds can not be sold . &quot;
after the dou@@ bling of the threshold values then only 14.@@ 5 percent would be impossible .
&quot; in return for this attrac@@ tant , the EU wants to increase the threshold values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram on 0,@@ 1 milli@@ gram Qu@@ eck@@ silver per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch was awarded this as &quot; trick &quot; because smaller plac@@ em@@ fish , as some car@@ p usually are as low @-@ charged , that they already keep the intended maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the distr@@ action in Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ ant of the distr@@ action , which alone helps business , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a heavy duty for humans with a high @-@ poison@@ ous heavy @-@ fish across the food chain mainly in predat@@ or .
&quot; the German government therefore warned that &quot; &quot; small quantities are particularly likely to cause un@@ born impair@@ ments of the nervous system . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment of the Federal Environment Agency explains on its homepage with regard to the valid values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly caused by coal burning into the environment .
&quot; according to a written request from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal deleg@@ ate Ann@@ apolis Ba@@ er@@ ate took over six tons of mer@@ cury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity of total in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish roughly in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; durable and nationwide &quot; , &quot; had quoted the &quot; mirror &quot; in March from the paper . &quot;
last year long @-@ pan @-@ wide warnings of mer@@ cury in fish has already been among the most common health risks in the EU @-@ War@@ n@@ th RA@@ S@@ FF .
