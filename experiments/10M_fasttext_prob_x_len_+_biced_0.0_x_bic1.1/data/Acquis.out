C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the organization are so set up that i ) the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and disorder in the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear activities are as small as possible ;
II ) the protection of industrial sec@@ rec@@ y and other inspec@@ tors of the organization to be aware of the confi@@ dential information .
&quot; each state applies to the organisation , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as their inspec@@ tors and other officials to con@@ struct the relevant provisions relating to the Convention on the privileg@@ es and deliver@@ ances of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organisation . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this agreement is termin@@ ated in relation to core materials if the community and the organization have been used , that the material is consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is used for nuclear activity , which is not usable or practically non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; the community is noti@@ fied by the organisation according to this agreement , the transmission of core material from the states that subject to securing the securing measures after the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures after this Convention will end in relation to core materials as soon as the receiving state , as planned in this agreement , is responsible for the responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organization takes documents , from which every transfer , and , if necessary , the re@@ application of the securing measures on the more advanced core material goes forth . &quot;
&quot; the core material , securing measures according to this Convention , should be used in non @-@ nuclear activities such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so agreed the community with the organisation of such a material , under which circumstances the securing measures will be termin@@ ated according to this agreement in regard to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used during the period of non @-@ application the securing measures after the production of nuclear weapons and other core spr@@ inkl@@ ers .
&quot; B ) The organization and community meet a rule , that the securing measures must be applied for so long as long as the core material used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , this securing measures will not be used as long as possible . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures will again be applied once again , as soon as the core material becomes again a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
&quot; the organization is held across the total volume and the composition of this material from the state or the relevant states , and through any dis@@ closure of such material from this state or these states . &quot;
&quot; this explains its agreement as quickly as possible ; it is based on issues such as temp@@ oral and proce@@ eding for reporting , but does not exclu@@ de an amount or under secret protection standing knowledge and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states carry the costs of growing each of them in implementing their respective comm@@ itments from the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , the States or persons , which are subject to its territory , however , extraordinary costs due to a special request of the organization , will be ref@@ unded to the organization that provided it in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization carries the cost of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states make sure that the liability protection for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , is based on the organisation and its officials for the purposes of implementing this agreement in the same way as to the nationals of the states . &quot;
&quot; every claim to claim the community or a state to the organization or the organization across the organization or the organization for damages - with the exception of damage from a nuclear incident , resulting from the implementation of the securing measures according to the Convention is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; according to the audit , the Council exam@@ ines that the organization is not able to make sure that the organization is not able to make sure that no core material , which must be subjected to the securing measures in accordance with this Convention securing measures , so he may also make provision for nuclear weapons or other nuclear war@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which mass was obtained by the applied securing measures , and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contra@@ ctual parties is concerned - any advoc@@ ate opportunity to grant the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state , consultations are held on questions that arise from the design or application of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to re@@ prove that questions that arise from the design or application of this agreement , will be checked by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the disp@@ utes of such questions through the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disp@@ utes agreed to a conclusion of the procedure to article 19 or one of the counsel , disp@@ utes ar@@ ising from the design or application of this agreement and which are not in negoti@@ ating or by another of the organization , the Community and the States agreed to sub@@ ordin@@ ate the party to an arbit@@ ral tribunal to provide five arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the States named two arbit@@ rators , the organisation also named two arbit@@ rators , and the four so called refer@@ ee choose a fifth that ch@@ aired the chair@@ person . &quot;
&quot; have the community and the States or the organization within thirty days after the request to an arbit@@ ral tribunal not named after two arbit@@ rators , then the community or the organisation can inv@@ ade the President of the International Tribunal to name this arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is to apply if within thirty days after the nam@@ ing or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ rators , the fifth arbitr@@ ator was not yet selected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court is compulsory , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court decisions are legally binding for the organization , community , and affected States . &quot;
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs for non @-@ core insur@@ g@@ ents , the Treaty of Treaty of the Treaty , and members of the association , into force , i ) , when the State of the organization is noti@@ fied , that its methods are concluded for the force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; II ) When the community is noti@@ fied , they are able to apply their securing measures in relation to this state for the purposes of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the States consult each other on request of the contract parties via a change of the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the approval of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The Director General teaches all member states of the organisation immediately of any change of the Convention .
&quot; a ) This agreement occurs on the day in force , by which the organisation of the Community and the States receives written notification , so that their procedures are to enter into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention will remain in force as long as the states of the Treaty of the Treaty .
the agreement &quot; Convention &quot; the Convention and the Protocol called together in this agreement .
&quot; purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedure under implementation of the I via securing measures , as required . &quot;
the aim of the implementation of the securing measures in this agreement is the tim@@ ely discovery of a significant quantity of nuclear waste material for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear program for unknown purposes as well as the deter@@ rence of such a decrease by the risk of early discovery .
&quot; for the extraction of the target in article 28 , the material accounting is used as a securing relief of basic importance , con@@ und@@ ance with spatial integration and observation as an important supplem@@ entary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the tests performed by the organization is performed by an explanation in which for any material image zone , which is listed for a period of period , the accuracy of accuracy is listed for the specified limit . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their investigations , the organization takes 3 full use of the community &apos;s security system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the community for core materials according to this agreement is based on an breakdown in material zones .
&quot; if the use of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will take advantage of the following kind of use and , as far as required , as far as required , as they are intended in supplem@@ ental evenings and purpose services are : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of preserved , her@@ ded , lost , lost or other way out of the stock &apos;s core material and of the stock exchange ; &quot;
B ) evalu@@ ating the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurement and accuracy of measurement un@@ certainty ;
&quot; C ) Process for determining , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recei@@ vers ; &quot;
e ) method for assessment of accumulation does not measured stocks and not measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which indicated for any material image zone the core material and the changes of this top , including the one - and outputs of the material image zone ; &quot;
&quot; g ) To make sure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly , &quot;
h ) Proce@@ dures to refund reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures after this agreement extends not to material in the mining or on the mines .
&quot; B ) becomes Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ ed material that has not yet reached the phase of the core burning cycle in the states , so the community of the organization divi@@ des the amount and composition of the material , if it is not introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes . &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for the fuel production or the process phase , in which it is manufactured , or will be introduced to the core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear waste sub@@ merged core material , so it is subject to the other in this agreement for securing measures . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures in this Agreement are termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 11 . if the application of core material , securing measures after the Convention is subject to the agreement , the organisation and the community is not allowed to consult a common securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures in this Agreement shall be termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , as long as the organization and the community understood that this core material is virtually non @-@ profit . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community , the organization freed the following core material from securing measures according to the Convention : &quot;
&quot; a ) special fixed material , if it is used in gram - or smaller quantities as sensor in instruments ; &quot;
&quot; B ) core material , if it is used for non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such core material is re@@ plac@@ eable , and &quot;
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ onium with a is@@ ot@@ ion concentration of pl@@ ut@@ onium @-@ 238 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community exemp@@ t the organization of core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures according to this agreement , provided the entire basis due to this article in the States liberated nuclear material amounts to no longer than any time . &quot;
a ) a total of a kilogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with a en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , it calcul@@ ates the multip@@ lication of his weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with a en@@ rich@@ ment that is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural uran can be calculated with the multip@@ lication of his weight with the fifth square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or among them ;
&quot; the core material , together with core material , is supposed to be subject to the securing measures after the Convention is subject to process or stored , then proce@@ eding for the re@@ application of the securing measures on that material may be made . &quot;
&quot; the community meets the organisation of supplem@@ entary sampling , which is required in the scope of the implementation of the organisation based on the implementation of the organisation according to the agreement , as specified in the procedure specified in the Convention . &quot;
the complem@@ entary agreements can be expanded or changed without changing the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the complem@@ entary abor@@ tions occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible , following the entry into force . the organization , the community and the states are able to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this limit requires the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; the organization is based on the basis of the initial inventory volume of the total , securing measures of the total related material in the states , regardless of its origin , and results on this inventory volume due to the subsequent reports and results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the other hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ Y NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER reasons - a ) The EEC agreed to contribute to the international economic cooperation agreement for international economic cooperation with low @-@ income countries , whose development is imp@@ aired by universal resource rans@@ fer@@ ous problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the goal of the EEC and Member States , that the total of the Member States will be issued within six months after inhal@@ ing the agreement and as far as possible within two years after inhal@@ ation in the form of loans , and the organisation will do their possibility to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have cons@@ ul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the organization of the EEC has submitted a table from which it is intenti@@ onal , in which way they intended to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is aimed at a special account under the name &quot; &quot; special shareholders &quot; , &quot; which consists of the funds provided by the organisation under this agreement as the administrator of tre@@ sp@@ elling and uses ( in this feature the organisation will be defined as the &quot; &quot; administrator &quot; ) , and only to the provisions set in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the special ac@@ tionary account is se@@ per@@ ated separately , separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization . &quot;
&quot; as follows , the contributions are as follows : a ) Payment will be paid in the form of cash or in@@ corporate training of the member state to pay attention in the currency of the organization as the administrator of the special shareholder and place in the organisation of the organization in the supporting country . &quot;
B ) Payment will be at least 45 v . h ) the first deposit of at least 45 v . h . the post within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the administrator agreed ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of residual amount to 1 January 1979 or at a different time , which was agreed between the EEC and the administrator , taking into account for the parliamentary approval of the annual bud@@ get@@ ary plans . &quot;
C ) Every member state can afford payments in advance of the above dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedure of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker will take a proportional impact on cash or the bill to cover the expenses for special action and the special ac@@ tionary account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; when providing this loan , the administrator can conduct the following factors according to the EEC : &quot;
III ) to the extent that international economic factors contributed to the current and fore@@ se@@ eable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and tendency towards debt service of the country and its further lending capacity to loan conditions without imp@@ orter ; and
VII ) the circum@@ ference in which the problems of supporting countries should be made by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special actor , the financing of a clear risk and swi@@ ft@@ able development program or sub@@ lime ( including a sec@@ toral analysis ) , which is assessed and managed by the process and practices , which is approved , approved and administered by the claims of the organisation which is named under letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the funding of the special shareholders may not be used instead of full means of the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or Organisation , which has already been approved by the Bank or Organisation for a program or project , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s Directors of the Bank or organisation . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 are subject to special provisions on the same amount of payment , which are generally accepted by the organization , and therefore , in ten years , they are pay@@ able in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; special acts are granted in one or more currencies in the Member States , and are pay@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
&quot; to pay the charge of this security clock , directly to the organization that they can enter . &quot;
&quot; each special request agreement is indicated by a separate loan agreements between the recipient and the administrator , in which particular the origin of the means is stated . &quot;
&quot; the income from every special action can be used for issues in the recipient of the recipient or for goods or services , which are provided , respectively ) in a member state ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organisation , and according to what the administrator at the time of the loan granted , could be a recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; in the currency of a special transaction , the amount paid to the special shareholders , and the amount paid in the currency of a member state , as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State . &quot;
&quot; the administrator teaches the EEC as well as full completion of all special claims by the EEC , establishing the directors and programmes approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the period of the under@@ carriage of the special transaction , the administrator teaches the EEC quarterly on the development of special acute and supporting expenses . &quot;
&quot; the administrator transmitted to the EEC as soon as possible , according to the conclusion of the organization &apos;s special ac@@ tionary accounts with a statement from the external audit@@ or of the organisation to this account . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible , the administrator of the EEC transfers the EEC as soon as possible , as soon as possible , as a detailed report on the account surveys and programs . &quot;
&quot; the administrator created and performs suitable recordings and accounts , from which the contributions to the special ac@@ tionary account , which received from the accounts and paid out from the account and are confident of payments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the administrator are working closely together to achieving the goals of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ wards up to complete edition of the special shareholders &quot; means of time to time a thought of thought over the status of special shareholders , which affect the course of special ac@@ tionary programmes or projects and on all other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is signed on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , that the EEC and the Organisation may be agreed not into force , so the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are ob@@ sol@@ ete with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; according to Article II Section 8 of this agreement , the total capital amounts of all by the recei@@ vers are rep@@ elled and transferred to the Member States , so this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires permission by the Member States and the EEC concerning the legal rules of each party .
&quot; the Member States of the Member States , the Secret@@ ariat of the Council of the European Communities , outlines the conclusion of the proceedings concerned . &quot;
the Secret@@ ariat tells these noti@@ fications along with an noti@@ fications about the correct approval of this agreement by the EEC .
this agreement is effective and occurs in force on the first day of the month following the noti@@ fications of the noti@@ fications of the noti@@ fications .
&quot; this agreement is made in two origin@@ als in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , with each word that equally is binding . &quot;
&quot; considering that the agreement in the form of a letter change to the change of Annex A of the Protocol no . 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , H@@ AT was issued : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation on the controlled core fusion and Plas@@ m@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs
&quot; called the EURO@@ P@@ Ã@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy , called &quot; Euratom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after , called &quot; Commission , &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called &quot; Bundes@@ rat &quot; ) , &quot;
&quot; this programme comprises the creation of a large testing system , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a Common company named after the Chapter V of the Euratom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs and is well familiar with the supporting area . &quot;
&quot; as far as to practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , there is still extensive work to summar@@ ize its relevant effort to avoid unnecessary over@@ cuts and obtain their respective research , which have attained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is to set up every party party into the situation , through a summary of their research concerns relating to the field of controlled nuclear fusion and Plas@@ m@@ aphy@@ si@@ cs , according to the joint goal of this research work , i.e. , the cost @-@ competitive electricity generation through use of controlled core activity reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objectives of the present agreement , the contract parties will be associated to Annex I and II of this agreement defined research programmes , below &quot; &quot; Euratom programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term targets and forms of the cooperation of the Euratom programme ; it will be expanded or modified in accordance with Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , that there may be new activities relevant to the Euratom programme . &quot;
&quot; every time , when the parties accept a new program , this will take place in Annex I and II to the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the association specified in paragraph 1 is realised through : - appropriate participation in each of the contract parties , preparing and implementation of the other party programmes ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under the supervision of laboratory laboratories in the Euratom Member States , in Switzerland and in the third countries , with which Euratom should be a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratory theories , which work on the Euratom programme ; &quot;
- suggest@@ ive right to access to the scientific and technical results of their respective programs .
&quot; within the framework of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the project J@@ ET . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the implementation of the association agreement , the contract parties signed a association contract , called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those signed between the Commission and the states and individuals , herein@@ after referred to &quot; Association of Association , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Euratom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Euratom will ensure that Switzerland is involved with the time of the force participation in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which will be concluded between the Commission and the associated organs , below &quot; Convention on Human Development . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland has been involved with the date of the implementation of the common company J@@ ET , whose stat@@ ute they accepted . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Euratom requires concern that the contract partners will be subject to any contract , except for association contracts , or other similar contracts concluded by Euratom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;

in the form of a letter from the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine@@ an Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ ate

&quot; - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export options for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat from Argentina following the community are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a perfect function of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the fact that the agreed amount does not exceed the agreed amount and is carried out according to conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change of the offer form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the under number 10 mentioned to find appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in case of the case that the community takes care of the protection clause , they are obliged to concern yourself to concern that this agreement was not affected in this agreement to the common market of Argentina . &quot;

&quot; under number 2 , the total number of people &apos;s accession to the community is set on 23 000 tons of slaugh@@ ter@@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid a market development , which could affect the marketing Argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el and L@@ amm@@ un@@ es on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets the opposite of inter@@ vention@@ marks of frozen meat based on frozen meat due to the implementation of the Regulation ( argent@@ inian H@@ amm@@ el ) and le@@ dge . &quot;
&quot; taking into consideration the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community is agreed that any actual application of replacement or other convey@@ ing measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb , as well as for the contemp@@ t of certain sheep and lambs , are in line with the existing international obligations and the traditional share of the community in the world trade with these products . &quot;

&quot; he regularly exam@@ ines the tendency towards the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and sheep market of both parties and on the world market as well as the terms of conditions on these markets , including conditions that are called for under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is worried that the correct use of this agreement is not affected by this agreement , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat should not be executed under the agreement after the community . &quot;
&quot; all questions arise regarding the implementation of this agreement , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;

&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep &apos;s economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el - and lamb &apos;s meat in the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy must not be imp@@ acted , I ad@@ ore myself to propose the following agreement : &quot;

&quot; after this agreement , New Zealand , for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and sheep , will be secured access to the European Union &apos;s market access to the market . &quot;

the World Health Organisation has set for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D reag@@ ents to the blood group measurement International Standards and for reag@@ ents of other specific@@ ity are executed at the time standards .
&quot; according to definition , a International standard preparations contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles that are observed in individual preparations ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the reag@@ ents to the blood group determination of most speci@@ f@@ ics is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ st@@ ites that is observed in a series of di@@ lution with a ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te sul@@ try .
&quot; the tit@@ er gives the di@@ lution of the reag@@ ent in the last mix within a series , where a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of the reag@@ ents to the blood group determination are present ( at the time Anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as indirect anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed in comparison to the International standard prepar@@ ative or state national park in International Units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 . ) . &quot;

&quot; reag@@ ents to the blood group determination are in such a way to distribut@@ ing such amounts , not only to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells . &quot;
the amount specified in a container must be so big that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has over all production levels and controls of the reag@@ ents to the blood @-@ group measurement records .
&quot; appropriate samples from all ages of reag@@ ents are so long to store by the laboratory , so that the batch can no longer be used . &quot;
&quot; the reag@@ ents used for blood @-@ determination can contain substances human , animal , vegetable ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective share , the others are the necessary tools for ampli@@ fy the effectiveness and preser@@ vation of the reag@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these reag@@ ents are divided according to the origin of their effective anchor in three groups . &quot;
this does not mean that the reag@@ ents of human origin contain exclusively substances of human origin or that animal or vegetable reag@@ ents do not contain substances of human origin .
&quot; on each single container , a black @-@ and @-@ white label is available in English and French , which contains the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
