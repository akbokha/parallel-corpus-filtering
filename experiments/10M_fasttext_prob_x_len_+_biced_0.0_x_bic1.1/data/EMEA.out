&quot; the present document is a summary of the European public transportation report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) has judged the conducted studies in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
if you need further information on your disease or treatment you need to read the package line ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 m@@ g. of processed tablets ( tablets , which dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and as injec@@ tion@@ ing solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Go@@ ing thinking and speech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and was@@ ps ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic condition , in which patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal atmosphere ) altern@@ ating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat more serious and severe episodes for the treatment of severe to severe episodes , and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past . &quot;
injection solution is used for rapid control of increased disturb@@ ance or behavi@@ oral disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablets in patients who prepar@@ es the swal@@ low of tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who simultaneously occupy other medicines , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be eliminated , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this imp@@ airs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l probably works mainly as &quot; partial ag@@ agonist &quot; for the formula for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l such as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and d@@ op@@ amine , but in smaller measurements when the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters appears to activate the receptor . &quot;
&quot; since D@@ op@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine play a role in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy , the recovery of the symptoms , was examined in three trials over up to a year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of injec@@ tion@@ ing solution was compared to 8@@ 05 patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or similar diseases resulting in increased turbul@@ ence , compared to a placebo period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in a further study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 347 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy , compared to 160 patients . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which compared to increased disturb@@ ances , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the patient &apos;s change was examined using a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients receiving on treatment . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to set up ( up ) . &quot;
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than those who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in application for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to 74 weeks , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented previously more effective than placebo which was previously treated to re @-@ occur episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses , Abi@@ li@@ fy injec@@ tions were also more effective than placebo perceived their symptoms and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ ts ( sever@@ ity ) , headache , bl@@ ur@@ red vision ( increased storage ) , memory hyper@@ secre@@ tion ( sever@@ ity ) , fatigue and exhau@@ st@@ ion , rest@@ less@@ ness , in@@ som@@ ites ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and medium @-@ serious episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who were mainly man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the result that the advantages of injec@@ tion@@ ing solution in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an oral therapy is not suitable , opposite risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission granted the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd . a permit to take on the Office of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the bi@@ polar disorder and to the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had mostly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day , ir@@ respective of meals . &quot;
&quot; an increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected , although single patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg , once a day , ir@@ respective of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients has not been detected for over 65 years .
&quot; with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify that ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induction is removed from combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
results of a epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased su@@ ici@@ dal risk involving Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l were compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ emia , heart failure , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sc@@ ans , should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or reduce the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a m@@ ns , or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifest@@ ation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , must be set . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l should be applied in patients with sei@@ zu@@ res in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in conditions that arise with cr@@ ushing defeat . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in patients associated with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , in one of these studies , a study with fi@@ xer met@@ ering , a significant relationship between dosage and response to un@@ wanted zer@@ rov@@ ascular events in treated patients with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ u or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients receiving atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ ph@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in general , a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , and lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effects of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advis@@ able if Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ zo@@ l is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with such side effects such as seals ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the re@@ tention rate of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other high @-@ effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and ox@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dos@@ ing reductions . &quot;
&quot; when CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites can result in higher plasma concentration of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefit should overwhel@@ m the potential risks for patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and that &apos;s why similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ing level before the start of the supporting therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the sub@@ str@@ ates of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( Dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ method@@ ology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ tic@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
&quot; due to in@@ adequate data security in humans and due to which in the reproductive studies in the animal case , this drug may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against , dangerous machinery , including power vehicles , to operate until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side @-@ listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; sch@@ izophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , a total of less incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ c@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ is@@ ie , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared with patients who were treated with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study period over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were enrolled in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled study period over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % was treated in patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients under Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol treatment .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS is 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated patients with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; effects of adverse events that may occur in relation to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above their occurr@@ ence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ otic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zu@@ res , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , un@@ intenti@@ onal or intenti@@ onal over@@ do@@ si@@ fications with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l have observed only in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sequence . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ; however , it is unlikely to have hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an overdose , since Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l has a high plasma connection . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a high aff@@ inity to D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and D3 @-@ receptor and to ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as an excessive aff@@ inity to the D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 4 and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 - to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 - to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 - to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7 - to the ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - and to the ser@@ oton@@ in .
&quot; with the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in dos@@ ages of 0.5 to 30 mg once a day over 2 weeks of healthy subjects , the Pos@@ it@@ ons Emission Tom@@ ography showed a dos@@ is@@ dependent reduction of the binding of 11@@ C @-@ rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , a D2 / D3 receptor lig@@ ands , on Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on Putin &apos;s name . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to placebo . &quot;
in week 52 the proportion of patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups .
&quot; current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ gom@@ ery A@@ berg@@ - Depression Invent@@ ory Scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo survi@@ ving efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a over placebo survi@@ ving efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect that was comparable to the basis of lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l also showed a comparable percentage of patients with symp@@ tom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ie to like lithium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol in week 12 .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ian or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially ob@@ tains over 2 weeks not on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy , the supporting therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed up to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se because of the prevention of a re@@ mission in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies the enzymes CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ ation by Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ ation is cataly@@ sed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l using an extensive metabolism of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and nearly 146 hours in &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ ites via CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers and showed no gender @-@ dependent effects during a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation . &quot;
a pop @-@ specific evaluation on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics revealed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in the ethnic origin or the impact of the room to the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic features of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and D@@ eh@@ y@@ dro @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l were similar in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose @-@ study involving subjects with different gra@@ ce@@ ful liver cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ P@@ ug@@ h Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impair@@ ment of liver function on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of class C , which is not enough to pull out shots on their met@@ abolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction x@@ icity , Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and a can@@ o@@ genic potential , the pre @-@ clinical data left no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
&quot; tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when people have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects rec@@ alled by dos@@ ages of dos@@ ing tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment ) for rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the recommended maximum dose for humans ) and an increase of tri@@ ni@@ otic op@@ agus / car@@ cin@@ omes in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the average maximum dose for people ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
&quot; in addition , a Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the failure of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ de metabolism ( AU@@ C ) in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 m@@ g. of the sulph@@ ate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l no more than 6 % of concentrations found in the g@@ all of monkeys are found and are far below the limits ( 6 % ) of the concentrations in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for setting single doses made of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , primarily in prevention of a non @-@ polar recovery . &quot;
&quot; 27 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;

&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l was superior to placebo in relation to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , primarily in the prevention of a flash@@ back in the man@@ ie . &quot;
&quot; 39 Mu@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 46 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to placebo in relation to the prevention of a bi@@ polar return , primarily in the prevention of a non @-@ polar recovery . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day a day ir@@ respective of meals .
patients who have difficulty at the end of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets can be taken to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets as an alternative to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurr@@ ence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective dis@@ ru@@ ptions in some cases , after the beginning or after the change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle ten@@ dity , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) . &quot;
&quot; in general , a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
people should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l
the following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dos@@ ing over 3 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed a placebo survi@@ ving efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partially ob@@ tains over 2 weeks not on lithium or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy , the supporting therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l revealed a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l during a stabil@@ isation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed up to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se because of the prevention of a re@@ mission in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were tested according to dos@@ ages resulting in ex@@ positions of 3- and 11@@ times the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical development . &quot;
patients who have difficulty at the end of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets can be taken to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets as an alternative to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .

&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg , once a day , ir@@ respective of meals as a mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to prevention of recur@@ rent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued at the same dose . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ u or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma , was reported in patients receiving atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk ass@@ essments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia @-@ related un@@ wanted events with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs treated patients who allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) increased the AU@@ C by Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; according to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 can be administered jointly with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ o &apos;s disease . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in sch@@ izophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is communic@@ ated on the combination of a partial agon@@ istic effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study of 3 weeks with fi@@ xer or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to the intake of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l compared to healthy volunteers , the ratio was between the geomet@@ ric c@@ max value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 As a result of the dose of sul@@ fate , sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ates of hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ zo@@ l in the g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) in the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ fold of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11@@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose . &quot;
AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y injection solution is used for rapid control of ag@@ ility and behavior in patients with sch@@ izophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if an oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically attached , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injec@@ tor should be termin@@ ated and with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to minim@@ ize the res@@ or@@ ption and minim@@ ize the vari@@ ability , an injection is recommended in the del@@ e@@ ide@@ us or deep in glut@@ eus @-@ maxim@@ us muscle under revers@@ ing of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
&quot; a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.7 ml ) can be determined depending on the individual clinical status , taking into account the drug or acute or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a secondary treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l is inde@@ xed , see the summary of the features of the drug to AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y tablets , AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y processed tablets or AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y solution . &quot;
there are no tests on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral disorders that were caused by sch@@ izophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; in addition , a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ odi@@ az@@ ep@@ ins are additionally considered necessary for the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution as required , the patient should be observed in regard to extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations to ensure safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or pharmac@@ euticals pois@@ oning ( driven or illegal drugs ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or isch@@ emia , heart failure , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including acute and mal@@ ign@@ ant form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which remained a year or less , there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l in Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifest@@ ations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle stiff , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhyth@@ ms ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ ph@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes mell@@ itus should be monitored regularly in relation to a wor@@ sen@@ ing of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in general , a weight gain is generally known in sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ie , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects and could lead to severe complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , intensity of the se@@ tr@@ ation was larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , in a study , in the healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) as a l@@ ump of in@@ tram@@ us@@ cul@@ ine and who received Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; 105 The H2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ ine , a gast@@ ric acid block@@ ers , reduces the re@@ tention rate of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is regarded as clin@@ ically irrelevant . &quot;
&quot; when using CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; poor &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application of the highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 has resulted in higher plasma concentration of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and H@@ IV@@ - prot@@ ector inhibit@@ ors , might have similar effects and that &apos;s why similar dos@@ ing reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dose of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y should be increased to the dos@@ ing level before the start of the supporting therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular , was the intensity of the se@@ tr@@ ation larger compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
the following side effects occurred in clinical trials with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l injection solution more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than in placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side @-@ listed side effects is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible clinical studies associated with oral Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( * ) as possible ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled study period over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % were enrolled in placebo .
in another study of 12 weeks the incidence of EPS is 26.@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment .
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l treatment and 15.@@ 7 % treated patients with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l and placebo where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in the rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters , yiel@@ ded no medical significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; effects of adverse events that may occur in relation to an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above their occurr@@ ence with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ pt@@ otic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zu@@ res , undes@@ irable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dem@@ entia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes mell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ oral disorders was associated with statistically significantly larger improvements of ag@@ iti@@ vity / behavi@@ ors associated with placebo and was similar to placebo and was similar to Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .
in a placebo @-@ controlled trial period ( 24 h ) with 291 patients with bi@@ polar disorder and ag@@ itation and behavi@@ oral disorders associated with a statistically significant improvement in terms of treatment and behavi@@ oral problems compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm .
&quot; the follow @-@ up improvement from the bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS , Compon@@ ent score at the primary 2 @-@ hour end point was 5.8 for placebo , 9,6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8.7 for Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ itation , a similar efficacy in relation to the overall population was observed , but statistical significance could be determined due to a dimin@@ ished patient count . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) in 1.@@ 228 sch@@ izophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a statistically significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms in comparison to placebo . &quot;
in week 52 the proportion of patients who had a response to study medication was similar in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) .
&quot; current values from measuring scales , defined as secondary studies , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ gom@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg Depression Scale , showed significantly stronger improvement than with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks in stabil@@ ised patients with chronic sch@@ izophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher reduction in response rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ an ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a Ol@@ anz@@ ap@@ in controlled , multin@@ ational double @-@ blind study involved in sch@@ izophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared with the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg ) at an average weight of approx . 5.6 kg . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , which partly over 2 weeks did not react to li@@ thi@@ um@@ - or Val@@ pro@@ at @-@ mon@@ otherapy with a superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study extension for man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l showed up to placebo in regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar rel@@ ap@@ se , primarily in prevention of a re@@ mission in the Man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours , the Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l AU@@ C is the first 2 hours after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of 90 % larger the AU@@ C according to the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two patterns . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time until reaching the maximum plasma scale for 1 to 3 hours . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ o &apos;s injection solution was toler@@ ated by rats and monkeys , and resulted in no direct tox@@ icity of a target organ after repeated treatment for a systematic exposure of 30 mg in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the reproduction x@@ icity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety relevant concerns after maternal exposure that consisted of 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum of human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ v@@ zo@@ l ( oral ) for security har@@ mac@@ ology , tox@@ icity at repeated gift , reproduction x@@ icity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and can@@ o@@ genic potential the pre @-@ clinical data left no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;
tox@@ ic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only with dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions that significantly exceeded the maximum dose or exposure when people have limited or no meaning for clinical use .
the effects rec@@ alled by dos@@ ages of dos@@ ing tox@@ icity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pig@@ ment ) for rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) in female rats at 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10 times the middle ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose when people ) .
&quot; in addition , an Chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was determined as a result of the failure of sul@@ fate con@@ jug@@ ate of hydro@@ xy@@ de metabolism ( AU@@ C ) in the G@@ all of monkeys to repeated oral dose ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 81 times the recommended maximum dose when people based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages which led to ex@@ positions of 3 and 11 times the middle ste@@ ady state of AU@@ C at the recommended clinical dose . &quot;

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study , participated in the 460 women with metastatic breast cancer , of which about three quarters of which had an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effects of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole gift and as a mon@@ otherapy ) was compared to a conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el containing drugs ( given in combination with other medicines for reducing side effects ) .
&quot; in total , 72 ( 31 % ) of 229 with Abra@@ x@@ ane treated patients to the treatment , compared with 37 ( 16 % ) of 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; only the patients who were treated for the first time because of metastatic breast cancer , in terms of progression of the disease and survival did not consider any difference between the pharmac@@ euticals . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer , in terms of these indicators that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied in patients , breast@@ feeding or before the start of the treatment low neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ enz@@ y in the blood . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients , in which the first treatment could no longer suggests , more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ containing medicines must not be given with other drugs to decrease side effects . &quot;
&quot; January 2008 , the European Commission granted the Abra@@ xis Bios@@ ci@@ ence Limited Company granted approval for the placing of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ mon@@ otherapy is inde@@ xed for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with which the first @-@ line therapy for metastatic disease is missing and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ contained therapy is not shown ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with a severe neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of a week or longer ) or severe sens@@ or@@ ical neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in case of sens@@ ory N@@ europ@@ athy grade 3 , treatment is reduced until a improvement in Grade 1 or 2 can be reduced , and with all the following cycles , the dose must be reduced . &quot;
there are currently no sufficient data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
there were no studies involving patients with affected kidney function and there are currently no sufficient data to the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of kidney function ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use with children under the age of 18 , due to non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ question@@ able and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound Nan@@ op@@ artic@@ ulate formula of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , which could contain significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics as other forms of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ( see section 5.1 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should immediately removed and have a symp@@ tom@@ atic treatment , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in the patients there should no longer be led to x@@ ane treatment cycles , until the neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ ology has risen again to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic count rose again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function disorders ( B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while a unique specimen is not detected in relation to cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity , cardi@@ ac incid@@ ents in the indigenous patient colle@@ c@@ tively were not unusual , especially in patients with early anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart disease or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients after the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane nausea , vomiting and diarrhea , these may be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ e@@ tics and con@@ sti@@ p@@ tive means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant or women with age @-@ aged age , which are not effective , except for the treatment of mother with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is un@@ avo@@ id@@ able . &quot;
women in the aged age should be applied during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane a reliable prevention method .
&quot; male patients who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , is advised to bear no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; male patients should be advised before treatment over a sperm level , since the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of an ir@@ reversible in@@ fertility . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane may cause side effects such as fatigue ( very frequent ) and dizziness ( frequently ) that can function on the transport capacity and the ability to serve machines .
&quot; below are the most common and most important incid@@ ents of side effects listed in 229 patients with metastatic breast cancer , which were treated in the pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane . &quot;
Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was the most consp@@ ic@@ uous important hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ( 79 % of patients reported ) and was quickly reversible ; leu@@ k@@ open@@ ia has been reported at 71 % of the patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of the patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
&quot; table 1 , the side effects are listed , which occurred in conjunction with the gift of Abra@@ x@@ ane as a mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lact@@ ation hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosph@@ orus in blood , reduced potassium in blood , reduced potassium in blood canc@@ ers : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sent@@ ag@@ ie , paraly@@ sing , aff@@ ection , dry mouth , loose of g@@ ums , loose chair , ec@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , pain in the under@@ age , spicy pain , re@@ vit@@ ational bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;

&quot; Ru@@ hel@@ o@@ deficiency 1 The prevalence of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction will be calculated based on a defin@@ iti@@ vely , in a population of 7@@ 89 patients . &quot;
&quot; since these events were reported on voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency is possible and there was no conc@@ aten@@ ation related to these events . &quot;
&quot; pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is an anti@@ mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli @-@ drug , which promotes the co@@ lag@@ ging of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli from the tubes and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ uli by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to a inhibit@@ ing of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mi@@ k@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital interest and the otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that Alb@@ um@@ ine is convey@@ ed by plasma components to the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies revealed that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes transport of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el through the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .

&quot; the application of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two un@@ locked un@@ blin@@ ded studies and 4@@ 54 patients , who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III compar@@ ative study . &quot;
&quot; in a study 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of in@@ fusion about 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as in@@ fusion about 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multic@@ enter study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which received every 3 weeks a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el , either in form of sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with preventive medicine ( N = 225 ) or 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without preced@@ ents ( N = 229 ) . &quot;
&quot; when recording in the study , 64 % of patients had an affected general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 met@@ ast@@ as@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; in previously , 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy , 27 % had only adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % of metast@@ asis and 19 % for metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;

&quot; neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity compared with pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el has been evaluated by improving a degree for patients who lived at a time during therapy a peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy grade 3 was evaluated . &quot;
the natural course of peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy to de@@ pot on bas@@ eline due to cum@@ ulative tox@@ icity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses was not evaluated and is still unknown .
&quot; the Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el after 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions from Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 375 mg / m2 was determined in clinical trials . &quot;
the response exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml with a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
&quot; 10 After intraven@@ ous administration of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 , the pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el @-@ plasma concentration took up in multi@@ phase mode . &quot;
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume has a wide @-@ reaching extract and / or female connection of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ quality properties of pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el were compared with intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; the Clear@@ ance of Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el was higher according to the Abra@@ x@@ ane gift ( 43 % ) as a sol@@ vent containing pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el injection , and also the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane higher ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature about in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue stories it reports that Pac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el is in first line to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and for two smaller metabolism ( 3 &quot; -@@ p hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el and 6@@ α -3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ di@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ ax@@ el ) met@@ abolic .

everyone at this study of all patients had been in@@ jected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was in@@ jected in a v@@ ein before they were either pushed to se@@ amed or continued to obtain E@@ pre@@ x / al@@ yp@@ o .
the main indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ations between the onset of the study and the reference period in weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; in addition , the company submitted the results of a study in which the effects of under the skin spec@@ kled Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering from kidney problems caused by kidney problems , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ dings of patients , who were kept on se@@ amed , were calculated in the same degree as in those patients who continued to gain E@@ pre@@ x / al@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , the patients who continued to gain E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o received an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the initial value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of se@@ at@@ oms is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , ech@@ o@@ ing mig@@ raine heada@@ ches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed must not be applied in patients , possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there are no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that for Ab@@ se@@ amed , according to the regulations of the European Union of evidence that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , the Ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information on the medical professionals in all Member States , including information about the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission granted Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co KG . approval for the distribution of Ab@@ se@@ amed within the European Union . &quot;

&quot; treatment should only be carried out in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no Eisen@@ man@@ gel ) , if bleeding measures are not available or in@@ adequate , for planned larger operative interventions ( 4 or more units blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; to reduce foreign bl@@ ut , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure in adults with no iron level , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion comp@@ lications is expected . &quot;

the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) except for p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients where the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation concentration between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.8 m@@ mol / l ) should lie .
&quot; symptoms , gender and total illness can be different depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , assessment of the individual clinical development and disease management is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individuals can occasionally be observed in patients with individual hem@@ og@@ ni@@ otic values above or under the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ di@@ vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose process should be tried to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ bic value is increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month , or if the permanent hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in value is 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) , the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose which is necessary for controlling an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher recovery doses as a patient , in which the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
the present clinical results indicate that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) may need higher recovery doses as a patient where the initial an@@ emia is less difficult ( H@@ b &gt; 6.8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) .
&quot; initial dose 50 i.e. / kg three times a week using intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 kg / kg ( three times a week ) , until the desired destination reach is ( this should be at least 4 weeks in incre@@ ments ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may be different depending on age , gender and total disease burden ; therefore the assessment of the individual clinical development and disease management is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of these hem@@ og@@ lob@@ di@@ vari@@ ability , an appropriate dose process should be tried to achieve hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,2 m@@ mol / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored in order to ensure that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is in the lowest approved dose , which is necessary for checking the symptoms of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 treatment weeks of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ocular value by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sions increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value , the dose should be maintained at 150 i.e. / kg three times a week or 450 kg / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ocular growth &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) and the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ se has risen to &lt; 40,000 cells / µl in comparison to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 times / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after further 4 treatment weeks with 300 i.e. / kg three times a week of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation value ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ dencies increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µl , the dose should be maintained from 300 to / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; against the bas@@ eline value of &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) or the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ sions increased by &lt; 40,000 cells / µl in relation to the output value , a response to the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with slight an@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the car@@ ing deposits of ≥ 4 blood is required , Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 i.e. / kg body weight twice weekly for 3 weeks before the operative procedure . &quot;
&quot; iron sub@@ stitution should be started as early as possible - for example , a few weeks before the start of aut@@ olog@@ ous blood cl@@ ots - started to make large iron reserves before the start of the se@@ at@@ al therapy . &quot;
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the operative procedure and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case , ep@@ ox@@ al@@ fa should pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 i.e. / kg each at 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a f@@ ist@@ el@@ na@@ del , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic recipes to rinse the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients who are ill under the treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine in a ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) , should not receive a se@@ amed or any other Ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stro@@ kes within one month before the treatment , un@@ stable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk for deep ven@@ ous mb@@ osis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ ne@@ tically known ven@@ ous th@@ rom@@ bo@@ hem@@ bo@@ ils ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who are intended to participate in an aut@@ op@@ e@@ dic procedure , which is not involved in an aut@@ op@@ e@@ dic procedure , is the use of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , v@@ ascular disease of kar@@ oti@@ ves or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently entered heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bl@@ ast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported on the occurr@@ ence of an anti @-@ antibodies PR@@ CA after months of long treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
&quot; in patients with sudden labour loss , defined as reduction in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased requirements for non @-@ acid deficiency ( iron , fol@@ aci@@ dic or vitamin B12 deficiency , aluminium , or infections , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ zy@@ ten@@ te is normal , taking into consideration the an@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ ti@@ ku@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes &quot; index &quot; ) , and if no other reason is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin antibody are determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row to diag@@ nose an PR@@ CA . &quot;
data for immun@@ ogen@@ icity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of se@@ at@@ oms in patients with risk @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
8 . patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in section 4.2 the recommended upper limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets .
&quot; in clinical studies , increased mortality risk and risk of severe cardi@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ous events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese stim@@ ulation active ingredients ( ESA ) were given to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mol / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit which is attributable to the gift of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ ine symptoms when the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ation is increased in relation to the control of an@@ ide symptoms and avo@@ idance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions required .
the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mol / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month to minim@@ ize the risk of high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clin@@ evi@@ d@@ entary cor@@ on@@ ary heart failure or storage @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be exceeded in section 4.2 , the lower limit of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in targets . &quot;
&quot; after the time of the detection is not accelerated by the treatment of an@@ emia with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency which are not di@@ aly@@ sis , progression @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency should not be accelerated . &quot;
&quot; in tumour @-@ patient chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa @-@ Gabe and the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin answer should be taken into account ( patients that are possibly transc@@ ended ) . &quot;
if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mol / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.1 m@@ mol / l ) must be adjusted to minim@@ ize the risk of possible thro@@ mb@@ otic events ( see section 4.2 Treatment of Pati@@ ents with chem@@ otherap@@ ist an@@ a@@ emia - Dos@@ age adjustment between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a health risk reduction involving human subjects that should also consider the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients receiving an elec@@ tive orthop@@ e@@ dic procedure , if possible , before the beginning of the ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; patients receiving an indication of an elec@@ tive orthop@@ ae@@ dic procedure should have a reasonable risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in a underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it cannot be excluded that treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa can consist of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of postoperative and vas@@ cul@@ otic events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , it was not proven to improve the overall survival or the risk of tumor cancer with symp@@ tom@@ atic an@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy , if a hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in @-@ target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.7 m@@ mol / l ) was targeted . &quot;
&quot; ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is applied together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , should be controlled by C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and adjusted the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose to increasing hem@@ at@@ oc@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro @-@ vitro , there are no evidence for an interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F regarding hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; m@@ yo@@ car@@ otene , cereb@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , mal@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ots in artificial kidneys was reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , so also patients under ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , reported . &quot;
the most common side effect during treatment with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependent increase of blood pressure or the deteri@@ oration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
increased incidence of rom@@ bo@@ v@@ ascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under the treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
&quot; regardless of the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treatment , it can result in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood don@@ ate to thro@@ mb@@ otic and v@@ ascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically engine@@ ered ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa is gly@@ cine , and in terms of amino acids and carbohydrates , identical with the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , which was isolated from the urine of indigenous patients . &quot;
it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone tumor cells that ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa stimul@@ ates the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese and does not influences the leu@@ cop@@ o@@ ese .

&quot; survival and progression were examined in five major controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were placebo @-@ controlled studies , and &quot;
in the open trial there was no distinction in the overall survival between patients treated with the re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin treated patients and patients .
&quot; in these studies , patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin actually treated patients with an@@ emia due to various frequent mal@@ ign@@ ome consistent , statistically significant higher mortality than in controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ mb@@ osis and related complications with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of th@@ rom@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events with cancer patients who are treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin , and a negative impact on the overall survival can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far this results are applied to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ etin in tumour patient who are treated with chemotherapy with the aim of transfer@@ ring a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ der under 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;
ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life period of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life period of about 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels that can be achieved after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there are no cum@@ ulation : the serum levels remain equal , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well @-@ known compensation of chronic ren@@ al failure in humans and could be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated for three years with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row was treated compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis treatment that were not treated with ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa ( not increased ) . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies with nearly the 20@@ ths of the application of the application of the recommended week@@ ly@@ osis , ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa led to lower body weight , to a delay of the Os@@ si@@ fication and to an increase in mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro findings with cells from human tumor tissue , but for the clinical situation but of uncertain significance . &quot;

&quot; if a larger don@@ tic operation is im@@ min@@ ent , prior to treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed the cause of your an@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ es ( hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive se@@ amed , as an increased risk of blood levels after surgery exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines / apply or used recently , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means to supp@@ ression immune system ) during your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may also arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
laboratory studies have shown no interaction between ep@@ ox@@ et@@ al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F ) for the development of the immune system ( e.g. cancer @-@ chemotherapy or HIV ) .
&quot; depending on how your blood flow ( an@@ a@@ emia ) refers to the treatment , the dose may be adjusted for every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; your doctor will then apply regular blood tests to check and ensure treatment success , ensuring that the medicine works correctly and does not exceed your ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in value . &quot;
&quot; once you are adjusted well , you get regular dos@@ ages of se@@ amed between 25 and 50 i.e. / kg twice a week , spread on two equally large injec@@ tions . &quot;

&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Zom@@ eta , a portion of the data material used for zom@@ eta on the rating of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures were examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study included 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently had suffered a fra@@ cture ; it was investigated the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; in Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies in a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ onate ) . &quot;
&quot; the primary indic@@ ator for the efficacy , whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in the serum ( an enzyme , compound of bone ) decreased in the blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the output value . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of vert@@ eb@@ rates in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis disease ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to placebo for 70 % . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without any other oste@@ opor@@ osis disease ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ tures , 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a had a fra@@ cture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients receiving placebo ( 139 from 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most adverse events of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied to patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate .

&quot; for the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis and oste@@ opor@@ osis in males , a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic fra@@ cture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended two or more weeks after the operational supply of the fra@@ cture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
&quot; after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long @-@ emission period of patients were observed in patients ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ trau@@ matic fra@@ cture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ us@@ cular or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in@@ fusion . &quot;
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a .
&quot; patients with kidney problems ( see section 4.4 ) For patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended , as limited clinical experience for this group of patients are present . &quot;
&quot; older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose @-@ adjustment is not necessary since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination with older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
&quot; children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use with children and adolescents under 18 years , since data is missing for un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) because there are only limited clinical experiences for this patient population .
a pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ene is recommended before the treatment of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with sufficient supplements of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid adjust@@ ing of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , with symp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ ine can develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advis@@ able in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of elem@@ ental calcium for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients who require dental handles , no data are available if the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ onate is reduced to the risk for oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the max@@ im area . &quot;
clinical assessment by the treated doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual health risk assessment .
the incidence of symptoms that occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can be reduced by the gift of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; the incidence of serious adverse events reported cases of bias was increased in patients who received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received placebo ( 0,6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;

kidney function z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic has been associated with kidney problems ( i.e. an increase in serum @-@ creation ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured before administration ) and the occurr@@ ence of kidney failure as well as a reduced kidney function were comparable to oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum @-@ cancer within 10 days was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels were found in 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study to post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures following a hip frac@@ tures and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; in the study on avo@@ idance of clinical frac@@ tures after a recent contamination occurred , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D before administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion interface , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses in the ja@@ w area , mainly in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the ja@@ w area ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ onate , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , were treated . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs for local infection including oste@@ omyel@@ itis , and the majority of reports rel@@ ates to cancer patients based on cancer patients and other dental surgery . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients , oste@@ o@@ ec@@ rose in the max@@ im area with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and treated with placebo in a placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose that leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ ine , it can be reached a compensation with oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glucose . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( PFT ) evaluated the efficacy and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density filter or a BM@@ D @-@ T @-@ Score for the scra@@ pers &lt; -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of existing spine .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a significantly increased over a period of three years as well as after one year the frequency of one or more new vert@@ eb@@ rates ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients of 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of spine compared to placebo ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a &apos;s effect frac@@ tures showed an equal effect over three years , resulting in a reduced risk for fra@@ ct@@ structures resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips , and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; increase in bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.7 % , the total hip is 6.0 % , the scra@@ per cent by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
&quot; bone hist@@ ology At 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , which were treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 70 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) , a year after the third annual dose of bone bi@@ op@@ sies were taken from the pel@@ vic strain . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to placebo , a micro@@ processor @-@ specific analysis ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ ded bone volume and the acquisition of the tra@@ ded bone architecture . &quot;
&quot; bone mar@@ ches The bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of type I@@ - coll@@ agen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were determined in sub @-@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 246 patients in perio@@ dic intervals during studies . &quot;
&quot; treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline value , and was kept at 28 % below the initial value until 36 months . &quot;
&quot; P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months , and was kept under 52 % below the initial value until 36 months . &quot;
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value until 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5.000 , oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; overall , the total post@@ ural trem@@ or was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated with 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) in the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D compared to all time points .
&quot; the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment took over 24 months , compared to placebo treatment to an increase in the BM@@ D by around 5.4 % of the total sales and 4.3 % of the legs . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the Horizon @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized to 508 men , and 185 patients were evaluated according to the BM@@ D after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction of clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical c@@ tures amounted to 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study with men ( study CZ@@ OL@@ 44@@ 6@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , an annual administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was in comparison to the weekly gift of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at relative to the percentage change of the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e @-@ BM@@ D after 24 months in comparison to the initial value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone b@@ ass@@ a was studied in patients and patients at the age of 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed until moderately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the 2.@@ 6@@ fold up to 3,@@ 0@@ fold of age @-@ specific lower normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
&quot; 11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid , compared to taking 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six @-@ month compar@@ ative studies . &quot;
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decline of pain and pain relief was observed after 6 months in comparison to the bas@@ eline value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified at the end of the six @-@ month main study as respon@@ sive ( to the therapy ) were included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; of the 143 patients with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and 107 patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate , the therapeutic approach to 141 of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , compared with 71 of those treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate treated patients , are maintained at a medium length of follow up to 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ one and multi@@ ples of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that are proven to be dos@@ is@@ ir@@ respective . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma process rose rapidly from &lt; 10 % of the maximum value to 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours followed by a long lasting phase , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
fast bi @-@ phase van@@ ished from the large cycle with half @-@ value hours t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours followed by a long elimination phase with a season of Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ am@@ s@@ well@@ time t ½ g 146 hours .
&quot; the early distribution phases ( α and β , with the above @-@ mentioned ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the rapid absorption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tions of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the exposed dose is found in the urine , while the rest is tied to bone tissues . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ cle@@ ance is ir@@ respective of the dose of 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h and remains un@@ affected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ eous acid concentration of 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ federation against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a reduced cle@@ ance by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ enzyme met@@ abolic substances is unlikely to met@@ abolic because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abolic because it is a weak or no ir@@ reversible , fuel @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al cle@@ ance of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ inin Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance , and at the 64 evaluated patients in average 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a regular kidney function until down to a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance to 35 ml / min does not require a dose @-@ adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; because of heavy kidney problems ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , only restricted data are not possible for this population . &quot;
acute tox@@ icity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous dose was 10 mg / kg body weight and rats 0,6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies of dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C provide the 6@@ times of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without ren@@ unci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; chronic chronic and chronic tox@@ icity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was administered to the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in rats , administered as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administered in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure which corresponds to the 7@@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure which corresponds to AU@@ C ) , well toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in long term studies with repeated application of cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions , which exceeded the maximum of the planned human exposure , tox@@ ic@@ ological effects occurred with other organs , including Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract and the liver , as well as the intraven@@ ous injection site . &quot;
&quot; the most common survey in studies with repet@@ itive application was a prolifer@@ ative primary sponsor@@ ing of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with virtually all doses , a survey that reflected the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ res@@ or@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
in rats one observed ter@@ at@@ ogen@@ icity at dos@@ ages of 0.2 mg / kg as external and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ normal@@ ities and such a skel@@ eton .
&quot; in rab@@ bits , no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed , although the maternal tox@@ icity at 0.1 mg / kg was pronounced as a result of serious serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European public transportation report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) is discussed in order to obtain recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric medicine ) is not visible . • It can be applied along with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ ric medicine ( dual therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( particularly overweight patients ) can be applied , which can not be set satisfactory in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin , the present dose of sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ osis or insulin can be retained , except for patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own insulin is better exploited and blood sugar level decreases , making type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1 400 patients , the efficacy of Ac@@ tos in Tri@@ ple@@ otherapy was examined ; patients received a combination of metal form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ osis , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ fied hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a lowering of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which suggests that blood sugar levels were reduced to doses of 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ tion study , the effect of the additional gift from Ac@@ tos to existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ d@@ ant showed in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional gift of placebo led to a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin were examined in 289 patients , the patients receiving an account in addition to insulin , a lowering of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared with 0,@@ 14 % in patients who took placebo in addition . &quot;
the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual problems , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ es@@ thes@@ ia ( reduced sensitivity to friction ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied either in patients who have possibly react sensiti@@ vely to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or any of the other components , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ tic ( high blood sugar level - in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos in the framework of a mon@@ otherapy ( in the sole use ) is to serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with metast@@ ases in patients that met@@ form@@ in is not displayed .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a permit to take account of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , curved and carry on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also indicated for the combination with insulin treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes , whose blood sugar is in@@ adequate and in@@ adequate for contra@@ indications ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients under 18 years of age , there are no data available , so the application is not recommended in this age group . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attacks or symp@@ tom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should start the treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose continuously . &quot;
&quot; patients should focus on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain , or o@@ de@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardi@@ ac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should focus on signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ de@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ economic disease has been carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports of heart failure , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
&quot; in patients with increased output liver impair@@ ment ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standardi@@ zation ) , or with other signs of a liver disease , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used . &quot;
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirrors are increased to 3 times the upper limit of the standard range , the liver rate values are as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed symptoms such as nausea , vomiting , wa@@ it@@ ory disorders , fatigue , loss of appetite , and / or dar@@ ker hard , are the liver values to be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be continued , should be directed to the lab parameters from the clinical assessment . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , a dos@@ ing @-@ dependent weight gain could be detected , which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to a fluid level . &quot;
&quot; as a result of a hem@@ og@@ el@@ ution , a low @-@ level reduction of the average hem@@ og@@ ni@@ otic membrane ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) . &quot;
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled trials involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as oral bi@@ polar or triple combination therapy with insulin therapy or double @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dos@@ ing hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , was reported on a occurr@@ ence or deteri@@ oration of a di@@ ab@@ err@@ atic mac@@ ular de@@ ma with a reduction of visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear whether there is a direct connection between taking the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the occurr@@ ence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ men , but compar@@ ative doctors should be aware of the possibility of a mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients should report on disturb@@ ances of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological declaration should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events , random@@ ized , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the calculated fra@@ cture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years , with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years of women treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; the patients should be aware of the possibility of being a pregnancy , and if a patient wants a pregnancy or enter the treatment ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the investigation of the inter@@ actions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical handling of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; inter@@ actions with medicines that are met@@ abolic by these enzymes , e.g. oral contra@@ cep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( one cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around 3 times .
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in lowering the AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
&quot; this is attributable to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance , and increased the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fossil growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rare &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ f and refra@@ ctive index of lens , as they are observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic drugs . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on AL@@ T approach has three times the upper limit of the standard area are frequently referred to as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ d@@ har@@ n@@ stoff . &quot;
&quot; in an out@@ come study of patients with existing advanced macro@@ economic disease , the incidence of a serious heart failure was below Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on bz@@ an . &quot;
&quot; since its market launch , it has been reported increasingly about heart failure at Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , more frequently when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with insulin or patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summar@@ izing analysis of messages were randomised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in those treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on groups and more than 7,@@ 400 patients in those treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures were treated with 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported peak dose of 120 mg / day over four days , 180 mg / day after seven days had no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator ) Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) which leads to an elevated insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glucose production in the liver and increases the peripher@@ al glucose in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study involving pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy was continued over two years to investigate the time of the therapeutic effectiveness ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the start of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) could be maintained through Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( over 50 % of patients treated with Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was in@@ adequate in spite of insulin @-@ sufficient optim@@ isation phase , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % , compared with the patients who continued to get insulin treatment in the group of insulin treatment in the group of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on cat@@ ches a statistically significant decrease in the alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin Qu@@ oti@@ aire compared to the initial values . &quot;
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small scale at 18 weeks on type 2 diabe@@ tic tanks .
&quot; in most clinical studies , compared to placebo , a reduction of the plasma tri@@ glyceri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase of HD@@ L@@ - Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel and slightly increased , but clin@@ ically significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the total pl@@ as@@ mat@@ ri@@ glyceri@@ des and the free fatty acids , and increased the HD@@ L Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo was found no statistically significant increase in L@@ DL Chol@@ ester@@ insp@@ iegel , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study of over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ erior margin of tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , both of a effect on the tri@@ glyceri@@ de absorption than also on the mental tri@@ glyceri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ Active trial , a cardiovascular disease study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes mell@@ itus and existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cul@@ ine disease were random@@ ized to receive either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , where top concentr@@ ations on un@@ changeable Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is usually reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of the efficacy of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not have any relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical handling of dig@@ oxin , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ pro@@ cou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with fibro@@ sis ( one cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) and lowers the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; following or@@ ical use of radioactive , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on for humans , the marker is mainly found in the subjects ( 55 % ) and to a less@@ er extent in the resin ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period of un@@ altered Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours and the total active met@@ abolic rate is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma concentration of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function lower than in healthy volunteers , but the rates of oral cle@@ ance of the parent &apos;s substance is similar . &quot;
&quot; in tox@@ ic@@ ological studies in mice , rats , dogs and monkey equal to repeated plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ og@@ el@@ ution , an@@ a@@ emia and reversible ec@@ cent@@ ric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributable to the treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which reduces hyper@@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance to the mother@@ ly sub@@ str@@ ates , which reduces the availability of met@@ abolic sub@@ str@@ ates for fossil growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induced by hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( in male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ure@@ tic epithel@@ ium cells .
&quot; in a animal model of a family aden@@ om@@ at@@ ous poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ din@@ di@@ ons led to an elevated frequency of piston . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the calculated fra@@ cture incidence amounted to 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years , with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on women and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years of women treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures stood at 44 / 870 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 fra@@ ctions per 100 patient years ) with patients who were treated with compar@@ ative medication . &quot;
in a further study about two years the effects of combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
&quot; in clinical studies over 1 year , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ inin Qu@@ oti@@ ations in comparison to the initial values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on did not only reduce the sober tri@@ glyceri@@ de , but also improved the post@@ erior margin of tri@@ glyceri@@ de levels , this effect of a effect on the Tr@@ y@@ glyceri@@ de absorption than also on the tr@@ end@@ ental Tr@@ y@@ gli@@ z@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study was missing the goal of their primary end@@ point , who presented a combination of the overall mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , stroke , acute corpor@@ at@@ ar@@ cs and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that with the in@@ gest@@ ion of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no carcin@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ari@@ zation risks are connected . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whit@@ ish , round , flat and carry on one side the mark &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; ACT@@ OS . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summar@@ izing analysis of messages un@@ wanted events , random@@ ized , randomised , double @-@ blind clinical trials have been treated over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients that were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and showed an increased incidence of bone breaks in women . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was born in a total of 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where pancre@@ as can not produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cem@@ y@@ li@@ zed ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which suggests that blood sugar levels were similar to a different human@@ ist . &quot;
Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who possibly react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , acet@@ yl@@ ane doses must be adjusted , if it is given together with a number of other medicines that can be found on blood sugar ( the full list is to take part in the package ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane was overweight in the treatment of diabetes against the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission granted the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S on behalf of Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily , if a fast initi@@ ale effect is desired with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
injection no@@ bility must be ventil@@ ated for at least 6 seconds below skin to ensure that the whole dose was in@@ jected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar , for example , has significantly improved through an intensive insulin therapy , can be perceived by hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin @-@ type ( fast acting , bi@@ phase , long acting insulin etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin or insulin analogue ) and / or manufacturing method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA compared to insulin @-@ animal origin ) may result in a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if changing to Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , dose adjustments can be required , this may be necessary for the first dose or in the first weeks or months after changing . &quot;
&quot; some patients suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or unlike in its previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; prior to traveling , taking over several time zones , the patient should be pointed out to take the advice of his physician , as such trips can cause insulin and meals to other times have to be taken or taken . &quot;
&quot; the doctor must therefore consider possible inter@@ actions in therapy , and they always ask patient to other drugs . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia can develop continuously : • hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia could be treated by the oral intake of glucose or glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should always be treated with glucose , sweets , biscuits or sugar @-@ juice fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ ures with loss of consciousness are treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) , or by glucose , the intraven@@ ous was given through the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum number is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total time is up to 24 hours . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption The reset profile is justified in the product to create a mixture of insulin products with faster or delayed res@@ or@@ ption .
a range of acquis@@ itions ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human @-@ insulin molecule were drawn into consideration ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split @-@ formed metabolism is active .

Aden@@ ur@@ ic is applied in patients who have already demonstrate signs of cryst@@ alline deposits including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or pois@@ oned notes ( &quot; stones &quot; that can lead to joint and bone damage ) .
&quot; if the ur@@ inary layer occurs after two to four weeks still over 6 mg per ann@@ il@@ on@@ ite , the dose may be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , pois@@ oning cases can still occur ; therefore it is recommended that patients intake at least during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic still further medicines for the prevention of pois@@ oning cases . &quot;
&quot; the medicine is not recommended in children and patients who had transpl@@ antation , since it was not investigated for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , in which 1 0@@ 72 patients participated , the effectiveness of three aden@@ ur@@ ic doses ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( pseu@@ drug treatment ) and of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( other medicines for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied once a dose of 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ inary concentration in the blood was at 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of the patients who had Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who had a total of 120 mg per day in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , this was 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and not the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , diarrhea , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with heart failure in the history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the conclusion of the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in the blood of the urine process in the blood more effective than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects in connection with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ an@@ emia in diseases which have already led to urine deposits ( including one from the nurse ) , or currently available gyp@@ sum , and / or gyp@@ sum arthritis . &quot;
&quot; after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose of serum can still be considered to be considered to be considered a dose of dose to AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg / l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) for 2 @-@ 4 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney problems , the efficacy and security date have not been completely examined ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- cle@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents like there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
organ@@ transpl@@ ant receiver since there are no experiences yet with organ transpl@@ ants . the application of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at is not recommended in this patient group ( see section 5.1 ) .

liver disease During clinical trials of phase 3 were observed slightly ab@@ normal@@ ities of the liver &apos;s dys@@ functional patients ( 3.5 % ) .
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver test test prior to the beginning of the Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment ( see section 5.1 ) .
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line Z@@ was not performed any AC studies to Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ ast@@ ar but it is known that the X@@ O in@@ hibition can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a in@@ hibition of the met@@ abolic of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ or ) .
&quot; subjects were associated with the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ag@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 times daily with an increase in the Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ stat@@ exposition ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors were not related to any significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in , without a dose adaptation for Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or the same ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in a study conducted with test subjects , 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in AU@@ C by Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ strate , a CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme to the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a Ant@@ azi@@ d@@ um , the magnesium hydro@@ xide and aluminum hydro@@ xide , ret@@ arded the recording of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ um ( around 1 hour ) , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ on@@ ated pregn@@ an@@ cies may not include side effects of Feb@@ u@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
animal experimental studies do not leave any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful in the tax of a vehicle , serving machines or in practice of dangerous activities until they can be certain that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC can not be toler@@ ated its performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of incidence of cardiovascular disease was observed in the overall f@@ eb@@ radi@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.7 events per 100 patient years ) , although no statistically significant differences were found and no visible connection with Feb@@ om@@ ost@@ at could be found . &quot;
the risk factors involved in these patients were an arter@@ i@@ os@@ cler@@ otic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction or a de@@ comp@@ assed heart failure in the patient &apos;s history .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 up to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects that occurred in the treatment groups of 80 mg / 120 mg of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at and the ( test @-@ rating evaluation ) could be reported in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rhoea , nausea and vomiting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , no severe skin rash or serious damage reaction were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 open @-@ term extension studies in the open @-@ term extension studies were treated 906 for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years and 53 patients with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events reported during the long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those that were reported in the study phase 3 ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ static treatment groups , and occurred among patients , the Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an extended period of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the data occasionally . &quot;

clinical study results of the efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC was shown in two p@@ iv@@ ot@@ al@@ studies in phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) that were carried out with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out .
&quot; the primary efficacy point was in each study of the patients , in which the last three month of certain serum levels of serum levels &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) were reported . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x per day ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 258 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a serum @-@ incre@@ ment value to study start of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed a statistically significant prevalence of oxygen levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) ( see Table 2 and Figure 1 ) and with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
&quot; with regard to the permanent reduction in serum levels below 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ n@@ mol / l ) , the F@@ ACT study showed statistically significant su@@ peri@@ ority in both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg . &quot;
patients with serum samples were treated with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 509 ) were conden@@ sed for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the serum levels , the decrease of the serum levels of &lt; 6,0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mol / l ) was observed in the physician &apos;s visit to week 2 and kept permanently above all the treatment . &quot;
509 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum samples &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function , the AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with kidney problems ( d. h ) . &quot;
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC , the primary efficacy point at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x per day ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 times daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x per day ) of patients . &quot;
there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum levels of serum patients ( 58 % in the group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with heavy kidney problems ) .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ aci@@ dic concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ ACT study ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in two years from the open extension study of the phase 3 showed that less than 3 % of patients needed to decrease intra@@ ocular pressure levels in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients needed no treatment against a pois@@ oning ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the defect size , resulting in 54 % of patients who had a complete disappearance of gyp@@ sum up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.8 % ) in the open @-@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the plasma concentration period ( AU@@ C ) of Feb@@ . ost@@ at after administration easier and multi@@ pler doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional . &quot;
&quot; for cans between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed , which is greater than a dos@@ is@@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking a simple or multi@@ pl@@ oral dos@@ ages of 80 and 120 mg , the C@@ max amounts to 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µg / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µg / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage of the serum concentration of the serum concentration ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ SS / F ) of Feb@@ . ost@@ at is ranging from 29 to 75 litres to take doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma connection of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.2 % ( primary binding to Alb@@ an@@ in ) and is above the concentration of concentration , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies with human liver micro@@ som@@ ites , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are formed predominantly through CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 or CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 9 , and that Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ static cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ edly Feb@@ ag@@ ost@@ at found about 49 % of the dose in the urine as un@@ altered Feb@@ . ( 3 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ otype metabolism and their con@@ jug@@ ate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown met@@ abolic ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ex@@ cre@@ tions about the urine , about 45 % of the dose were in the chair as un@@ altered Feb@@ .

&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ max of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at did not change in relation to test subjects with normal kidney function . &quot;
&quot; the average total @-@ AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at increased by about 1.8 times to 7.5 μ@@ g / ml in the group with normal kidney function to 13,@@ 2 μ@@ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function . &quot;

&quot; age There were no significant changes in regard to AU@@ C of Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at or its metabol@@ ites according to multiple sclerosis oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects . &quot;
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , impair@@ ment of Fer@@ til@@ ity In male rats a statistically significant increase of ureth@@ ra tum@@ ors ( trans@@ itional cell pap@@ ill@@ ary and carcin@@ oma ) were found only in connection with x@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dosed Group , with about 11 times the exposure of people . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specialized Pur@@ in@@ met@@ abolic and urine composition and considered not relevant to clinical use .
it was found that Feb@@ ux@@ e@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day have no effect on fertili@@ zation and reproductive power of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 4.@@ 3 times of human therap@@ ist exposure , maternal tox@@ icity occurred , which entered into rats with a lowering of the performance and development of development in rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in supporting rats with ex@@ positions that were approximately the 4.3 times as well as in tra@@ verse rab@@ bits , with ex@@ positions that were about 13 times the human therap@@ ist , showed no ter@@ at@@ ogenic effects . &quot;

&quot; the holder of approval for the distribution has to ensure that a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ance system is described as in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , ready before the medicine is brought to transport , and so long is how the medicine is brought to transport . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline , a updated R@@ MP grants to risk management systems with the next perio@@ dic Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease , in which the bones are bre@@ wed ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk of low vitamin D mirrors . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or intake of other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitality supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient must not be taken until after the first food intake of the day , the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at and vitamin D3 are already used separately in pharmac@@ euticals , which are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to demonstrate the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing the vitamin D mirror . &quot;
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels were treated with the patients who had been treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who only had al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at income ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company also submitted data that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dose contained in the AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose is equivalent to the dose that is needed for preventing a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of motion ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as stomach pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ her ( ul@@ atory disorders ) , ul@@ cers , diar@@ rhoea ( ul@@ cer@@ ation ) , sli@@ p@@ tive abdom@@ en ( blin@@ dness ) and aci@@ dic heating . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against aging , vitamin D3 or one of the other components may not be applied to AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in diseases of the o@@ es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with Hy@@ po@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or patients who can &apos;t stand upright or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first food , drink or taking drugs ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitality supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following references are closely follow to decrease the risk of ös@@ s @-@ ha@@ ge@@ es and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swallowed after the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not che@@ w the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a consists of . • The patients should not be taken prior to taking the tablet in the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;

&quot; O@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ itis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cers , rarely followed by ös@@ s @-@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ ans , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at ( some were these severe and required a hospital instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore refer attention to all signs and symptoms that are pointed out to possible outcomes , and the patients are to be noted in the occurr@@ ence of symptoms or retro@@ spec@@ ern@@ al pain or a new or res@@ oun@@ ding pain , or to obtain medical advice ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of serious adverse reactions seems to be increased in patients that the medicine does not take correctly , and / or after the occurr@@ ence of symptoms that indicate a ös@@ s @-@ ha@@ ired irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dos@@ ing transfers are carried out in the patient and understood from the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; whereas in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at no increased risk was detected , rarely ( according to market introduction ) Mag@@ ical and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ a , including some severe and complications , reported ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether the removal of a bis@@ phosph@@ onate therapy in patients who require a kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , reduces the risk of oste@@ opor@@ osis of the ja@@ w . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the treated physician is significant for the treatment planning in each patient based on an individual health risk assessment .
&quot; patients should benefit from taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE dose the tablet to the next morning , after having noticed their failure . &quot;
&quot; they should not take two tablets in the same day , but taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases affecting the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ o@@ i@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE from the start of treatment .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at food and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines can affect the res@@ or@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at if they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not conducted , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was taken together in clinical trials with a variety of usually poll@@ uted medicines , without affecting clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for use in post @-@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore neither during pregnancy nor of lact@@ ating women .

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is administered to adult patients , having transpl@@ an@@ ted a kidney or liver to prevent transpl@@ antation of transpl@@ an@@ ted organ by the immune system . &quot;
&quot; as T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously done studies with pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial of 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ antation were presented , the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with pro@@ gra@@ ft / pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients , in which the transpl@@ ant was reduced by a year after a treatment duration of one year ( by example , a renewed organ transpl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more recent studies on 119 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ antation were performed and examined how ad@@ vag@@ raf compared to pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gra@@ ft is absorbed by the body . &quot;
&quot; Tre@@ ats ( trem@@ ors ) , headache , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea ( diar@@ rhoea ) , kidney problems , increased blood sugar levels ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) , hypertension ( hypertension ) and insom@@ nia ( In@@ som@@ never ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity ( allergy ) against T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied to Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; patients and doctors must be careful if others ( especially some vegetable ) medicines are taken at the same time with ad@@ vag@@ raf , as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf dose , or the dose of the appropriate medication may be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ant yellow @-@ orange Jel@@ ly Islands , printed in red ink on the light yellow capsule holder with &quot; 0.5 mg &quot; and on the orange cap@@ sul@@ ated part with &quot; &quot; 6@@ 47 &quot; ; they contain white powder . &quot;
&quot; only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ ul@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ants , should classi@@ fy this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ stress @-@ intensive therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to clin@@ ically van@@ ishing differences in systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transpl@@ ant@@ ments or increased incidence of adverse events , including under@@ - or over@@ immune supp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be maintained ; settings of formulation or regim@@ es should only be made under the under@@ mine control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of transition to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic medication monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us remains . &quot;
the dos@@ ing of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should be primarily based on clinical assessment of decl@@ ining and toler@@ ability in individual case and blood @-@ level regulations ( see below )
&quot; after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f to ad@@ vag@@ raf , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley level should be controlled before conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposition was measured as a talk mirror , both with either kidney or kidney transpl@@ an@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us valley mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation under Ad@@ vag@@ raf to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate stage @-@ transpl@@ ant phase .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low cle@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can take several days until the Ste@@ ady state reaches . &quot;
&quot; in case of the patient &apos;s state in the first post @-@ operative phase , the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate on the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution ) can be initiated using a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application for the supp@@ ression of gra@@ ft reactions must be maintained , therefore , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
&quot; dose recommendations - kidney transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis for transpl@@ antation , the oral Ad@@ vag@@ raf therapy should begin with 0,@@ 20 - 0,@@ 30 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning . &quot;
further dose adjustments can be required later as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after transpl@@ antation .
dose recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ ant chromium @-@ transpl@@ ant therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as once daily gift in the morning .
&quot; Dos@@ age recommendation - conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f on Ad@@ vag@@ raf must have been changed to a daily dose of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules twice daily intake , thus , this change@@ over in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the whole daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transpl@@ ant after a change of other immun@@ os@@ ci@@ res@@ si@@ va on Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily needs the treatment with the treatment of transpl@@ antation and liver transpl@@ ant dose for proph@@ yla@@ xis for proph@@ yla@@ xis .
&quot; cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ant in adult patients , which are turned on Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day to be taken once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other gra@@ ft reactions were probably no clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in lung , pan@@ kre@@ as@@ - and dar@@ ing transpl@@ an@@ ted patients in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 to 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day and in intestinal transpl@@ ants in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adjustments in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function patients with reduced blood levels in the targeted range can be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function While the kidney function is no influence on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dose adaptation is not required . &quot;
&quot; due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potenti@@ als of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular determination of serum samples , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ om and surveillance of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
&quot; conversion of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf In case of switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ ter to a T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is caution ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
recommendations to Tal@@ king levels in full bl@@ ut . dosage should be based primarily on clinical assessment of imp@@ lications and compatibility in single @-@ blood @-@ T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us @-@ tal@@ k@@ ic controls .
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us tal@@ es during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by perio@@ dic controls during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ valley of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after conversion from pro@@ gra@@ f on ad@@ vag@@ inas , dose adaptation , changes to immun@@ os@@ ul@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous use of substances that could change the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood concentration ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf is a drug with a low cle@@ ance , custom@@ iz@@ ations of dose may require several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
clinical studies show that a successful treatment in most cases is possible when the water level exceeds the blood of 20 ng / ml .
in clinical practice the valley mirror of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us usually lie in the first time after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ations usually in the range of 5 - 20 ng / ml and a heart @-@ transpl@@ ant patient at 10 - 20 ng / ml .
&quot; during subsequent detection of liver , kidney , cardi@@ ac transpl@@ ants , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 ng / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to severe adverse events , including transpl@@ ant@@ ments or other side effects , which can appear in a sequence of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Under@@ - or Ex@@ pos@@ ure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage should be maintained ; settings of formulation or regim@@ es should only be made under the under@@ mine control of an experienced medical device ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with transpl@@ antation , which was proven to other immun@@ os@@ ci@@ res@@ si@@ va than therapies , there are no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation . &quot;
proph@@ yla@@ xis of transpl@@ ant @-@ transpl@@ ants in adult heart transpl@@ ants and transpl@@ ants in childhood are still no clinical data for ret@@ ard@@ ent formulation .
&quot; due to possible inter@@ actions , which can lead to a lowering of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of vegetable intake , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) , can be avoided , or other plant extracts during a treatment with additives ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients with diar@@ rhoea is a particularly careful monitoring of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us concentrations in the blood as the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels should be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances .
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f there was a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called chamber or sept@@ um@@ hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders , are already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hypertension , kidney or liver function , infections , liquid load and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ mot@@ si@@ va , the influence of sunlight or UV light should be restricted because of the potential risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes due to appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection . &quot;
&quot; when patients who pose T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , Sy@@ mptoms for Pre@@ s like heada@@ ches , changing levels of consciousness , sei@@ zu@@ res and vision disorders should show a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ inas hard capsules , ret@@ ard@@ ants , lact@@ ose , lact@@ ose , lact@@ ose @-@ int@@ oler@@ ance , lact@@ ase deficiency , or glucose g@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption are necessary . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal medic@@ inal agents , which are known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and thus reducing the blood values of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended to monitor the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us blood levels with simultaneous gifts of substances that can alter the CY@@ P@@ 3A metabolism , and to set the T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining equal concentrations accordingly ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a highly distinctive interaction was associated with An@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , Flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and Vor@@ one@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Macro@@ lid antibiot@@ ic ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies revealed that the increase in blood levels mainly from the increased oral bio@@ availability of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ dose pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute degra@@ dation reaction , can increase the concentration of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us in the blood or lower . &quot;
T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us &apos;s metabolism to the metabolism of other medicines T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is known as CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us with medicines that will be met@@ abolic by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 whose metabolism is affected .
&quot; since T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us reduces the cle@@ ance of ster@@ oid @-@ contra@@ cep@@ tive , so that the hormone exposition may increase , is particularly c@@ auti@@ ous in decisions on recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us potentially decrease the cle@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital and phen@@ ols and extend their half @-@ life period .
&quot; results of a low number of investigations into transpl@@ ant spati@@ ality showed no indication that under T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va , an increased risk of un@@ wanted events concerning the course and the result of pregnancy exists . &quot;
&quot; at u@@ ter@@ o exposition , surveillance of the new@@ born is recommended for event@@ ual adverse effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( especially with its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
it is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and an ali@@ br@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) that means :
the tri@@ but@@ ary profile of immun@@ os@@ res@@ si@@ va is often cited because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below are the side effects after its frequency in desc@@ ending order : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , ≤ 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10.000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) . &quot;

cases of BK @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive leu@@ co@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ c@@ res@@ sor therapy , including treatment with ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
it was reported about ben@@ ign or mal@@ icious ne@@ op@@ las@@ mos@@ es including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymph@@ opro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ors associated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high concentration of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plasma proteins can be accepted that T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ able . &quot;
&quot; mode of action and acoustic effects on molecular level , the effects of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us might be medi@@ ated by its ties to a cy@@ tos@@ atic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the cell chamber . &quot;
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhibit@@ ing of sign@@ alling transfer due to T @-@ cell and prevents tran@@ scription of a certain series of lymp@@ ho@@ dg@@ kin Gen@@ es .
&quot; T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us supp@@ resses the activation of the T cells and cells dependent prolifer@@ ation of the B cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g interfer@@ on ) and expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;

&quot; 175 l@@ ung@@ escaped patients , in 4@@ 75 patients who were subjected to a pancre@@ as transpl@@ ant surgery and in 630 cases , after a gut transpl@@ ant , used as a primary immune hospital . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies submitted observations expressed in these studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was applied in liver , kidney , and heart transpl@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; lung transpl@@ antation In an interim report on a recent survey conducted by oral pro@@ gra@@ f was reported over 110 patients , which received either T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 Rand@@ om@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transpl@@ antation , the bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis , is obl@@ iter@@ ate syndrome , was less frequently observed in the first year after transpl@@ antation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rate after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the patients with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients , there was in 2@@ 1.7 % of cases to the emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis , compared to 3@@ 8.0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be converted to T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 0.@@ 02 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were transferred from T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 580 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which there was no acute transpl@@ antation , was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.7 % versus 4@@ 5.8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the l@@ ung@@ escaped patients of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transpl@@ ant 2001 ; 20 : 511 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a study , the incidence of emergence of a bron@@ chi@@ ol@@ itis is obl@@ iter@@ ated syn@@ dro@@ ms in the patients treated with T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us patients . &quot;
&quot; Pan@@ cre@@ ast@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation A multic@@ entr@@ e study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out on 205 patients , which simultaneously received a pancre@@ as and kidney transpl@@ antation , which received a random@@ ized process T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) . &quot;
the oral Initi@@ al Daily ( per Protocol ) of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then reached after reaching the targeted Tal@@ ks of 8 to 15 ng / ml on 5 .
&quot; gut transpl@@ ant published in the published clinical results of a mono@@ cent@@ ric study with oral transpl@@ ant in 155 patients ( 65 only intest@@ ines , 75 liver , and intest@@ ines and 25 multi@@ vis@@ cer@@ al transpl@@ ants ) showed an overall survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for the screening of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infection , bone mark@@ eters , additional gift of the anti @-@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 ant@@ agon@@ ists have lead and added gra@@ ft controls ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 234 : 404 ) . &quot;
&quot; factors such as a low hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit@@ os and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound group of T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us , or a result of treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids are supposed to be responsible for the higher Clear@@ ance payments . &quot;

advance is used to treat and prevention of bleeding in patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII ) .
dosage and frequency of the application must be applied if Adv@@ ate is applied to the treatment of bleeding or the prevention of bleeding in surgical intervention .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency , causing blood cl@@ ots such as blood vessels in joints , muscles , or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is extracted from human plasma , but is produced according to a method which is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was associated to the formation of the human Ger@@ in@@ eration factor VIII .
&quot; adv@@ ates is similar to another in the European Union approved medicine called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , unlike , but it does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was investigated by preventing bleeding and surgical interventions . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ances at the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 510 new blood vessels was awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ates ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are dizziness , headache , Py@@ rex@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; may not be applied to patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against the human cl@@ ot@@ ation factor VIII , mouse , or ham@@ ster protein or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission granted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG to deliver a auth@@ orization for the European Union Congress in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dos@@ ing and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy , after the sever@@ ity of factor VIII @-@ deficiency , according to the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; during the following hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic events , the factor VIII activity should not fall under the specified plasma level ( in % of the norm or i.e. , i.e. , L / dl ) . &quot;
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection all 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repeat until the risk of the patients is over .
&quot; during treatment , it is used to control the required dose and incidence of injec@@ tions an appropriate determination of factor VIII @-@ plasma samples . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VIII , which are different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
&quot; 3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 i.e. by factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days . &quot;
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plasma activity cannot be achieved or if the blood pressure is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out if necessary to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the adoption rate is set to be set after the patients , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known compensation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII : the Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins that were quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da ass@@ ay quanti@@ fied .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related with the extent of exposure to factor VIII , with the risk being dependent on the first 20 Ex@@ positions at the biggest and of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ P ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nesty @-@ known inhibit@@ or , a factor VIII product was observed after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ union of ( lowest ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurr@@ ence of the ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and lact@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who showed un@@ treated patients with previously untreated inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and dizziness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 234 ) ( 234 ) . the unexpected waste of the blood co@@ ag@@ ulation factor VIII @-@ mirror was post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors .
the blood cl@@ ots has been calculated during the whole time and both the factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - mirrors in plasma and the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient values on the 15 @-@ day operating day .
&quot; in clinical studies with A@@ DV@@ ATE to 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient had a low inhibit@@ ors with A@@ DV@@ ATE ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) . &quot;

&quot; in the previously untreated clinical study , the patients treated 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ ATE inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; immune response to the trace of contam@@ inated proteins were analyzed by the investigation of the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; one patient showed both a statistically significant upward trend and a persist@@ ently peak of antibodies against anti @-@ Ch@@ o @-@ cell proteins , otherwise there were no signs or symptoms appearing on an allergic reaction or hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the occurr@@ ence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ oph@@ ile gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cy@@ tes were reported in several repet@@ itive product positions as part of the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the first approval of available data , the CH@@ MP has continued to monitor the benefit risk - deliber@@ ation continues to be positive , but in consideration that the safety profile must be closely monitored by following reasons : &quot;
&quot; the CH@@ MP has therefore agreed on the basis of safety profile of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes a filing of P@@ SU@@ Rs every 6 months , decided that the approval partner should apply for another 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Molecular Limited was officially distributed to the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company assumes its proposal on approval for the distribution of Adv@@ ant@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Women &apos;s Cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the objects ( tissues , which combines other structures in the body , surro@@ unds and leans ) of it . &quot;
&quot; this is a kind of virus , which was genetically modified , that it may carry a gene to the body &apos;s cells . &quot;
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ant@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ ov@@ irus , &quot; which was so changed that no copies of itself will produce and therefore no infection can solve in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ances in the tum@@ ours had to be in@@ jected directly into the tum@@ ors , thereby enabling the normal p@@ 53 protein to form . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein produced by the non @-@ defect in the human body of the p@@ 53 gene , usually contributes to the restore @-@ damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Women &apos;s Cancer with which the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells may continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company submitted data from a study with a patient prior to the Li @-@ Women &apos;s Cancer in the area of the breakdown , bones and brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions , there were still some issues resolved . &quot;
&quot; based on the assessment of the submitted documents , CH@@ MP created a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP opinion , it was not sufficiently demonstrated that the Adv@@ ance of Adv@@ ant@@ ine in Li @-@ Women &apos;s Tum@@ ors brings advantages to the patient . &quot;
&quot; the committee had further concerns relating to the processing of the medicine in the body , the type of administration and security of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that adv@@ ancing may be made in reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in contact with the patient , harmful . &quot;
&quot; the company did not notice the CH@@ MP to know whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently involved in clinical studies or &quot; comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ant@@ in . &quot;
&quot; altered effectiveness &quot; means that the tablets have been merged in such a way , that one of the effective constitu@@ ents immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze is used to treat the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis ( hay fever , caused by allergy to p@@ ollen ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ c@@ tiv@@ al swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents 12 years old , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ aze has twice daily a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the treatment duration should be as short as possible , as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) . &quot;
treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended as the effects of the medicine can be found on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main real measurements were the changes of the s@@ no@@ graphic symptoms that were reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated using a standard sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all the hay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patient , the Aer@@ in@@ aze &apos;s income , over a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % , compared with 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients who have p@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients showed under Aer@@ in@@ aze a reduction of symptoms by 3@@ 7.4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who had dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ aze ( observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart failure ) , de@@ hydr@@ ation , dizziness , fatigue , in@@ som@@ ol@@ ency ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ency ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , insom@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may not be applied to patients who possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin or any of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ er@@ ge active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of aller@@ gies ) are not used . &quot;
&quot; Aer@@ in@@ aze may also not be applied to patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( hypertension ) , heart condition , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ osis ( hyper@@ hypertension ) , or already a hem@@ or@@ rh@@ ag@@ ic stro@@ kes ( caused by a cereb@@ ral rh@@ ag@@ ic stro@@ kes ) . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to deliver a permit for the agency of Aer@@ in@@ aze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , to swal@@ low ( i.e. without them to cr@@ ush or cut down ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze should be applied to children under 12 years due to the absence of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the duration of the application is as short as possible , and should not be continued after the sound of the symptoms . &quot;
it is recommended to limit the duration of application to 10 days since at long @-@ term application the activity of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ he@@ drin can decrease in time .
&quot; after the decline of the swelling of mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es in the upper respiratory tract due to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , the treatment can be continued as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ aze P@@ seu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , this drug is also contra@@ indicated in patients who are treated with a mono@@ amin@@ oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within 2 weeks after the termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ o@@ etic activity of combined use of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin including Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pit@@ in , per@@ go@@ id , di@@ hydro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ gest@@ iv@@ a which have been used as low shaft of Rhin@@ oplast@@ y ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ yl@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , ep@@ he@@ drin , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collection and not submit their data to address the recommended recommendations on dosage .
&quot; safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ ik@@ aze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver function , and the data is not sufficient to address the recommendations to the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment with a hypertension or a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pol@@ lu@@ pul@@ ations , heart rhyth@@ ms , nausea , or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as heada@@ ches or an ampli@@ fication of the headache ) must be removed . &quot;
&quot; treatment of patient groups is advised to be careful : • Pati@@ ents under digital ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ ton@@ ia , patients with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes mell@@ itus , bladder dysfunction or bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ aze has at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests as anti@@ hist@@ amine otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin inter@@ actions and can be reduced to their extent .
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , in which Ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally given , no clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions or changes of the plasma concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were observed . &quot;
&quot; with the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences were detected between the patients with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 not , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drugs CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 does not in@@ hibit and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the ir@@ regul@@ arity of the application of Aer@@ in@@ aze during pregnancy is not assured , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies , however , no increase in frequency of ab@@ normal@@ ities in comparison to the incidence of the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to humans , and for the reason of v@@ ascular characteristics of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , Aer@@ in@@ aze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to a drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport capacity , or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( seal , ap@@ nea , reduced mental attention , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular disease ) and a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation ( insom@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ kking , vul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , measured values , muscle weakness , and increased muscle ten@@ sions , eu@@ ph@@ oria , excitement , respiratory failure , ar@@ rhyth@@ ms , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , pal@@ pit@@ ations , dizziness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ie , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and hyper@@ ton@@ ia or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stim@@ ulation is especially likely in children as well as as@@ trop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( oral dr@@ y@@ ness , pupils , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; this exclu@@ de the in@@ hibition of rele@@ asing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human ma@@ st@@ ine cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the Ad@@ mire of P @-@ S@@ elec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dose of adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of air performance including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective pun@@ ctual or tasks that are connected with flying . &quot;
clinical trials was observed at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no higher frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin in the recommended dosage may cause additional person@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifest@@ ations of a CN@@ S exc@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; 1,@@ 248 patients participated in the age between 12 and 78 years with seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving Aer@@ in@@ aze Tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , hist@@ am@@ ant efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ aze pills was measured using the overall co@@ res for symp@@ tom ( except nas@@ al mu@@ cu@@ it@@ s@@ well@@ ung ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze pills in regard to the swelling effects , determined using the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a well@@ being , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ aze Tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age , or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is det@@ ach@@ able within 30 minutes after administration in plasma . &quot;
&quot; following the per@@ oral application of Aer@@ in@@ aze with healthy volunteers over 14 days , the flow weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ dr@@ ine was reached in day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dos@@ is@@ study , which was carried out with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult subjects , was found that four subjects were des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine badly . &quot;
&quot; a component interaction study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin , was to the exposition to the gift of an Aer@@ in@@ aze tablet . &quot;
&quot; based on the conventional studies on Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repeated gift , for gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine do not have a special threat to human beings . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no larger tox@@ icity as its individual components , and the effects were generally related to the ingredient pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin . &quot;
in reproductive studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adin / pseu@@ do@@ ep@@ he@@ drin was in the oral gift of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day not ter@@ at@@ ogenic .

&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was studied in a total of eight studies with about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rhin@@ itis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ itis and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by the change in symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of quad@@ ru@@ d@@ les , impair@@ ment of sleep and efficiency on the day ) and after six weeks treatment was determined . &quot;
&quot; further studies were presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and application in children un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rhin@@ itis , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg of A@@ eri@@ us to an average decrease of symp@@ tom score ( symptoms of symptoms ) by 25 to 26 % , compared to the decline of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria , the acceptance of symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared with 40 and 33 % in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied to patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission granted SP Europe to deliver a permit for the European Union on European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once daily , with one or without a meal , for reducing the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ itis ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical trials to efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adolescents 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
treatment of inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be termin@@ ated according to previous illness and can be resum@@ ed after the sound of symptoms and may be resum@@ ed again .
&quot; in the persistent allergic rhin@@ itis ( symptoms of symptoms of 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) , patients can be recommended in constant treatment during the everyday life period . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine tablets containing ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol increases the most powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should however be clari@@ fied , however , that it may occur in very rare cases to be drow@@ sin@@ ess , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of transport capacity or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more side effects were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , oral dr@@ y@@ ness ( 0.8 % ) and heada@@ ches ( 0.6 % ) were reported on most common side effects , which was more common than placebo . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study with 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years was the most common adverse effect of heada@@ ches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and 6.9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose trial , in which up to 45 mg des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( Ne@@ un@@ fold clinical dose ) were administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of rele@@ asing the release of pro@@ inflammatory cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 of human ma@@ st@@ ine cells / Bas@@ op@@ hil@@ en as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the Ad@@ mire of P @-@ S@@ elec@@ tin to end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multi @-@ outlets , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. daily , no statistically significant or clinical @-@ relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ e@@ times of clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single dos@@ ing study , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of air performance including ampli@@ fying sub@@ jective pun@@ ctual or tasks that are linked to flying . &quot;
&quot; patients with allergic rhin@@ itis was A@@ eri@@ us effective in reducing the symptoms such as ni@@ es , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seasonal and per@@ ennial , allergic rhin@@ itis can be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis and persistent allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
per@@ si@@ zing allergic rhin@@ itis is defined as the onset of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown in the total co@@ res of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ is , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden of seasonal rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , representing additional forms of the Ur@@ tik@@ aria , was identified as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , regardless of e@@ ti@@ ology in different forms , and chronic patients can be recru@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine release is a urs@@ or factor in all ur@@ tic@@ ism cases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine is also expected to improve in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria in other forms of Ur@@ tik@@ aria ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and degra@@ dation of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ amine disease in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of the patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ amine were excluded from the study . &quot;
a improvement of the youth inc@@ enti@@ ves by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disturb@@ ance of sleep and grow significantly , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evalu@@ ating this variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , which were comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
there are no reference points for a clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines will not be excluded . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in @-@ vi@@ vo non @-@ CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 product is not in@@ hib@@ its and neither a sub@@ strate nor a inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ one .
&quot; in a single dos@@ is@@ study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fet@@ al , cal@@ orie rich breakfast ) does not refer to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the study carried out by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine conducted research studies , with a compar@@ ative degree of the exposure of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , no qualitative or quantitative differences in terms of tox@@ ic@@ at@@ ad@@ ine and by Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on Safety Pharmac@@ ology , Tox@@ icity at repeated gift , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and reprodu@@ ci@@ icity , the pre @-@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine have no particular dangers for human beings . &quot;

&quot; the physician should be aware that most cases of rhin@@ itis in children under 2 years of age caused by an infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data are prescribed , which support a treatment of infectious rhin@@ itis with A@@ eri@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ic anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis , physical examination , and appropriate laboratory and skin studies should play a role . &quot;
approximately 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of met@@ abolic des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine are restricted and experienced a higher substance load ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ up for children aged between 2 and 11 years , which met@@ abolic met@@ abolic , is identical to the children who met@@ abolic the normal met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ osis and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ ed@@ itary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose int@@ oler@@ ance , glucose @-@ g@@ act@@ ose absorption or suc@@ rose @-@ in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medication should not take this medication . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant inter@@ actions were not detected in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets where ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were added in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in@@ clin@@ ically in@@ gest@@ ed by A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol is not reinforced with the most powerful effect of alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
overall incidence of adverse events in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as compared to the placebo group .
&quot; in clinical studies with adults and adolescents in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ itis and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the recommended dose were 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ service study of adults and adolescents , administered at up to 45 m@@ g. of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( ne@@ e@@ fold clinical dose ) , no clinical relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; children aged between 1 and 11 , who came to a question of anti@@ hist@@ amine treatment , received a daily Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rhin@@ itis / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine may be extra@@ pol@@ ated in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of up to 20 mg daily , no statistically significant or clinical @-@ relevant me@@ ov@@ as@@ cul@@ ine effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine in a dose of 45 mg daily ( the ne@@ e@@ times of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c interval . &quot;
clinical studies have been detected at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents no higher frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo .
&quot; for a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets conducted in adults and adolescents in clinical studies at no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it was not affected by the simultaneous intake of alcohol not to an increase of alcohol induced performance , nor to increasing the drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ itis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reducing the symptoms such as ni@@ es , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of nose , it@@ ching , tear and redness of the eyes and it@@ ching of arms on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the total co@@ res of the questionnaire regarding quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tiv@@ is , A@@ eri@@ us tablets decreased effectively by seasonal allergic rhin@@ itis . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and degra@@ dation of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose . &quot;
&quot; the prolifer@@ ation of this fully met@@ abolic phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Caucas@@ ians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic multi @-@ dose study with sy@@ rup formation in children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ itis , restricted by met@@ abolic . &quot;
&quot; the load ( AU@@ C ) by des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours , and the C@@ max is about 3 to 4 times higher with a season half @-@ time period of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no reference points for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient cum@@ ulation after once daily use of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine ( 5- 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine were comparable in p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric patients with those recommended doses of adults who were des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , however , was not yet identified , so that interaction with other medicines can not be excluded . &quot;

&quot; in June 2008 , Nov@@ art@@ is V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. was officially distributed to the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) , that the company has received its proposal on approval for the placing of A@@ fl@@ in@@ ov to prevent avi@@ al@@ ers H@@ 5@@ N1 influenza in adults and older people . &quot;
A@@ fl@@ in@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against influenza that is caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N1 of the influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine that might cause a strain of flu virus , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; influenza pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can be spread easily by man , because humans still have no immun@@ ity ( not protection ) . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system det@@ ects which contained in the vaccine contained in the vaccine &quot; antibodies &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will be able to form a rapid antibody in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , the membrane gro@@ mm@@ et of the virus was removed with the &quot; &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) , pur@@ ified , and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the volume of clinical data base for the evaluation of the security of the vaccine is not sufficient to meet the requirements of the EMEA for prepar@@ atory vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; should you participate in clinical examination and require further information on your treatment , please contact your doctor &apos;s treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you want more information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are caused by human immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who may not swal@@ low the capsules are available as a solution to set , but this can not be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination was not investigated . &quot;
&quot; a generic term should then be instit@@ uted , if the doctor has examined which an@@ tivir@@ al medicines of the patient had previously taken , and the probability of the virus is to appeal to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , that together with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other an@@ tivir@@ al medication . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of ap@@ points according to body weight . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase has decreased in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines the HIV amount in the blood and holding them on a low level .
&quot; AIDS is unable to cure AIDS , however , the damage of the immune system and thus also use the development of associated infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other an@@ tivir@@ al medicines , but without p@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults , which previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; with low @-@ do@@ si@@ dered kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced drugs , A@@ gener@@ ase was taken with 206 adults who had previously taken prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the primary indic@@ ator for the efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change of viral load after treatment .
&quot; in the studies involving patients who previously had taken no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , after 48 weeks more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml being below placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in the case of children , the viral load was also reduced , however , of the children that previously had been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few on treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study involving adults who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , that was the viral load increased by Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced pharmac@@ us@@ last after 16 weeks of treatment as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with HIV , which was resistant against four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , there was a severe waste of viral load after four weeks , when patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or : &quot;
&quot; the most frequent A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rhoea ( diarrhea ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( blood ) , vomiting , rash and F@@ atigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied in patients , possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) to am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; gener@@ ase must also not be applied in patients , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( a vegetable preparation for the treatment of depression ) or pharmac@@ euticals , which are the same as A@@ gener@@ ase and are taken in high concentrations in blood health harmful . &quot;
&quot; as for other medicines for HIV , patients who are targeted in patients suffering the risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( causes in the distribution of body fat ) , an oste@@ o@@ arthritis ( symptoms of an infection caused by the relaxing immune system ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusion of the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase , in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of Avastin @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the Committee noted that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who previously did not have prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was initially admitted under &quot; exceptional circumstances . &quot; since the time of approval from scientific reasons , only limited information were submitted . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited granted approval for the distribution of ac@@ companies in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1- infected , prot@@ eas@@ ing inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children 4 years old . &quot;
&quot; for usually , A@@ generic capsules are supposed to be administered to the pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic boost of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r together with low dos@@ ages of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r should take place in taking into account of the individual viral resistance and the pre @-@ treatment of patients ( see section 5.1 ) .
the bio availability of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ moun@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r twice daily , together with 100 mg of p@@ am@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of p@@ adding ) , higher doses have to be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; Pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , Eff@@ ic@@ acy and Safety of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use with children under 4 years due to the absence of data to un@@ think@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ er@@ getic data , the dose to A@@ gener@@ ase capsules should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day and in patients with severe liver function disorders at 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of patients with mild or moderate liver function problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; as@@ su@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with medicines that have a low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
&quot; herbal preparations , the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the risk of reduced plasma concentration and a reduced therapeutic effect of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
patients should be noted that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they may also develop opportun@@ ist infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of transfer of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules are supposed to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who suffer from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy , increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially fatal course . &quot;
&quot; for the case of simultaneous an@@ tivir@@ al treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the appropriate information of this drug . &quot;
patients with existing restricted liver function including a chronic hepatitis hepatitis show increased incidence of liver function disorders under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and should be monitored in accordance with clinical practice .
&quot; the simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ ason or other glucose concentrations , which is not recommended , unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic co@@ ster@@ oids , including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and supp@@ ression of the side effects ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
because the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly recommended by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended due to the increased risk of my@@ ths including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis .
&quot; 4 For some medicines that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International Standards ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking these medicines at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase can be less effective because of reduced plasma level of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; because of the possibility of met@@ abolic inter@@ actions with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r may be changing the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium @-@ symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ane content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated with children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution with certain other patient groups . &quot;
as@@ su@@ ase should be set to duration 5 when a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , was reported about the onset of diabetes mell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an existing type of diabetes mell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases to be associated with medication , which are associated with the development of a diabetes mell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; a higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with medication . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ ust@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports are above an increase of bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in the time of the introduction of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) , anti @-@ infected patients can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections , which leads to severe clinical condition or deteri@@ oration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a Multi@@ fac@@ tor@@ ial e@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , severe immun@@ os@@ u@@ pp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ arthritis , in particular in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic lat@@ itude can not be given simultaneously with medication that have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic lat@@ itude A@@ gener@@ a must not be combined with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly connected to CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and are connected to the increased plasma level with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; when attemp@@ ting to compens@@ ate the low pl@@ ough level of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often un@@ wanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous use of plant preparations with Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already typ@@ ed by Johann@@ is@@ erk@@ raut , the Am@@ bul@@ av@@ irus mirror and when possible to verify the viral load and comp@@ ile the Johann@@ is@@ k@@ raut . &quot;
a dose adjustments for one of the medicine is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered together with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ quest@@ ir@@ ence below ) .
&quot; increases 508 % for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r were applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which prove the effectiveness and the in@@ ability of this treatment schem@@ ati@@ as . &quot;
&quot; if Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice a day ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of p@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg , twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , however , it is recommended , however , a tight monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study carried out in combination with di@@ dan in combination with di@@ dan in combination , however , due to the ant@@ acid component of di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , there are at least one hour apart ( see ant@@ acids below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) no dose adjustments are required . &quot;
treatment with E@@ quest@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be ern@@ ed .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or and existing limited data suggest that Ne@@ vi@@ ra@@ pine may possibly lowers the serum concentration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; if this drug should be used simultaneously , caution is advised since Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma . &quot;
&quot; if this drug is used together , caution is provided ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a detailed forecast the effect of the combination of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ d@@ ut@@ in led to a rise in Plas@@ ma@@ concentrate ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ ut@@ in by 193 % , thereby resulting in an increase with Ri@@ ver@@ ut@@ in &apos;s side effects . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , it is necessary to submit Ri@@ d@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase , in at least half of the recommended dose should be taken , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with car@@ ving in combination with ery@@ th@@ rom@@ y@@ cin were not performed , however , the plasma level of both medicines could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day brought to a increase of C@@ max K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole a day , compared to the value that was observed after 200 mg of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ates or induc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can be applied if they are used together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly for inter@@ actions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be monitored on toxic reactions , associated with these drugs , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or , it is advis@@ able that ant@@ acids may not be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase , as it can occur to reset dysfunction . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti@@ con@@ vul@@ va that are known as enzymes in enzymes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r may lead to a lower level of plasma seal . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection , including mort@@ al pension , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily , combined with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ generators with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended together with these glucose concentrations , unless the potential benefit of treatment is the risk of systemic co@@ ster@@ oids ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ ers such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism depends heavily by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , increases the plasma level increases with simultaneous activation of as@@ pi@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; as plasma pressure increases of this H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A reduction inhibit@@ ors to my@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of this medicine is not recommended with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
it is recommended a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations as far as stabili@@ zation of the mirror as the plasma concentration of Cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and T@@ acro@@ lim@@ us may also be increased by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase must not be applied together with oral m@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while maintaining A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ ental Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am caution . &quot;
&quot; data for the simultaneous use of par@@ c@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , indicate a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am around 3 to 4 times . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on op@@ ium @-@ symptoms , especially if there are still low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the minor reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can be given , such as Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r will be given simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous gifts of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards Organization ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contra@@ cep@@ tive is not predic@@ table , therefore alternative methods for contra@@ c@@ eption is recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for the simultaneous gift of as@@ su@@ ase ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be used in the reduction of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk re@@ activated rats , Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r passed into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study on dre@@ ad@@ ful rats that was administered by the ni@@ b@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 12 body weight at night . &quot;
further development of contribution including fertili@@ zation and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r to the parent .
the negli@@ gence of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment , related side effects were slightly rounded up , rose early , and rarely brought to treatment ab@@ rupt@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether in connection with in@@ gest@@ ion or other drugs to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the mentioned side effects come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors did not pre @-@ treated patients 1200 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were assessed by the examination as in connection with study medication , and increased in more than 1 % of patients , as well as under the treatment of inspec@@ tions ( Grade 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy was associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV @-@ patients , including a loss of un@@ stable and fast @-@ fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ y@@ k@@ al fat accumulation ( Sti@@ cking ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ spective , not pre @-@ treated persons treated with Lam@@ ve@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ ph@@ ud@@ in / zi@@ do@@ v@@ ud@@ in over a medium duration of 36 weeks was only a case ( breast@@ feeding ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study included 245 N@@ RT@@ I@@ - pre @-@ treated patients under Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 241 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with different N@@ RT@@ Is over a medium length of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin covers were usually easy to moderately pronounced , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ y nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred spont@@ aneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without leaving the treatment with Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ o@@ arthritis were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of HIV @-@ infected patients with heavy immune system , a anti @-@ inflammatory reaction ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ du@@ ous opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with PI pre @-@ treated patients who received 600 mg of A@@ gener@@ ase twice daily , with low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) , were comparable to patients suffering from tri@@ glyceri@@ de and CP@@ K values , which received patients who received A@@ gener@@ ase , together with low do@@ si@@ dered kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequent . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary to take necessary support measures . &quot;
Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease and prevents the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and g@@ ag pol@@ ari@@ zation with the result of a formation of un@@ ripe , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood vessels . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells .
the link between activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ rep@@ lication on humans are not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tively treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as well as other p@@ avi@@ al@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - the mut@@ ations only rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; at sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti @-@ treated patients receiving 700@@ mg of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , where 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 , with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors not pre @-@ treated patients , showed resistance samples which were similar to adults . &quot;

&quot; in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg to Fos@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred in patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure about 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations , genetic analysis systems can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the present ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance than the presence of the mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ I , I@@ 84@@ I and L@@ 90@@ M , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations of a vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ations pattern can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpretation systems to analyse the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on ph@@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clinical vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates . &quot;
companies to distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( isol@@ ating points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a resistance tests .
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns generates a certain clo@@ ak@@ ence against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , which remains sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but is generally received . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data to cross resistance between Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r resist@@ iv@@ ways , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ spective patients fore@@ seen , a limited cross resistance to At@@ az@@ an@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , indi@@ an avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ fl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ fl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ fl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ fl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ fl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ fl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ zi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ avi@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and am@@ on@@ avi@@
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates ; the receiving of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; early release of a failure therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which may apply to the following treatment . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of as@@ su@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study , in which with PI untreated ( N@@ RT@@ I ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) , with a PI , predominantly with a low @-@ known Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; p@@ oo@@ king &quot; were received . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ sixty ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to aging , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ RT@@ I were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis revealed the non @-@ su@@ peri@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the SO@@ C PI Group compared to the period adjusted average output ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plasma load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ point threshold of 0,4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of un@@ f@@ oo@@ die A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials with a total of 288 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ gener@@ ase has been used to intake and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
there was no low @-@ do@@ si@@ dered kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients with PI previously treated patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ RT@@ Is .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration of &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in case of median increase of CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on these data should be considered at the therapy optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children , to be considered to be expected of &quot; un@@ broken &quot; aging . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average length ( t@@ max ) to the maximum serum concentration of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r is approximately 1 to 2 hours for each capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 508 % increases for C@@ max by 30 % , when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r 12 hours to Dos@@ age ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady state ( C@@ min , ss ) has remained un@@ affected by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake and the rate of res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large distribution volume , as well as an un@@ prevented Pen@@ et@@ ration of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue . &quot;
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the overall concentration of the drug in plasma , where the amount of un@@ bound Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active portion , remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the met@@ ering drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady state in the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medication that are induced or in@@ hib@@ ited CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or be given a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ us@@ avi@@ r exposure like in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r is made of the solution 14 % less bio@@ availability as of the capsules ; therefore A@@ gener@@ ase solution and A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gramm@@ ar basis .
&quot; the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney function should be minimal due to the elimination of am@@ us@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; this treatment schem@@ atics lead to am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r plasma plasma levels comparable to those who are generated in healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r twice a day , without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats appeared in male animals , o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas in doses of dos@@ ages involving the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure of humans , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the asis of o@@ cellular Aden@@ oms and Car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet cleared , and the relevance of this observ@@ ational effects for human beings is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; however , out of the present ex@@ positions data on humans , both in clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , a little hin@@ ts for adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse measurement tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ oma test , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome tests had been detected by human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , am@@ us@@ avi@@ r was still gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; these liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life by AST , AL@@ T and activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , no significant liver tox@@ icity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of ag@@ glomer@@ ates still after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity at young , treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the controls and with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; during a systemic plasma exposure which was significantly higher ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure of therapeutic dosage during humans , however , a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus ong@@ ation and low @-@ level skel@@ eton changes were observed . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are used without the intensi@@ fying addition of p@@ adding ) , higher doses have to be applied ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r , which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use of patients with weak or mild liver function problems with caution , in patients with severe liver function disorder is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some drug that may cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of International Standards ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
as@@ su@@ ase should be set to duration 27 when a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with medication . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increases 508 % for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been achieved twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of p@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg , twice a day ) in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a dosage recommendation for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can &apos;t be given , however , it is recommended , however , a tight monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and un@@ question@@ able this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ quest@@ ir@@ enz in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or would be ern@@ ed .
&quot; if this drug is used together , caution is provided ; a thor@@ ough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be performed as a detailed forecast the effect of the combination of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult to Del@@ av@@ ir@@ din . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons , it is necessary to submit Ri@@ d@@ ut@@ in together with A@@ gener@@ ase , in at least half of the recommended dose is 31 , although there are no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentration of calcium channel block@@ ers such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Isra@@ di@@ pin , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin , N@@ isol@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily , combined with 50 µg Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at int@@ ran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of subjects , while endo@@ genous K@@ ort@@ is@@ ol increased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % interval between 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in simultaneous gifts of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators together with A@@ gener@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International Standards Organization ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak or rein@@ forcement of the anti@@ thro@@ mb@@ otic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg eth@@ in@@ y@@ le@@ stra@@ di@@ ol plus 1.0 mg No@@ re@@ thin@@ dron ) resulted in a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r by 22 % respectively .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful separation of possible use for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fo@@ etus . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study on dre@@ ad@@ ful rats that was administered by the ni@@ b@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during the breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the negli@@ gence of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of an overdose , the patient is to observe signs of an in@@ tox@@ icity ( see section 4.8 ) if necessary , are necessary to take necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the an@@ tivir@@ al activity of Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ bl@@ ast@@ ical cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood vessels . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r is in the range of 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm with chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µg / ml ) .
&quot; vice versa , Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r ret@@ ains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or resistant insul@@ ates ; the receiving of this activity appears to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the therapy optim@@ isation was considered to be considered with PI pre @-@ treated children of the &quot; un@@ ble@@ ating &quot; ash@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during the substance concentrations in the Ste@@ ady state in the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medication that are induced or in@@ hib@@ ited CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , or be given a sub@@ strate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 with caution if they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the ren@@ al cle@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is negli@@ gible ; therefore the effects of a ren@@ al disorder on the elimination of Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be small .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the carcin@@ ogen@@ icity with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r in mice and rats appeared in male animals , o@@ cellular Aden@@ omas in doses of doses of the 2.0 times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - fold ( rat ) of the exposure of people after twice a daily gift of 1200 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanism for the emergence of o@@ dom@@ ular aden@@ oms and Car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet cleared , and the relevance of this observ@@ ational effects for human beings is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; however , out of the present ex@@ positions data on humans , both in clinical trials and therapeutic application , however , a little hin@@ ts for adop@@ ting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity tests , the bacterial reverse measurement tests ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ oma test , micro@@ core test in rats and chromosome tests on human peripher@@ al lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , was am@@ us@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ ations nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies for tox@@ icity at young , treated with an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the controls and with am@@ us@@ avi@@ r animals . &quot;
&quot; these results will make sure that the metabolism of the metabolism are not fully mature , so that Am@@ bel@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z . &quot;
&quot; aging solution to set up is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ eas@@ ing inhibit@@ or ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children 4 years old . &quot;
&quot; the benefits of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ die , &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution to intake was neither with PI previously treated patients with PI pre @-@ treated patients . &quot;
the bio availability of am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than one capsule ; therefore A@@ moun@@ ase capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram base is not inter@@ changeable ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the patients should , as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules , taking the solution to taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2800 mg of Am@@ bu@@ avi@@ r that should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , as a dose recommended for the simultaneous use of a generic aging solution to set up and low do@@ si@@ dered kn@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided , this combination with these patient groups can be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dose @-@ adjustment for am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r is not necessary for am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r , an application of A@@ gener@@ ali@@ r is contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of an toxic response as a result of the high propylene glyco@@ sides , A@@ gener@@ ase solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a qualified inhibit@@ ing of the metabolism of this medicine and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhyth@@ mi@@ as ( z ) .
patients should be noted that aging or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy do not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase prevents the risk of 47 of a transfer of HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood .
&quot; to cause some drug to cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ ar@@ b@@ ital , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ de@@ press@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International Standards ) , are methods to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
generic aging should be removed for duration if a skin rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ c@@ ous membran@@ es ( see section 4.8 ) .
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with pharmac@@ euticals 49 dependent factors such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated met@@ abolic disorders associated with medication . &quot;
&quot; in h@@ ust@@ op@@ hil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports are above an increase of bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ at@@ oms and hem@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; it has been shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C by Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and a resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increases 508 % for C@@ max by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice a day ) in combination with am@@ bo@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous intake with A@@ gener@@ ase can increase their plasma concentration and with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in connection , including mort@@ al pension , bl@@ ur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data about 54 other CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am significantly increased plasma concentration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known as a generic term . A@@ gener@@ ase solution may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of the fo@@ etus to the included propylene glyco@@ l system ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk re@@ activated rats , Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , however , it is not known whether Am@@ bul@@ avi@@ r passed into breast milk . &quot;
&quot; a reproductive study on dre@@ ad@@ ful rats that was administered by the ni@@ b@@ ation in the u@@ terus to the end of the breast@@ feeding Am@@ blo@@ avi@@ r , showed a reduced increase of 55 body weight at night . &quot;
the negli@@ gence of A@@ gener@@ ase was examined in adults and children 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied whether in connection with in@@ gest@@ ion or other drugs to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ spec@@ tively treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as well as other p@@ avi@@ al@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages - the mut@@ ations only rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; early sl@@ ump of a failure 60 therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which may apply to the following treatment . &quot;
&quot; 62 Based on these data should be considered at the therapy optim@@ isation with PI pre @-@ treated children , to be considered as the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ broken &quot; aging . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a weight of 70 kg ) , and lets it close to a large number of Vet@@ rop@@ he@@ avi@@ r from blood circulation into the tissue . &quot;

&quot; to treat patients with Al@@ dar@@ a and the duration of treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a , Al@@ dar@@ a can open up to a maximum of 16 weeks in the genital area . • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , it is for six weeks a week , during one or two weeks of treatment cycles , with four weeks break between treatment cycles , three times a week . &quot;
&quot; the cream has been dil@@ uted before bed@@ time to the affected skin surfaces , so that they remain in@@ sufficient ( about eight hours ) on the skin before being washed out . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( same cream but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four major studies on 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete separation of patients . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also examined in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two trials , in which patients were treated for six weeks or placebo either daily or five times per week . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was the number of patients with complete separation of tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two trials , in two trials , in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than the placebo . • For the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was the full healing rate of 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of both studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete reduction rate of 66 % to 80 % compared with Al@@ dar@@ a patients compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application site of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; non @-@ hyper@@ tro@@ phic not@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( A@@ KS ) in the face or on the scal@@ p of immune system adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions have limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy , or less suitable for other top@@ ical treatment possibilities . &quot;
&quot; open on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is so long to continue until all visible pipes have disappeared in the genital area or peri@@ an@@ al@@ division , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure should be considered to occur when intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when treating an infection .
&quot; if at follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the treated les@@ ions are only completely healed , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose is left out , the patient applied the cream as soon as he / she noticed this and then proceed with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream is thick@@ ened in a thin layer and cut into the pur@@ ified , with gra@@ dients of infected skin area until the cream has completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and with a possible mer@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , a balance between the benefits of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and with a possible organ @-@ shock or Count @-@ versus @-@ host@@ - reaction connected risk . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily Vor@@ ar@@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene has been carried out , two cases of severe Phi@@ mos@@ is and a case was observed with one of the circumcision leading Stri@@ cture . &quot;
&quot; with an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk for heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ation were observed , which required a treatment and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulties with the water that necess@@ itated an emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and a treatment of the affected area required . &quot;
&quot; for use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following a treatment with other cut@@ aneous imp@@ lic@@ ated funds for the treatment of external f@@ eig@@ ners in the genital area and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ area , there are no clinical experiences yet . &quot;
&quot; limited data suggest an increased rate of incl@@ ine reductions in HIV @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream has shown a less effectiveness in this patient group due to the elimination of the gro@@ oves . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , lips or hair attachment was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin inter@@ actions are frequent , but intensity of these reactions take place in general during therapy , or reactions form the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the complaints of the patient or the sever@@ ity of local skin inter@@ actions , a treatment party can be made for several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of therapy can be evaluated according to the regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there are currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after treatment , should be drawn up with super@@ fixed bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical study indicate that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood of the response to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not studied for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ osis on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or ears , or on the Li@@ pp@@ en@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses to anatom@@ ic places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; available data on acute ker@@ at@@ osis to the fore@@ arm and hands support the effectiveness in this use case , therefore , such an application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin inter@@ actions occur frequently , but these reactions usually take away during the therapy to intensity or go back after the treatment of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reaction causes a large dis@@ comfort , or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed to some days . &quot;
&quot; out of the data from an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 files would be a lower total rate of healing than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive a immune system ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fat development , the development or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ painting of the top@@ ical application it has been quanti@@ fi@@ able ( &gt; 5@@ ng / ml ) , no recommendation for use during feeding times are given . &quot;
the most commonly shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the effects of three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the treatment of F@@ eig@@ ni@@ zen ( 3@@ 3.7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) .
&quot; one of the most commonly reported and probably , possibly , with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream in connection @-@ related side effects include complaints at the application location with a frequency of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
&quot; from 185 to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream , Bas@@ ali@@ om patients treated from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III reported side effects are below . &quot;
&quot; the most common , as probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to these studies were an reaction at the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects , which were treated by 252 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; this assessment of clinical evidence shows that in these placebo @-@ controlled trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream frequently used to local skin inter@@ actions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , excav@@ ation / retri@@ eval ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the assessment of clinical signs described in these studies ranged in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very frequent to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe ero@@ sion and c@@ abling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , investig@@ ating the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis was diagnosed with an incidence of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment station or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the worth menti@@ oning of 200 mg of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which is equivalent to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vomiting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred according to several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , observed in hyp@@ ot@@ onia that norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; following the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , the systemic concentrations of the alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ to@@ kin@@ es were detected . &quot;
&quot; in 3 phase @-@ relevant phase 3 efficacy studies , it was shown that the efficacy in relation to a complete evaluation of the exter@@ minated in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment was superior over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; in total , with 60 % of all patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients had healing the pat@@ rons completely ; this was 20 % of the 105 patients treated with placebo in the case ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
a full vote could be achieved in 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od male patients compared with 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od at five mal@@ icious use per week over 6 weeks was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fic@@ ated bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , non @-@ controlled study study after four years of this data indicate that approximately 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients were clin@@ ically hur@@ ried and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od in three weeks of application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was investigated in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ ker@@ at@@ otic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic Ak@@ - les@@ ions within the un@@ hair@@ y scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the interim data from two combined observ@@ ational studies show a recur@@ ren@@ al incidence of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical sampling after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the permitted indications of inc@@ enti@@ ves , ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis and super@@ fi@@ zi@@ elles Bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma occur at pa@@ edi@@ at@@ ric patients usually not examined and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream was examined in four randomised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials at children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies where doses are not shown ( 3x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or respectively ) .
&quot; a minimal systemic intake of 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ osis was observed in three times weekly application during 16 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the highest drugs concentrations in the serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and tot@@ aled 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 ng / ml , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated half @-@ time period was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ time period after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in a previous study , which refers to an extended ret@@ ard@@ ation of the medicine in the skin . &quot;
&quot; the data on systemic exposition showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low to top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with acute ker@@ at@@ osis or super@@ fi@@ able bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ month study to der@@ mal tox@@ icity at the rat no tox@@ icity of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg amounts to significantly reduced body weight and increased Mil@@ z weight ; a four @-@ month @-@ guided study to der@@ mal application showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study for carcin@@ ogen@@ icity in mice at the mal@@ er administration in mice was induced in three days a week .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption from the human skin and does not mut@@ ate , is a risk of people because of the systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors were treated in the group of mice that was treated with the real @-@ free cream , earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with small U@@ VR . &quot;

inform your doctor / your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist / her pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable while applying Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Cream , you should not continue to use the cream area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a serious number of blood cells can cause you to be more pr@@ one to infections ; they can cause you faster a blue fle@@ ck or it may cause aby@@ ss .
&quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice any side effects , which are not indicated in this manual information . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can find it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas where you have applied al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; usually , it is a lighter skin reaction that would like to dis@@ ap@@ point within 2 weeks after termination of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; sometimes some patients have observed changes at the application site ( W@@ und@@ ulating , inflammation , swelling , shame , der@@ mat@@ itis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients suffer from changes at the application site ( bru@@ ising , inflammation , wound and dis@@ comfort ) , inflammation of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , liver pain , diar@@ rhoea , flu , diar@@ rhoea , stimul@@ us pain , fever , weakness or shi@@ vers . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied for enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( symptoms that are not associated with brain or ner@@ ves ) .
&quot; this means certain substances ( gly@@ cer@@ am@@ ino@@ ol , G@@ ags ) will not be min@@ ed , thus in most organs in the body , and these shafts . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements have harder , dimin@@ ished lung capacity , heart disease and eye diseases . &quot;
&quot; treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be supervised by a doctor , who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary met@@ abolic diseases . &quot;
&quot; administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and the patients need to prevent the appropriate medicine in order to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the safety of the drug was investigated , however , its effectiveness could also be measured by reducing its effect on the reduction in the concentration of the concentration of the liver in urine and in terms of the size of the liver . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years of age , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the concentration of G@@ ag @-@ concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the treated children showed a normal liver in the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ thr@@ al@@ gia ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the lim@@ bs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion interface . &quot;
&quot; very common adverse events in patients under five years of elevated blood pressure , reduced oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , speed@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not react sensiti@@ vely in patients ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any other components ( an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will be updated every year with all new information that may be probably known and to update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is recommended to observe the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies . &quot;
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted the European Commission of Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for the placing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mamm@@ al cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ der , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indic@@ ative for long @-@ time enzymes in patients with secured diagnosis of a Mu@@ es@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) indicated in order to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifest@@ ations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor , who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ ed@@ itary diseases . &quot;
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased , if the patient contributes this to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended . &quot;
&quot; safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined , and for these patients no dos@@ ing scheme is recommended . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me patients , in@@ fusion reactions can develop , defined as any of the resulting side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be monitored , and in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be provided in an appropriate clinical environment in which care facilities are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the clinical Phase 3 study , virtually all patients Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase form , usually within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion reaction , must be treated with caution in application of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; as a little experience , due to the recovery of the treatment after a longer dis@@ ruption , the risk of re@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction must be c@@ auti@@ ously given after the theore@@ tically increased risk of re@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reaction . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medications ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and / or anti @-@ py@@ lock ) to minim@@ ize the potential occurr@@ ence of in@@ fusion reactions .
&quot; in case of a light or medium @-@ severe in@@ fusion reaction , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be weighed and / or a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate which occurred in reaction . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are associated with anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; in@@ fusion can be absorbed again with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate , when the reaction has occurred . &quot;
&quot; 3 are used ( anti@@ hist@@ amine and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / is@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) , and a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate which occurred in the previous reaction . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ quin or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of interference with intra@@ cellular absorption of lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not leave any direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data about new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ on@@ ized against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase beyond the breast milk , it is recommended to fit during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; the effects in clinical trials were classified mainly as in@@ fusion reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed . &quot;
un@@ wanted medicines in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me that were observed during the phase 3 study and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are often common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ conditional participation of the upper respiratory tra@@ cts and lungs in the history , moreover , heavy reactions were observed , including bron@@ ch@@ osp@@ asmus , respiratory tra@@ ine@@ qualities and facial expression ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wanted medicines in connection with alco@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with greater heav@@ y@@ rate form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , have been reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients hosp@@ itali@@ zed within 3 months after the treatment of a nap@@ per version , with a severe ver@@ run @-@ form usually occurred within one month to a server version ( average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients at the age of 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature dro@@ p@@ ation from the study ) were det@@ ectable antibodies to 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) Ass@@ ay demonstr@@ able antibodies , including 3 patients who never came to Ser@@ ok@@ on@@ version . &quot;
patients with failure to low @-@ antibodies were a robust reduction in the G@@ ag mirror in the har@@ n while patients with high antibody tit@@ res was observed a variable reduction of G@@ ag in Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in the phase 2 study ) showed a mar@@ g@@ inal up to low neutr@@ alised activity on the enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ as@@ e- activity in vitro which seemed to affect the clinical efficacy and / or reduction in G@@ ag at Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies appeared not in connection with the incidence of un@@ wanted medicines , even if the occurr@@ ence of un@@ wanted medicines are typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reasons for the enzyme therapy is in one for the circulation of accumulated subjects and preventing a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is quickly removed from the circulation and caused by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , the most prob@@ able via man@@ go @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were randomised , randomised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled phase 3 study to 45 patients at the age of 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recruited for the study , the majority of patients had been recruited by the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient demonstrated the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
&quot; patients were recruited when they had been recruited an exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value , and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters . &quot;
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recruited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for a further 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients as a improvement of lung function and the in@@ ability shown in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in the open extension study , an improvement and / or maintaining this effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the percentage prevalence of the percentage is clin@@ ically significant over the period clin@@ ically significant and absolute lung @-@ volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the children &apos;s increase .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a he@@ avi@@ ary deficiency before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached a normal liver size by the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant waste of G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel at the Har@@ n ( µg / mg Kre@@ at@@ inin ) was found that remained constant at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ gene@@ ous disease manifest@@ ation between the patients being taken into account by using a combined end@@ point , the clin@@ ically significant changes in five efficacy and visual acu@@ ity ) was generally consistent with 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deteri@@ oration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; there was a one @-@ year open phase 2 study carried out primarily the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in 20 patients who were enrolled at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with severe ver@@ ge form and 4 with the medium @-@ run form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dose increased due to increased G@@ AG@@ s in Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) was observed after the Z Score for this age group The younger patients with severe ver@@ aging form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe inflamm@@ ations were observed only limited or no progress in cogn@@ itive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations were carried out into the dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dos@@ ing schem@@ ata to the G@@ ag @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute walk test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ing scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an represented alternative for patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions , however , is not demonstrated that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dos@@ ing schem@@ atics is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( EMEA ) will rate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the features of the drug can be updated . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients at the age of 5 was similar to the age of older and less strongly affected patients .

A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in ( other medicines for cancer ) in patients who have not yet been removed ( drugs on cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ign@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) or cancer has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or m@@ apped &quot; non @-@ small cell lung cancer that attacks not the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who previously had not been treated in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in and in patients who previously used other chem@@ otherap@@ ies as well as a few therapy . &quot;
&quot; in order to decrease side effects , patients should maintain a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as folic acid ( vitamin ) and vitamin B12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , in addition , or after the gift of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in addition to an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( drug against vomiting ) and liquids ( to prevent the fluid level ) . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood count changed , or with which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be applied , removed or reduced the dose . &quot;
&quot; the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed s@@ lows down , thus forming the DNA and RNA , and prevents the cells . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in cancer cells is lighter than in healthy cells , which leads to higher concentrations of the active form of the pharmaceutical and a longer period of response in cancer cells . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease in a major study on 4@@ 56 patients .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study enrolled 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( other medicines for cancer ) . &quot;
A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ abine ( a further medicines for cancer ) and both in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy for lung cancer .
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , survived 12 months , compared with 9.3 months in the sole administration of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in patients who previously received chemotherapy had received the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months , compared with 7.9 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; however , in both studies , patients , in which cancer patients were unable to attack squ@@ am@@ ous epithel@@ ium , during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer survival compared to the comparable medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the European Commission to Eli Lilly Neder@@ land B.@@ V. for approval of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; every bottle of water must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,9 % sodium chloride injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a solution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - sis is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with a 0.9 % sodium chloride injec@@ tor ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in displayed on first @-@ line therapy of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for vast array of epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with Lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al carcin@@ oma except for above @-@ hard drive epithel@@ ial hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
the recommended dose of C@@ is@@ plat@@ in is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as in@@ fusion about a period of 2 hours approx . 30 minutes after finishing the P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 day treatment course .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ cell lung cancer , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and sever@@ ity of skin inter@@ actions , the day before and on the day of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed gift as well as the day after the treatment of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days prior to the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses have to be taken folic acid and the intake should be continued during the entire therapy duration and for another 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ rex@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
&quot; patients also need to receive in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular injection of vitamin B12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose , as well as after each third convenience . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ ments , each gift should be created a full blood image , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ bo@@ cy@@ te counting . &quot;
the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment course , a dose @-@ examination for the Nadi@@ r of the blood of blood or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therapy is required . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , the patients need to be treated correspon@@ d@@ ingly to the tables in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with C@@ is@@ plat@@ in . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ icity Crit@@ eria ( CT@@ C v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ CT@@ C degrees 2 blood flow .
&quot; if patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity ≥ degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the therapy must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA to determine the value before the treatment &quot;
treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if patients occur after 2 dose of dos@@ ages or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity 3 or 4 or so on the occurr@@ ence of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
clinical studies showed no indication that patients at the age of 65 years or in comparison to patients aged 65 years is an elevated side @-@ effective side .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use with children under 18 years due to non @-@ sufficient data to un@@ eas@@ iness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical studies , patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min have no dose @-@ adjustment necessary , which prevented for all patients recommended Dos@@ age adjustments . &quot;
data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a bi@@ ode@@ gra@@ dation of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( at Ab@@ - Ess@@ ential of liver &apos;s metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) are not specifically examined in the studies . &quot;
patients need to be monitored in relation to the bone tumor growth and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be administered to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phil@@ count again had a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tic count again reaches a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; a dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the Nadi@@ r of the absolute neutral density count , th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ tes and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction in degree of tox@@ icity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ r@@ ile Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia and infection with degree 3 / 4 Neut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ia was de@@ emed if a pre @-@ treatment with folic acid and vitamin B12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; as a result , all patients with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treated patients need to apply folic acid and vitamin B12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure compared to reducing tox@@ icity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) have to avoid simultaneous consumption of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic acid ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days prior to therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for a treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days before the therapy , at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients with which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurr@@ ence of ren@@ al events , including d@@ eh@@ y@@ dr@@ at@@ ation , existing hypertension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid gathering , a drainage of the eff@@ ace can be weighed in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were recorded in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally when this drug was usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the con@@ current use of atten@@ u@@ ated living materials ( except yellow fever , this imp@@ etus is contra@@ indicated ) not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to reproductive @-@ related damage caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be pointed out prior to treatment - to take advice on sperm cells . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non @-@ ster@@ oid anti@@ ph@@ yl@@ actic acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) can lead to a reduced P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed de@@ position with the result of a prolifer@@ ation of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is provided if patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ inin @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid can be applied in high dosage . &quot;
in@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ actic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ y had been avoided 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data regarding the inter@@ ac@@ tionary potential of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application must be used for at least 5 days before the therapy , the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
&quot; the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of stimul@@ ating status during the illness and the possibility of inter@@ actions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators and ant@@ ine@@ oplast@@ y chemotherapy require increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International Standards Organization ) , when the decision was made to treat patients with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators . &quot;
there are no data for use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed with pregnant women but as with an@@ de@@ dly an@@ tim@@ et@@ abol@@ ites are expected severe labour defects in pregnancy in pregnancy .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be applied during pregnancy except if necessary and challenging and after careful treatment for the mother and risk of employment for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; as the possibility of an ir@@ reversible damage to the reproductive ability caused by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be noted prior to the treatment of treatment , advis@@ ing advice on sperm cells . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving treatment in treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statistically significant improvement of clinical relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ end@@ othel@@ i@@ om has been shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm ( 212 patients ) compared to the sole C@@ is@@ pla@@ - tin arm ( 218 patients ) .
the differences between two treatment arms increased by an improvement of lung function parameters in AL@@ IM@@ TA / C@@ is@@ plat@@ in arm and a deteri@@ oration of lung function during the time in control arm .
&quot; a multic@@ entr@@ e , random@@ ized , open phase III study with AL@@ IM@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NS@@ CL@@ C in patients with AL@@ IM@@ TA treated patients ( Int@@ ent to Tre@@ at population n = 283 ) and 7.9 months with doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el @-@ treated patients ( IT@@ T n = 288 ) . &quot;

&quot; in a third study , all@@ i was compared with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BMI of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who had an average weight loss of 4.8 kg , compared with 2.3 kg in taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with all@@ i in patients with a BMI between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for the patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of all@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots on after , Fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with bo@@ wel movements , bo@@ wel movements , fet@@ ched / ö@@ liger ( drums ) , Flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;

&quot; all@@ i cannot be applied to children and adolescents under 18 , because there are no sufficient data to efficacy and safety . &quot;

recommended to meet additional gay prevention measures in case of severe diar@@ rhoea possible to prevent the oral contra@@ cep@@ tion ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; both in a study on inter@@ actions of medicines as well as in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , a lowering of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma level was observed . &quot;
&quot; in combination of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick @-@ Val@@ ues ( international norm@@ alised , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated in clinical trials up to 4 full years with or@@ list@@ at remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ car@@ otene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patient should be recommended before bed@@ time an supplem@@ entary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement to ensure a sufficient vitality absorption ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a single l@@ ump dose A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on was observed in a limited number of volunteers , which at the same time received or@@ list@@ at , a minor decrease of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments have no direct or indirect effects on pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature , and related to the pharmac@@ ological effects of the drug , because the absorption of in@@ jected fat is prevented . &quot;
gastro@@ intestinal effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally light and temporary .
&quot; the most common symbols are defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , not known ( frequency based on the available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known side effects , which have been determined according to the roll@@ out of Or@@ list@@ at , is not known as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of uncertain . &quot;
&quot; † It is plau@@ sible , that treatment with all@@ i may result in relation to possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal effects . &quot;
&quot; single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day have been administered over a period of 15 days , without significant clinical findings . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of cases reported by or@@ list@@ at @-@ over@@ do@@ zation , either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animal can be derived from a rapid recovery of some systematic effects , which are due to the li@@ pas@@ inhibit@@ ing properties from or@@ list@@ at . &quot;

&quot; clinical studies was recorded that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of approximately 25 % of the food @-@ fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ized , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BMI ≥ 28 kg / m2 cover the effectiveness of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine@@ tic , fet@@ ched diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , was assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as part of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the largest weight loss in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall chol@@ est@@ ess was 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mol / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mol / l ) .

the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of an Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a drug that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um ) .
patients under 18 years is not recommended since the effects in this age group does not lie enough information .
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents the binding of an chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was examined in three major studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , who received the chem@@ otherap@@ ies that are strong or excessive trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , showed 59 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours after chemotherapy no vomiting ( 132 from 223 ) , compared to 57 % of treated patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the excessive trig@@ gers for nausea and vomiting , showed 81 % of the patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy no vomiting ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ d@@ ans@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a comparison with d@@ as@@ et@@ ron , these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ ass@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission granted Helsin@@ n Bi@@ rex Pharmaceuticals Ltd . Ltd . a approval for the distribution of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vomiting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and vomiting in mal@@ ign@@ ant chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi on the prevention of nausea and vomiting which is induced by a strong em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be strengthened by adding one prior to the chemotherapy @-@ given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the col@@ on vaccine , patients with an@@ am@@ nesty Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or Sign@@ ature of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be monitored by injection . &quot;
&quot; as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 ant@@ agon@@ ists , however , caution is provided with the simultaneous gift of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients where the Q@@ T@@ - interval extends , or tend to tend to increase . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics , Alo@@ xi is intended to serve either the treatment of nausea and vomiting in the days after chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not prevent tum@@ ors in the five investigated activity of chem@@ otherap@@ eu@@ tics ( C@@ is@@ plat@@ in , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;

&quot; in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis , the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hibit@@ ors ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , C@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ ic@@ in , ox@@ ox@@ et@@ ess , parad@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , parad@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , parad@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , c@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the cle@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences concerning the application of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies lie not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied for pregnant women , unless it is required from the treat@@ able doctor . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies the most common with a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observed adverse events ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection , heada@@ ches ( 9 % ) and dis@@ sem@@ inal pose ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity reactions and reactions at the meeting place ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dose , similar frequency of adverse events were noted , as in the other dos@@ ing groups , no dose @-@ response relationships were observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis trials were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy with an overdose . &quot;
&quot; in two randomised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250 mc@@ g / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.3 hours ) , which was given in day 1 without d@@ dex@@ eth@@ as@@ par@@ ron intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; in a randomised double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , and Dac@@ ar@@ b@@ az@@ in as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ gram Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron received patients who received 32 mg of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron in day 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of studies with non @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study were conden@@ sed in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vomiting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the corresponding effects of On@@ d@@ ans@@ et@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the general clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the field of vent@@ ine and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers and extend the duration of the promotional potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study involved with 221 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of I.@@ V. for single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0,@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration , a slow @-@ elimination of the plasma concentration is a slow @-@ elimination of the body with an average of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ max ) and the surface under the concentration @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally detected in the entire dos@@ ing range of 0.@@ 3- 90 m / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
after intraven@@ ous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the median mean average ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentration at 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; in pharmac@@ ok@@ in@@ etic sim@@ ulations , the amount of exposure at a daily dose of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in 3 consecutive days reached total exposure ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) which was measured after one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ max after the l@@ ump sum was 0.@@ 75 mg higher . &quot;
&quot; approximately 40 % of the kidneys have been eliminated , and some 50 % will be converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron over less than 1 % of the ant@@ agon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies for metabolism have been shown that CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 and , in smaller measurements , the I@@ so@@ aked CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After a intraven@@ ous dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , approximately 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as an un@@ altered drug made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ in@@ ject , the total body of the 173 ± 73 ml / min and ren@@ al cle@@ ance was 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al period and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increased , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions that are considered sufficient on the maximum of human therapeutic exposure which suggests a small relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 out of pre @-@ clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can block only in very high concentrations of i@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers that can be involved in vent@@ ric@@ ular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( every dose expressed in approximately the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure during humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to a prolifer@@ ation of liver tum@@ ors , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , pancre@@ as , tri@@ pp@@ ies , pancre@@ as , tri@@ but@@ er@@ pe@@ mark ) and skin cancer in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but because of the high dos@@ ages and since Alo@@ xi is intended for single application , the relevance of these results will be low for people . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative report in which the approval of hepatitis C provided for the treatment of hepatitis C for the treatment of hepatitis C / ml injection solution was recommended . &quot;
&quot; this means that Alp@@ he@@ on should be similar to a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; reference ist &quot; ) . &quot;
Alp@@ he@@ on should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a viral infection of liver disease ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ sc@@ opic investigation , the liver tissue damage caused damage , and the values of the liver en@@ cyclo@@ ms al@@ an@@ dic amin@@ ot@@ rans@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are increased in the blood standard . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was produced , which stimul@@ ates this for the formation of the drug . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alp@@ he@@ on placed data that prove the comparison of Alp@@ he@@ on with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( effect structure , composition and purity of the pharmaceutical , mode , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with Hepatitis C , the efficacy of Alp@@ he@@ on was compared with the effectiveness of reference to 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , as many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment of the treatment to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus is recorded in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns expressed concern that data on the stability of the drug and the market@@ able medication should not be sufficient . &quot;
the number of patients with Hepatitis C which spoke to the treatment of Alp@@ he@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after setting up the treatment with Alp@@ he@@ on , the disease occurs in more patients than with the reference rate of reference ; Alp@@ he@@ on had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test was used in the study to investigate how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) , not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go ( one with a cr@@ ushing @-@ in skin infection ) and small infected Laz@@ er@@ ations ( R@@ iss@@ - or chi@@ pping ) , short@@ cuts and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections which have been proven or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) because alarm against this type of infection may not be used .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with the age of nine months , but patients under 18 years may be no longer than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to treatment after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle in which proteins are produced ) and in@@ hib@@ its the growth of bacteria .
&quot; the primary indic@@ ator of efficacy , in all five studies of the patients whose infection was de@@ pressed after the end of the treatment . &quot;
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of the 71 patients receiving placebo .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin customers , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ unden , about 90 % of the patients were examined on treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , Al@@ tar@@ go was observed in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ ents ( filled cav@@ ities in the body tissue ) or of infections that have been demonstr@@ ably or probably caused by M@@ RSA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is an irrit@@ ation at the order .
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go on the short @-@ term treatment of skin infections is higher than the risks of the following superf@@ icial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ ti@@ go , • infected small Laz@@ ar@@ ations , short@@ age or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a approval for the placing of Al@@ tar@@ go within the European Union . &quot;
patients in which there is no improvement in two to three days are considered to be examined and an alternative therapy are considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
in case of awareness or heavy local irrit@@ ation by the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be the treatment is canc@@ eled and an appropriate alternative treatment of infection started .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not to be used to treat infections where M@@ RSA is known as a path@@ ogen or suspected ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical studies with secondary infected wounds , the effectiveness of retin@@ ap@@ ulin was induced in patients with infection that caused by a meth@@ ic@@ illin St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ c@@ cus au@@ re@@ us ( M@@ RSA ) . &quot;
&quot; an alternative therapy is supposed to be considered , if after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deteri@@ oration in the infected place occurs . &quot;
the effect of the simultaneous use of retin@@ itis and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other top@@ ical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentration , which were achieved in human skin after top@@ ical application , an clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition of vi@@ vo is not expected ( see section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After the simultaneous gift of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the middle Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ical application of 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sal@@ be on the skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic application of top@@ ical application in patients , dose adjustments are not required , if top@@ ical retin@@ ap@@ ulin is applied during a systemic treatment with CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproduction of reproduction after oral in@@ gest@@ ion and are in@@ adequate in regards to a statement on the birth and the fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be applied during pregnancy , when a top@@ ical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of retin@@ ap@@ ulin was the gift of a systemic antibiot@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in the decision to continue whether the breast@@ feeding continues to be continued or termin@@ ated with Al@@ tar@@ go , between the benefit of feeding for infants and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies of 2@@ 150 patients with superf@@ icial skin infection , which have applied al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effects of irrit@@ ation at the meeting place , which concerned about 1 % of the patients . &quot;
&quot; mode of action Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deriv@@ ative of P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated through fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the mode of action of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the sel@@ ective inhibit@@ ing of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction on a specific binding of the 50s @-@ unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes which differ from the binding of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acts of anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicates that the connection interface ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ile protein L@@ 3 is involved and in the region of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P Bin@@ der site and the Pep@@ tide transfer centre .
&quot; due to bin@@ der to this binary line , P@@ and@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line inhibit@@ ing the pep@@ ti@@ d@@ yl@@ ation block and block some P @-@ binding inter@@ actions , and prevent the normal education of active 50 carriers of ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of local prevalence of resistance to the use of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infectious forms may appear , an advice should be targeted by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ illin . &quot;
&quot; in case of failure to treatment in S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valentine Leu@@ co@@ cid@@ in ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; Res@@ or@@ ption In a study with healthy adults , 1 % ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was taken daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion in int@@ ages and on the skin of the skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % retin@@ ap@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days to top@@ ical treatment of secondary infected wounds , individual plasma samples were won . &quot;
&quot; the sampling took place in days 3 or 4 , in cases of medication and children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application . &quot;
however the maximum individual systemic intake of people according to top@@ ical use of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment to 200 c@@ m2 ( C@@ max = 22 ng / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 238 ng / h / ml ) = 238 times lower than the ret@@ ard@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP shirts .
&quot; metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ ites was primarily convey@@ ed by CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under low shar@@ ehol@@ ding of CY@@ P2@@ C@@ 8 and CY@@ P2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on oral tox@@ icity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were carried out over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid . &quot;
in @-@ vitro check for gene mutation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma @-@ test or in the cultures of human blood @-@ lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes and in rats @-@ micro@@ core test for In @-@ vi@@ vo @-@ examination chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there were neither by male nor female rats signs of reduced pig@@ til@@ isation in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thereby achieving an elevation of up to 5 times higher exposure than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( top@@ ical application to 200 c@@ m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in an embr@@ y@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity study in rats , at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times of the estimated human exposure ( see above ) , development aid ( reduced weight of the F@@ öt@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and maternal tox@@ icity . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the office needs to ensure that a pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ant system , as presented in the module 1.@@ 8.1 of the application &apos;s application ( version 6.2 ) is present and works before the product is marketed , and as long as the market @-@ marketed product will be applied . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the distribution is required to perform in detailed studies and additional pharmac@@ ov@@ ig@@ il@@ ant activities , as described in the version 1 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) , as well as all additional updates of the R@@ MP , agreed with CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; as described in the CH@@ MP &quot; Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Human use , &quot; the updated R@@ MP should simultaneously be submitted with the next perio@@ dic Safety Update Report . &quot;
&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms on the treated place , you should finish the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and speak to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other sal@@ ts , cre@@ ams or lot@@ ions on the surface that is treated with Al@@ tar@@ go when it was not expressly commanded by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in eyes , mouth or lips , in the nose or female genital area . &quot;
&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment comes out on one of these surfaces , wash the place with water and ask your doctor around advice , if compl@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; after filling the o@@ int@@ ment you can cover the affected area with an ster@@ il@@ en association or a gaz@@ elle band , unless your doctor has got to cover the surface . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminium tube with a plastic cl@@ asp which contains 5 , 10 or 15 grams of salads , or in an aluminum bag that contains 0,5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; ambient is applied to protect against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children between a and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of an existing vacc@@ inations , Ambi@@ rix is used to achieve a protection against hepatitis B after administration of the second dose . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used when Immun@@ ity consists of a low risk of hepatitis B infection , which is ensured that the vaccine tim@@ etable may be carried out at the end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ h dose is requested against Hepatitis A or B , Ambi@@ rix or another Hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
vacc@@ ines work by adding the immune system ( the natural waste of the body ) to resist a disease .
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recogni@@ zes viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; ambi@@ rix contains the same components such as the acc@@ ine vaccine Twin@@ rix adults , which has been approved in 1997 for the first time since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix are administered as part of an existing vacc@@ inations within three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix are included identical ingredients , some of the data based on the application of Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults are also used as proof for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the primary indic@@ ator for the effectiveness was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibodies after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with six months and a 12 month distance between the two injec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children , Ambi@@ rix led a month after the final injection for the development of anti @-@ antibodies against Hepatitis A and B . &quot;
the additional study showed that ambient temperature of Ambi@@ rix was similar in a hex@@ ag@@ re and a 12 month distance between the injec@@ tions .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , lack of appetite , redness , Matcha ( fatigue ) and irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; ambient may not be applied to patients who react sensiti@@ vely ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission granted the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ y@@ s.@@ a. a auth@@ orization for the resort of ambi@@ rix in the entire
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for the basic di@@ mm@@ ing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vaccine doses , the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is given between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her should be wished for Hepatitis A as well as for Hepatitis B , the vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al vacc@@ ines or with a combination skin . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen ( anti @-@ hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) and anti @-@ hepatitis C virus ( anti @-@ hem@@ or@@ rh@@ age ) are in the same size as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ arian vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not fully assured whether immun@@ om@@ able persons have not been addressed , which are addressed to the hepatitis C vaccination , as they may also be protected by immune memory as well as no longer det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for the rare cases of an@@ aphy@@ l@@ actic reaction , according to the gift of the vaccine , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardi@@ zation scheme is recommended , which contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with dis@@ ru@@ ptions in the immune system , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies are achieved , so in these cases another vaccine doses can be required . &quot;
&quot; as a intra@@ ocular injection or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration can result in a sub@@ optimal pulse @-@ fol@@ lower , these injec@@ tions should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , at Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ t@@ open@@ y or blood co@@ ag@@ ulation treatment ambient temperature can be in@@ jected , however , as it can occur in these cases according to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ie@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ rem per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us ab@@ in@@ ae type b @-@ vaccination ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with a combined mas@@ on@@ - m@@ um@@ ps R@@ öt@@ t@@ ine vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients under immune supp@@ ression therapy or patients with immun@@ os@@ defects must be assumed that possibly no sufficient immune response is achieved .
&quot; in a clinical study carried out with 3 vaccine doses of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ology , gastro@@ enter@@ itis , headache , and fever comparable to the frequency , which was observed in the earlier thi@@ omer@@ sal@@ ine and preserv@@ ative vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vaccination up@@ beat at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 300 participants aged 12 to including 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with the 3 @-@ dos@@ ing combinations . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and Matcha based on a calculation base per vaccination dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation base per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0.@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared with 3@@ 9.1 % of the subjects after the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccination cycle , 6@@ 6.4 % of the subjects given to the Ambi@@ rix had been given over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.8 % of the subjects , which had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combinations . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of Mat@@ ern@@ ity was comparable high ( i.e. across the total vaccination cycle at 3@@ 9.6 % of subjects , which received ambient compared with 3@@ 6.2 % of the subjects who received the 3 @-@ doses combine . &quot;
the incidence of im@@ pregn@@ ated pain and Matcha was low and comparable to the combination of the combination short@@ ening with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ sch@@ ema .
&quot; in a compar@@ ative study with 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ old imp@@ lication , the occurr@@ ence of local reaction and general actions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to which in administration with the 3 @-@ dose sub@@ merged pre @-@ activated hepatitis B virus and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the 6- up to 11@@ - year @-@ old , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix a common occurr@@ ence of pain ( at injec@@ tions ) per dose , not per trial period . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported over severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccine schem@@ as with the combination of 360 EL@@ ISA@@ - units and 10 µg re@@ combin@@ ant Hepatitis B@@ - surface anti@@ gen reported was not different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies that were carried out at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 9@@ 9.1 % were a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. , in month 7 ) . &quot;
the serum rates for anti @-@ H@@ BS were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. per month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it received 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combinations with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of 289 people , whose immun@@ ity was ext@@ end@@ able , the serum rates ( SP in table below ) were significantly higher against Hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 to the gift of the 3 @-@ dose @-@ vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical compar@@ ision study at 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds after the completion of the full vaccination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vaccine were either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ sch@@ ema with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ sch@@ ema with a combination @-@ specific hepatitis B virus and 10@@ µg re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in people who were at the time of the prim@@ ers were between 12 and 15 years old , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies could be detected for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ sch@@ ema . &quot;
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to both anti@@ gens was comparable to the vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units that form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B surface anti@@ gen treatment in a dose of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ H@@ BS antibodies were comparable to immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6 months vacc@@ sch@@ ema . &quot;
&quot; when the first dose of ambient was administered simultaneously in the second year of life with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ onic , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ul@@ rem per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ - , in@@ activated poli@@ omyel@@ itis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ op@@ hil@@ us vaccination ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) , or with the first dose of a combined meas@@ les @-@ m@@ öt@@ t@@ ine vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transferred through viral foods and beverages , but may also be transferred by other ways such as bathing in water @-@ wat@@ ered waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( j@@ aun@@ dice ) and other symptoms that possibly require stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as for all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix can not protect completely from an infection with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ inations were completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you are already infected with Hepatitis B or Hepatitis B virus ( although you / your child may not feel un@@ comfortable or ill / feel ) a vaccine may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that may cause liver injury or symptoms , which are similar to the hepatitis B or hepatitis B infection , cannot be convey@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; even if you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiot@@ ic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction may be expressed by ju@@ ck@@ ling skin rash , breath or swelling of facial or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against Hepatitis A or Hepatitis B . • If you have a severe infection with a fever . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to have a protection against Hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the administration of the second vaccination dose ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with Hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with ambient . &quot;
&quot; instead , he will recommend to you / your child 3 injec@@ tions of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine , with a reduced content of effective hepatitis C virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a combined hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ( hepatitis B surface anti@@ gens ) . &quot;
&quot; the second vaccination dose of this vaccine , with reduced salary is administered normally a month after the first dose , and should give you a vaccination protection before the vaccination of the vaccination . &quot;
sometimes Ambi@@ rix is in@@ jected with people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots suffer from skin and not into the muscle . if you are weak@@ ened / your child due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s immune defence / or if you / your child under@@ go down a hem@@ og@@ aly@@ sis .
&quot; ambient may be given in these cases , but the immune response of these persons can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the reaction to the vaccination is . &quot;
21 Say to your doctor if you / your child take further medicines / take up ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without mer@@ ging ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or put into immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) and that in the near future is planned .
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response is not sufficient and the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated at separate places and as possible different gli@@ mp@@ se . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be given at the same time or shortly before or after a injection of immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will be enough . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix is not administered to pregnant or lact@@ ating women except it is urg@@ ently needed to vacc@@ inated both against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot;
important information on certain other ingredients of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiot@@ ic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and make a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

&quot; further side effects , days or weeks after vaccination with comparable combination or individual im@@ pregn@@ ants against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B very rare ( less than 1 case per 10,000 imported doses ) were reported : &quot;
&quot; these include locally limited or extended discharge , the ju@@ cks can be or fl@@ ashing @-@ shaped , swelling of eyes and facial , sc@@ ap@@ ly breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure relief and consciousness . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packages to 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and packs up to 50 without need@@ les available .
&quot; on the basis of data , which has become known since the issu@@ ance of the first approval for the domestic market , the CH@@ MP represented the view that the benefits risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix is positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix was only brought to transport in a member state ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the small patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ium can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ full enzyme or with hyper@@ ammon@@ ium en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ium concentration ) .
&quot; ammon@@ ium is administered - split by several single doses to meals - swallowed , mixed under food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ i ( through the abdominal wall in the stomach @-@ spe@@ ar ) or a nose @-@ shaped ( by the nose in the stomach @-@ leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Ammon@@ aps were not compared to any other treatment or with placebo ( a pseu@@ do@@ er medicine , i.e. without active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ium can also result in loss of appetite , abnormal acid content in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , liquid disorders , abdominal pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , skin rash , un@@ pleasant body od@@ or or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ium in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle was effectively prevented .
ammon@@ ium was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; as due to the disease of the disease at the time of approval only limited information on this medicine .
the use is inde@@ xed with all patients where a complete enzyme gel is already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late defect ( in@@ completely enzyme ) that mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first life of life , an indication of the use when the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese exists a hyper@@ ammon@@ ic en@@ cephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swal@@ low pills , or for patients with si@@ p dysfunction , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated using the protein tolerance and the required daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ e@@ scar@@ ce , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
patients with a Arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cin@@ at@@ synthetic deficiency must be used in a dosage of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with si@@ p disorders , because there is a risk of emergence of Ö@@ s@@ oph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ a if the tablets don &apos;t arrive immediately in the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mol ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with con@@ cili@@ ary heart failure , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore only be applied with caution with sodium re@@ im@@ in@@ suffici@@ ency and severe kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; as metabol@@ isation and separation of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should only be applied to patients with liver or kidney in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results in respect of pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
a sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate for young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) resulted in a slow@@ down of ne@@ ural prolifer@@ ation and a increased loss of neur@@ ons .
it also found a delayed matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning thr@@ ills in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is eliminated in the breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the breast@@ feeding ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) , and 78 % of these undes@@ ired events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very frequent ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ ctic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ating tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ ale , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of an overdose occurred with a 5 @-@ month old infant , with a rare single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dos@@ is@@ limited neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity at a intraven@@ ous administration of doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; Phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abolic active connection , con@@ jug@@ ated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine , which is ex@@ cre@@ ted by the kidneys . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
it is of importance that the diagnosis is early pre@@ mat@@ urely and treatment is started immediately to improve survival opportunities and clinical outcome .
&quot; the progn@@ osis of the earliest symptoms of the disease with the appearance of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always infectious disease , and the disease did themselves with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids , or with its nitrogen @-@ free an@@ alog@@ y within the first half of the year . &quot;
&quot; due to hem@@ at@@ aly@@ sis , the utili@@ zing alternative ways of nitrogen vap@@ our ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , proteins reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ born diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in these patients the survival rate occurred with many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ delay form of the disease ( including female patients with hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ som@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a protein@@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; even existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical states can occur . &quot;
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phenol , which is con@@ jug@@ ated in liver and kidney with glut@@ amine , with phenol acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were obtained after an individual dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with n@@ ett@@ ish healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle , of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ al variety , and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repet@@ itive gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ ate .
&quot; after a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients with ur@@ inary cy@@ c@@ tur@@ alism or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opathy , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after no@@ isy fasting does not have to det@@ ectable phen@@ yl@@ ac@@ acet@@ ate in plasma . &quot;
three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single doses ) were treated five times higher than after the first gifts .
the medication is eliminated within 24 hours to about 80 @-@ 100 % in the form of con@@ jug@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at had not been treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 2800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either by oral ( infants and children , who can still swal@@ low no tablets or patients with si@@ p disorders ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ ke or an Nas@@ en@@ onde Pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experiences the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children weighing over 20 kg and adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ inine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from an early deficiency of Car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ate synthetic or or@@ ni@@ th@@ int@@ ran@@ e@@ scar@@ ce , the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or arg@@ inine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,4 m@@ mol ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mol ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , corresponding to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat @-@ ventil@@ ated were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ but@@ ate &apos;s birth ( active met@@ abo@@ o of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to les@@ ions in the brain stem cells . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old an@@ ore@@ ctic patient , which developed a met@@ abolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lact@@ ating tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , arm@@ yt@@ ale , peripher@@ al neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable with urea ( both connections contain 2 nitrogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore particularly suitable as an alternative carrier for the loss of excess water .
&quot; based on research on the separation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with dis@@ ru@@ ptions of the ur@@ inary cycle , it can be assumed for each gram of sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0,@@ 12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; even existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly reversible , and in some cases a further deteri@@ oration of the neuro@@ logical states can occur . &quot;
&quot; according to a oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ular form , 15 minutes after taking the plasma concentration of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at were detected . &quot;
&quot; during durability , the patient can store the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not exceeding 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in this case the small measuring spoon contains 0,@@ 95 g , the middle measuring spoon 2.9 g and the large measuring spoon 8.6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient must be obtained via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 grams in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare cases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they could not ex@@ ept the nitrogen of proteins in the body after consumption of proteins in the body . &quot;
&quot; if you have conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor to ensure that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium poly@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at can influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
during a breast@@ feeding you may not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS if the medicine might go over into breast milk and damage your baby .
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , headache , taste disorders , cause of ear , disin@@ teg@@ ration , memory disorders , and deteri@@ oration of existing neuro@@ logical states were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you identify one of these symptoms , put yourself immediately with your doctor or with a note of your hospital for a corresponding treatment in connection . &quot;
&quot; if you forget the in@@ gest@@ ion of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; blood cells ( red blood cells , blood cells , headache , irrit@@ ability , headache , fain@@ ting , fluid pain , nausea , fain@@ ting , fluid pain , vomiting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , in@@ agre@@ eable skin rash , rash , kidney problems , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if one of the listed side effects you significantly affect or you notice any side effects , which are not indicated in this manual information . &quot;
you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the cart@@ on and the container of the container up to &quot; specified exp@@ iry date .
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , and contents of the AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whit@@ ish color and oval shape and they are provided with the &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 &quot; label . &quot;
&quot; 30 If you have conducted laboratory studies , you must notify the doctor to ensure that you can influence AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , since sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at may influence the results of certain laboratory studies . &quot;
&quot; when taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other drugs please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if you have taken other medicines or recently taken , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; you should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS available on the same single doses , or via a stomach f@@ ist@@ ula ( hose that runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) and lead the nose ( hose , which is led by the nose into the stomach ) . &quot;
&quot; 31 • remove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon gran@@ ulate . • Stretch out a straight edge , e.g. a measuring sco@@ op above the upper edge of the knife to remove surplus gran@@ ulate . • The recommended number of measuring spoon gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used for the treatment of &quot; acute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms &quot; ( ACS ) , for example , by un@@ stable att@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial in@@ far@@ ction ( heart attacks ) without &quot; St@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; ( one abnormal measurement of electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients that under@@ go a PCI , will be given a higher dose , and in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
&quot; in patients with ang@@ ina or heart attacks , this can help to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI . &quot;
nearly 14@@ 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS in which the effect of angi@@ ox in all@@ ot@@ ox@@ ical or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( GP@@ I ) with conventional combination treatment with Hep@@ ar@@ ine ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a GP@@ I was compared .
&quot; during the PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tubes that remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a sh@@ utter ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab and A@@ spir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS was angi@@ ox - with or without gift of GP@@ I - for preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving a PCI , angi@@ ox was equally effective in terms of all indicators as effective as Hep@@ ar@@ arin , except for severe bleeding , in which it was much more effective than Hep@@ ar@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox should not be applied to patients who possibly are ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in , other Hir@@ ud@@ ine , or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it must also not be applied to patients who had recently had a blood pressure , as well as for people with strong high blood pressure or heavy kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Human Resources ( CH@@ MP ) reached the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI , an acceptable replacement for Hep@@ ar@@ arin . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . approval for the distribution of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of adult patients suffering from acute cor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ ms ( un@@ stable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ lifting ) in an emergency stop , or if an early intervention is fore@@ seen . &quot;
the recommended Initi@@ al dose of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if patients in another result is a PCI , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and in@@ fusion should be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
&quot; following clinical conditions , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately prior to the procedure , a bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the impact . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous membrane , 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and one with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention . &quot;
safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox was not examined and is not recommended if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body@@ weight should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurr@@ ence of a lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines should be carefully mixed and the Bol@@ us@@ dose was administered quickly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , another monitoring is no longer necessary , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney problems ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which should be subjected to a PCI ( if using Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ uses or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4@@ mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is under 225 seconds , a second bolt dose of 0.3 mg / kg is sufficient and the ACT once again prove after the second bolt dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney damage caused by the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) , which led to the approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adaptation for an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 . patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also di@@ aly@@ sis is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the termination of the intraven@@ ous hepat@@ ocy@@ tes or 8 hours after the termination of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of low @-@ molecular Hep@@ ar@@ arin .
• Well @-@ known hy@@ pers@@ ens@@ iti@@ vity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hir@@ ud@@ ine - active blood risk due to a disturb@@ ance of hem@@ ost@@ atic system and / or mis@@ sive immune disease . • severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and di@@ aly@@ sis of patients
patients are carefully developed during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ ine is administered in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; in case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , most bleeding in arter@@ ial places can occur , patients receiving a per@@ cut@@ aneous intervention ( PCI ) occurs during the treatment of princip@@ ally everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are treated War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a monitoring of the IN@@ R @-@ value ( International Standards Organization ) should be taken to ensure that the value for the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in is again accomplished before the treatment level . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge about the mode of action of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ators ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or th@@ rom@@ bo@@ zy@@ ten@@ ants ) may be assumed that these active ingredients are increasing the risk of bleeding . &quot;

both in women and patients treated in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
&quot; heavy bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i Meas@@ ures for heavy bleeding , as in the ti@@ des of table 2 . &quot;
both light and heavy bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the groups with hepatitis C plus GP@@ IB / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and GP@@ IB / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see Table 2 ) .
&quot; an AC@@ U@@ ITY has been defined as one of the following events : intra@@ operative , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular blood flow or blood pressure in the point of action , hem@@ at@@ oma with a diameter of ≥ 3 g / dl without obvious blood pressure , re@@ operation due to blood pressure , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed bleeding , which occurred in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ pod , ear , nose and neck . &quot;
&quot; the following information on side effects are based on the data of a clinical study with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients , which are subjected to a PCI . &quot;
both in women and patients treated in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as in patients with patients over 65 years were more common in adverse events than in male or younger patients .
both light and heavy bleeding occurred among Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under Hep@@ arin plus GP@@ IB / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above were reported according to comprehensive application in practice , and are summar@@ ized according to system organs in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of an overdose , treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in immediately break down and the patient nar@@ rowing with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific thro@@ mb@@ one that bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic center as well as at the A@@ ni@@ on@@ en@@ binary region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , ir@@ respective of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ine is bound in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in in Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and hence its effect , is reversible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in s@@ led the binding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 Pro@@ 4 , which prevents the function of the active Centre of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , induced by Bi@@ val@@ ent@@ ud@@ in with serum of patients in which it has occurred in the past to he@@ at@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , no th@@ rom@@ atic ag@@ gregation reaction was induced . &quot;

&quot; if a PCI was carried out in the following patients , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in should be given and in@@ fusion for the duration of the intervention is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , hepat@@ ocy@@ tes or E@@ no@@ x@@ ap@@ arin was administered according to the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute corpor@@ al syndrome ( ACS ) in patients with inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST bus@@ ses ( IA / N@@ ST@@ EM@@ I ) . &quot;
patients in arms A and B were also randomised to receive a GP@@ IB / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or from the beginning of angi@@ ography ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) or at the PCI .
&quot; the characteristics of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study were the characteristics of high @-@ ris@@ ers , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours evenly distributed over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes , which require treatment with insulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) in the abdominal wall or the upper arm or in@@ jected with an insulin pump .
diabetes is a disease where the body doesn &apos;t produce sufficient insulin for the regulation of glucose ( sugar ) in the blood or process insulin .
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions differ very slightly different of human insulin , and the change means that it acts faster and a shorter mode of work has become a short @-@ effective human@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ effective insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body can not produce insulin , in two trials with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and a study of 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 8@@ 78 adults , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study of 8@@ 78 adults in type 2 diabetes . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the effectiveness was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cine hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes , a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was determined in comparison to a decrease of 0.@@ 14 % for insulin injec@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra must not be applied in patients , possibly ins@@ ens@@ itive ( allergic ) against insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or one of the other components , or in patients who already suffer from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adjusted , if it is given together with a number of other medicines , which can affect the glucose level of glucose . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted to the company San@@ o@@ fi @-@ A@@ vent@@ is Deutschland GmbH for the approval of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is either sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection to apply or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection in the area of abdominal pad or the delta muscle by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of abdominal muscles .
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and reduced insulin change , the insulin demand can be reduced in patients with a limitation of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the effect , the brand ( Her@@ - St@@ eller ) , the insulin ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ ers , etc . ) , the kind of insulin ( animal insulin delivery ) and / or the manufacturing method can withdraw a change of insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 A in@@ sufficient dosage or termination of treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ insulin diabetes , can lead to a hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and a diabe@@ tic diet ; these states are potentially life threatening . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient on another insulin @-@ type , or an insulin of any other manufacturer should be taken under strict medical supervision and may necess@@ itate a change of dosage . &quot;
&quot; at the time of occurr@@ ence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , insulin is dependent on the insulin profile and can therefore change the method &apos;s change . &quot;
&quot; substances that increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( ACE ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Dis@@ op@@ yr@@ amid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ yl@@ line , mono@@ xide , S@@ ali@@ z@@ yl@@ ate , and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tics such as bed lock@@ ers , cl@@ on@@ id@@ ine , Gu@@ an@@ eth@@ id@@ in and reserves the symptoms of ad@@ ren@@ er@@ gen counter@@ claims must be deported or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experiments on reproduction studies showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ist in terms of pregnancy , embr@@ y@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin ch@@ ul@@ is@@ in into the human breast milk , but in general , insulin is neither into the breast milk , nor for oral application it is absorbed . &quot;
&quot; listed below are the disease listed in clinical trials , group@@ ed according to system organs and arranged according to the incidence of their occurr@@ ence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely : ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) ; not known ( frequency based on the available data does not inv@@ alu@@ able ) . &quot;

&quot; li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy is failed to continuously switch the injection station within the injection process , in which a li@@ po@@ d@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy occur in the injection site . &quot;
&quot; severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia with loss of consciousness can be treated with in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ co@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) , which is given by an in@@ jected person or by intraven@@ ous administration of glucose by a doctor . &quot;
&quot; after a glu@@ ing in@@ ject , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the original cause for severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin reduces blood sugar levels by stimul@@ ating the peripher@@ al glucose ( especially by skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as the in@@ hibition of glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that when sub@@ cut@@ aneous Ga@@ - be of insulin injec@@ tions occur faster and the duration of the duration is shorter than hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - act@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic relevant dos@@ ing range of 0.0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg a dose of proportional glu@@ ing effect , and at 0.3 E / kg or more a proportional increase in a glucose effect , exactly like human@@ kind . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a double so fast mode of action , such as normal human@@ ist and achieved the full glu@@ ing effect about 2 hours earlier than human insulin . &quot;
&quot; data from the data was confident that a compar@@ ision of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal a comparable post @-@ den@@ ial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which will be 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions was given in 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ial control was given as a humane normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions will be applied in 15 minutes after the onset of the meal , a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control of the 2 rent@@ ers before the meal is given ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - previously ) before the start of meal , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) before the beginning of the meal ( figure 1A ) as well as compared to human normal levels , which was given in front of a meal ( Figure 1B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin injec@@ tions in gift 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ ISIN - after the beginning of the meal ) , after the beginning of the meal , a 2 @-@ minute ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - previously ) was given before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1C ) . &quot;
