<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg. of processed tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to taking (1 mg / ml) and as injectioning solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. Going thinking and speech, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), mistrust and wasps; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic condition, in which patients manic episodes (periods of abnormal atmosphere) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Abilify is used to treat more serious and severe episodes for the treatment of severe to severe episodes, and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection solution is used for rapid control of increased disturbance or behavioral disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution can be applied to one or the processed tablets in patients who prepares the swallow of tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who simultaneously occupy other medicines, the same as Abilify should be eliminated, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that enable the communication of the nerve cells each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripivzol probably works mainly as "partial agagonist" for the formula for the neurotransmitter Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means Aripivzol such as 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in smaller measurements when the neurotransmitters appears to activate the receptor."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since Dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripivzol contributes to normalize the activity of brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the efficacy of Abilify, the recovery of the symptoms, was examined in three trials over up to a year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of injectioning solution was compared to 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases resulting in increased turbulence, compared to a placebo period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in a further study, Abilify was compared to 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify, compared to 160 patients."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of Abilify injections was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which compared to increased disturbances, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the patient's change was examined using a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients receiving on treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in addition, the company also conducted studies in order to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to set up (up)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution showed patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms than those who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in application for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition to 74 weeks, Abilify prevented previously more effective than placebo which was previously treated to re-occur episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in 10- or 15-mg doses, Abilify injections were also more effective than placebo perceived their symptoms and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 out of 100 patients), headache, blurred vision, dyspepts (severity), headache, blurred vision (increased storage), memory hypersecretion (severity), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomites (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Human Resources (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and medium-serious episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, as well as the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who were mainly manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the result that the advantages of injectioning solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if an oral therapy is not suitable, opposite risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission granted the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a permit to take on the Office of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the bipolar disorder and to the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had mostly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at an maintenance dose of 15 mg / day, irrespective of meals."</seg>
<seg id="30">"an increased efficacy of doses over a daily dose of 15 mg was not detected, although single patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg, once a day, irrespective of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients has not been detected for over 65 years.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be taken into consideration when clinical factors justify that (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 induction is removed from combination therapy, the Aripizzol dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after the change of an antipsychotic therapy, also with Aripivzol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of a epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased suicidal risk involving Aripivzol were compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripivzol should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemia, heart failure, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertonia (including acute and malignant form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which remained a year or less, there were occasional reviews throughout the treatment with Aripivzol in Dyskinesia."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of late dyscans, should be taken into consideration to reduce the dose or reduce the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that indicate a mns, or a clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including ABILIFY, must be set."</seg>

<seg id="47">"in general, a weight gain is generally known in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar manie, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, and lead to severe complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effects of Aripivzol on the central nervous system, caution is advisable if Aripizzol is used in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with such side effects such as seals (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-Antagonist Famotidine, a gastric acid blockers, reduces the retention rate of Aripivzol, but this effect is regarded as clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC by Aripivzol by 107% while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other high-effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and oxoxetine, have similar effects and therefore should be performed similar dosing reductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"when CYP2D6 'poor' (=" poor ") metabolites can result in higher plasma concentration of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentration of Aripivzol compared to CYP2D6."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors, with ABILIFY, the potential benefit should overwhelm the potential risks for patients."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors, might have similar effects and that's why similar dosing reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6 or 3A4 inhibitors, the dose of ABILIFY should be increased to the dosing level before the start of the supporting therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">"according to ABILIFY, Diltiazem or Escalopram) or CYP2D6 can be administered jointly with ABILIFY, can be reckoned with a moderate increase in the Aripiprazol- concentrations."</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical studies, doses of 10-30 mg Aripivzol showed no significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methodology), 2C19 (Ometiczol) and 3A4 (dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if pregnant or a pregnancy during treatment with Aripivzol.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to inadequate data security in humans and due to which in the reproductive studies in the animal case, this drug may not be applied in pregnancy, unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the foetus."</seg>

<seg id="72">"in clinical studies and since the market launch, unintentional or intentional overdosifications with Aripivzol have observed only in adult patients with an estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death sequence."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there are no information about the effectiveness of a hemogalysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripivzol; however, it is unlikely to have hemogalysis in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripivzol has a high plasma connection."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripivzol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is communicated on the combination of a partial agonistic effect on Dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1a- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">Aripivzol showed a high affinity to Dopamine D2- and D3-receptor and to serotonin 5HT1a- and 5HT2a receptors as well as an excessive affinity to the Dopamine D4 and 5HT7- and 5HT7 - to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7 - to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7 - to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7 - to the serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HT7- and to the serotonin.</seg>

<seg id="81">"in a Olanzapin controlled, multinational double-blind study involved in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7% compared to the baseline value (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg) at an average weight of approx. 5.6 kg."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosing over 3 weeks with a manic or mixed episode of the Bipolar-I disorder, Aripivzol showed a placebo surviving efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
