&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with the DO@@ M of the document displayed . as default , the display begins with the root note of the document , for example : the element , all the other no@@ des are sub@@ elements of this root canal . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; displays a further view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to view the content of your local file system .
&quot; the special feature of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in &apos; folder folder hier@@ arch@@ ies with help of a so @-@ called Tree map . Tree maps display the representation of the size of objects in sp@@ at@@ ted structures . each object is characterized by a rectangle , whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must be the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordin@@ ated objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or a folder , whereby the size of an folder is defined as the sum of size of the entries in it . according to that , &amp; FS@@ View may be seen as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; commands you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rectangle , representing a file or a folder in your file system . for simpler navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rectangle that is switched via view of color mode , can be either display depth for the easy detection of the inter@@ ach@@ ute or figure of another file name , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the appropriate file or the folder . for each feature , you can define if enough space is available , only then if there is enough space to display at the sign of the Tre@@ em@@ ap . additionally , you can define the relative position of labelling in the rectangle . &quot;
&quot; at present algorith@@ ms for tre@@ aties , the rule should be observed that the surface is proportional to size of the entry . at the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View ; this goal is not always necessary to show the inter@@ section of entries , and this frame will not be lost if the square &apos;s square is square . &quot;
&quot; such as spl@@ itting the area of a entry to the sub@@ ordin@@ ate entries , the implementation will be left . here it is for the label and avoiding space loss due to always beneficial the surfaces such as lines , columns or recur@@ sive second healing . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minimal space for one entry on the menu entry . instead , a R@@ aut@@ en@@ pattern is drawn into the area of the out@@ ordered entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordin@@ ated entry . &quot;

modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then released as a panel drive . the connection may also be implemented via the Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , dis@@ able software collection for digital cameras , which supports an increasing number of more than 800 cameras . it allows the transfer of images of digital cameras to computer cameras and other peripher@@ als without the need additional driver . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the calcul@@ ator . since photos in general large files are now ob@@ sol@@ ete . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; supports these cameras and leads the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 through . a complete list of supported cameras will find you under this link .
&quot; lib@@ c@@ photo@@ 2 has to be done with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support , so that the EX@@ IF support is used reliably . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support can &apos;t be seen in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things on &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; it is how easy to expand its functionality by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ Interface Project ( manual ) is a approach to developing a common module structure for &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide modules for all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually every way , as it can also be a user . your advantage is that it &apos;s essential , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ated ; by writing a small module to complement one function , as the changes in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simpli@@ fy the window , you can either change the pages with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to the full screen mode with F@@ 11 and C@@ tr@@ l + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and laying of pictures works everywhere : you can retri@@ eve a picture in another part of the aluminum tree , via the horizontal separation line or in another application window . the only limitation is that a picture cannot be taken in keywords , date list , or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to lift the spread out : JPEG , P@@ NG , T@@ IFF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol . so , filtering is also displayed in the file name only if this ind the symbol . which fields are displayed in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; introduces an organized view to your photo albums . these albums can be stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree ; these albums can be stored in a single alb@@ um@@ tree , after the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ ches or after the date where the album was first created , sorted by the name of their collection . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also add a screenshot directly to an album . choose the album Imp@@ orting Screen photo . &quot;

&quot; every picture has been characterized by a long number with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorithm . this allows to compare it images by compar@@ ing these signatures . the less the difference between two image signals , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each image to find a similar one . by using a swelling , the list of results can be enlarged or shr@@ inks . if you push a picture from anywhere above the symbol of in@@ accurate search in the left side bar , then you will open it and you can drop it there . &quot;
sk@@ etch : free hand color sk@@ etch : draw a quick sk@@ etch and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; find the appropriate pictures . also here a swelling value can be set .
this rider presents an intu@@ iti@@ que c@@ ens@@ or tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature program . you can print it out using the mouse wheel or put it out and put it out . if you are using the mouse button . all images within this coordinates are filtered and indicated . of course , this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filters . this will then be added to a later use of the list below . it works like a live Geo@@ Fol@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; introduces a lumin@@ ance in a separate window with which you can compare images . it works with all supported image data formats , including raw files , together . &quot;
&quot; choose one or more images from any view of the main window and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L Add the lumin@@ ous menu . if you are back in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ aire quickly with L Extras . &quot;
&quot; from the Vor@@ one@@ bar you can compare the pictures you want to compare , in the left or right hand of the window . if you perform preview synchron@@ ize from the tool@@ bar and perform loc@@ ating operations at one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two pictures . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to display quickly from a picture series . if you want to navigate quickly from the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures will automatically display into the areas to the link . this will simpli@@ fy the left image in the right side . this will simpli@@ fy it through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , normal lion @-@ actions also work directly from the light table , such as F4 file ... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window are available for both th@@ umb@@ nails . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; in the lower end of each area , you will find a built @-@ in cup@@ board function that you can jump to the visible area of the image , you need to click on these anchor and the &amp; L@@ MB . in the mode both pictures will show the same image section . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works as well as in other views . just use the zoom @-@ kno@@ b among the images or C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse to zoom in the picture and zoom out to zoom . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode preview .
&quot; what is a digital inventory management , taken away from the fashion word ? digital inventory management considers any part of the process after the final output and the permanent storage . each of the photos adop@@ ts , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores form a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not take this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to secure a plan and practical tips such as you can secure your pictures , protect , edit , convert , group@@ ing , backup , evaluate , upgrade , group@@ ing , backup , optimize , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management is based on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , trans@@ forming , transformed , conden@@ sed and exported content speci@@ alising a mon@@ et@@ or or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ ad@@ ata is defined as data on data . met@@ ad@@ ata is defined according to your definition data which provide information on or documentation of other data provided by an application or surroundings .
&quot; I dare to ass@@ ert if you have more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you do not need to find out a specific photo . if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you will not use &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; you can use the met@@ ad@@ ata in a database as well as in the image files , and you can access your programs with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you want to maintain something in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you must decide whether other access to your photo have to be stored or on a network drive &amp; etc ; make sure you need to switch to a bigger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . you may also be found in one year several times at the same place . if you have enough pictures , then you will publish sub@@ folder as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . you will then export a folder for pictures which you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as medi@@ ation of photos , archi@@ ving , work processes , constant supply of pictures to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % archives and 5 % work files will do and you will not want to re@@ organise your structure for this content . &quot;
what kinds of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the st@@ acking box easier . separate new of old files .
the separation of original and labour files are simplified a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are searching for an original or an derived picture .
&quot; we also recommend the met@@ ad@@ ata option in the installation page of met@@ ad@@ ata into &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; it ensures that Ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can finally select the met@@ ad@@ ata from the database in the files by selecting the corresponding item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens when you want to change ? there is a met@@ ad@@ ata Editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now select any photo @-@ words , labelling and an evaluation . of course , you can use all the images that you need the same attribute and then set the value then . this makes sense when you can concentrate on the best photos on the best photos . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s proceed with keyword , key words , such as you are using other programs frequently , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalog@@ ed pictures from a different source with built @-@ in head@@ boards , then add the tree to the correct spot . the reverse of the hier@@ archy within the tree is not a problem and can easily go through the pull of a sub@@ tree to another . the changed keywords are taken by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; updated while the trees follow . &quot;
&quot; the graphics shows how different met@@ ad@@ ata is over@@ cut . this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ ad@@ ata in truth consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are the properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the passwords , the next section refers to labels or comments , the third important tool for catalog@@ ing your met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; you want to let most of your photos simply to see them , they want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; look at this panorama . from the distance it &apos;s not even a nice beach panorama . if you consider it closer , then catch some details , people , the space . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that this is the landing field of the Allies &amp; quot ; Omaha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; Omaha beach span the 60 years after the landing . Wow ! one starts to dream , memories , the historic span is back again , you may possibly even hear the silence . the lab@@ eling has completely changed your perception of this panorama . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos is possibly more important than the picture itself . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is it to understand Him on the motive that you move , which you understand what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine , if a picture is not perfect , if the strength only has a lab@@ eling for themselves alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous , you can save a lot of text , in an internation@@ alised alpha@@ bet ( UTF @-@ 8 ) , as lab@@ eling . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . if you export your pictures into web galleries and then you will tell the story about your wishes in the labelling and / or the title of web @-@ gallery . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find out in another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Google Earth ? good because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation now already with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of ge@@ ol@@ oc@@ alization are already counting and will still be deeper into the future . I &apos;m sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travel with Google Earth . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc . you can also export the pictures to Google Maps . &quot;
&amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word match with copyright and describes the practice of copyright to remove limitations on the distribution and change of copies . the same fre@@ ed@@ oms are also applicable in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information in the setting page of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; as information shall be deposited :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for narr@@ ator and authors ) : this field should add your name , or the name of the photographers , for example to protect the photographers name , then the name of a company or organisation can not be changed . after this value , it should not be changed again . this field does not support even Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; aut@@ ort@@ ment ( syn@@ onym for author ) : linked with the author . this field contains the employment name of the photographer . examples of this field contains the title of the photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . as this is a Ver@@ mer@@ k to the author &apos;s field , this must be the same . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for suppliers ) : use the An@@ bi@@ dder field to identify and identify the photo . if the photographer doesn &apos;t need to be the author , like Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , you can &apos;t necessarily need the picture another . if the picture is a clip , then the group / agency is provided here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this has no protection against mis@@ use . everyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator . for individuals , this is important for the majority of your photos only of small interest . for professionals and hal@@ b professionals this protection is very important to protect it . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique in unique . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; in the near future there will be such a module for pil@@ ing processing .
&quot; topics : record error , record loss , power sur@@ ges , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disin@@ teg@@ ration , life time , temperature , data size , widespread super@@ st@@ ition &quot;
of course we don &apos;t talk about CDs that are lost on the street or a fire . these kind of losses are the same which can also happen to you with traditional paper photographs or negatives . in this section we are concerned about problems with the so @-@ called New Media .
&quot; Kro@@ ell On@@ track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which has a data loss . &quot;
&quot; to fight the problem with CDs / DVDs , these c@@ auti@@ ous should be treated and you may no longer keep you more than a few years . of course , you can also get CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are more difficult to get more difficult and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 this piece has a lifetime of 100 years for itself . if you believe it is in your survey@@ ing space . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD Dis@@ ks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you can reduce the good dis@@ ks and good recording , but they are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . so it is therefore the right to choose . &quot;
&quot; these CDs and DVDs are very sus@@ cep@@ tible to mistakes , even if you are just writing only . therefore , they use a controls mechanism to protect themselves . 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we need for the form@@ att@@ ing and the control sw@@ amps . despite this massive protection , they are needed for form@@ att@@ ing and the control environment . despite this massive protection , they are needed for the form@@ att@@ ing and ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works miracles on CDs and DVDs ; it &apos;s still not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that have damaged data from damaged flo@@ pp@@ ies , hard drives , flash media , USB drive plants etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to win the format war against HD DVD . a dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . of course it is also true for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; slow down the media with a good recording device on high quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ety format . you should then read the media with a description , date &amp; author mark and then store the data to the next generation of media , before you can read the latest hardware or software that can read the media . &quot;
&quot; flo@@ ats maintain your statistics for themselves . your manufacturer &apos;s productions include a new disk , but not the data . Google has a major campaign about the error mechanisms of hard drives available : dis@@ continu@@ ity &quot;
&quot; shortly , if you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C to 45 ° C. The error rate of the controller are the most common error cause , SM@@ ART cannot determine this error . some of the SM@@ ART can cancel the error . these are especially read@@ ability and publishing counter . the expected age @-@ time period is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is just about the complete losses due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also save data loss due to a current loss before you secured the files , but these losses could normally be produced without great problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical equipment can &apos;t make a lot of electrical equipment . these can be heavy damage from devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed connectors . these may protect these anom@@ ali@@ es from blocked keyboards , complete data loss , hard@@ war@@ dness , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from un@@ avo@@ id@@ able that lead to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; most common protection against current tops is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that is absorbed , and the rest is absorbed . however , it is usually found in the form of a plug . it is normally not any plug @-@ in system . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should pay attention to the UL 14@@ 49 Standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . you should also ensure that it protects against lighten@@ ing and therefore protects the properly connected devices . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripher@@ als can be connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mode@@ ms as well . some manufacturers feature over@@ voltage sho@@ cks that also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable mode@@ ms and the TV . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are designed specifically for not@@ ebooks , and therefore you also contain the protection for the modem . so you are ideal for on the road . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection must protect your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines it will not really help you . even a failure of few seconds can lead to loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . therefore , it can be useful to invest in a interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection from over@@ l@@ ash@@ ings , these devices can automatically be able to store your data and run the system . some models allow them to work and run the system . if you want to purchase a US@@ V , you should be sure that they are the same quality requirements like an over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the enclosed software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk to avoid your computer system , and compare its safety in electricity disorders with the cost of avo@@ idance of this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can be protected for less than &amp; euro ; 40 % . finally , you should always remember all the cables before you get into vacation . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can use this as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to store this as backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that you can store any amounts of data . &quot;
&quot; compared to the hard drives at home , however very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . furthermore , you must send the data via the compar@@ atively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore suitable as a solution to a local data loss of the most important pictures . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services available to photos . your free memory is limited to you . the professional variant is not available for you in case of Fli@@ ck@@ r dramatically more . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory which should be reviewed until reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically adjusted with the TCP protocol and the big companies is included in the offer . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ ably secure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are applicable to transmission errors . the file system and b@@ tr@@ fs represent at least the data base between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that no one has occurred to you if there is no transmission error occurred to you . all these disturb@@ ances remain un@@ discovered until you should not have any protection in your computer . nobody seems to worry about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a significantly more secure data route than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable grid parts are a further source of transfers , since they create inter@@ ferences within data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected by transfer problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 , you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS from Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates to deal with record errors , and highly scalable . it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for Linux ; and Windows is available . please read this article in English . &quot;
&quot; Oracle has started its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem , which is still in the alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that is used and is also available for Linux ; but it &apos;s not part of the kernel . &quot;
don &apos;t under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of the data loss in not@@ ebook and 46 % for job systems . while not@@ ebooks is the share of theft 50 % .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most . it is limited to lower damage , e.g. theft or re@@ installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; there was no longer sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less sus@@ cep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reis@@ er@@ FS , J@@ RC and X@@ FS to call the common file systems . you can find a very good English article here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupt data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during a surgery is higher and a defined status is avoided . if a file was not completely stored before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
viruses are the greatest threat to digital data : false , theft and human mistakes are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras sensors are removed 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ ture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology develops further , there is a natural limit for these progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics are not far from this border far from this border . &quot;
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xels . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result is ideal for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ xels . for higher resolutions you need a full format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; a 750@@ GB hard drive will get you today for 100 &amp; euro ; so you do not need anyone responsible for data loss . therefore , your data are frequently affected by a data loss . so backup your data frequently after a plan and test this backup before you make anything dangerous like the re@@ installation of your operating system , the exchange of records or the size of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take your f@@ uses on an external SATA drive daily . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected to the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests local and destroyed a lot . forget aircraft accident : fire , water , electricity , children and rob@@ bers are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect an entire room or the whole house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ astic is always a local store . bring your f@@ uses up the stairs , into the neighbouring house , in your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as mentioned above is a more common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup , which is not immediately available , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files should be secured . it is a snap@@ shot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
&quot; differentiation : securing the files that have been changed since the last complete system , generates a complete snap@@ shot at two points : to the complete backup and the last difference . &quot;
&quot; incre@@ mental backup : securing the files the last backup has been changed since the last backup . it is generated by several moments . you can restore the original status at any time , and this backup comes next with the exception that it only takes off and not continually . &quot;
r@@ sync is a wonderful small tool that you can easily setup your machine . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP meetings or any other types of file transfer script files r@@ sync only the difference of files that really changed . this happens and if you want to increase your safety via ssh .
secure important pictures directly after you saved them on your computer on a DVD or any other optical media .
&quot; this approach makes you enough time to discover and restore levels . at the same time , you get a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snap@@ shot for at least one month and a snap@@ shot for each month . every additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ ad@@ ata , stored in the picture file stored IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original keep , memory , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ inv@@ ent pictures and met@@ ad@@ ata , copying the pictures to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , visibility , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; to make valuable images to survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the time span in which you really interested in you are because they are remin@@ ded of your childhood and youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predic@@ table due to your nature , you need to look at all things today with caution . unfortunately , there is no other way to manage as the current system backward . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered with the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
&quot; virtu@@ alization is available today for everyone . if you have an old system important to read your pictures , then store it and install it in a virtual machine for a later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and security technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the professional pressure for the possibility of changing a system in its size . this actually means to increase .
let &apos;s get out that you have entered the scal@@ ability with plans and have a section that you want to enlarge to a dedicated board or partition . * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and run onto a new plate :
&quot; check the d@@ mes@@ g command , if your new record was detected by the system , but don &apos;t hang them . &quot;
/ dev / SD@@ B &#91; # &#93; of = / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / S@@ DC # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the record in MB@@ H ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , FAT@@ 16 , 32 and Reis@@ er@@ FS &amp; dollar ; resi@@ li@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of Reis@@ er@@ FS if necessary &quot;
open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day is no software that can read it then you can create this yourself . this task will be easier by year .
GIF is a proprietary and patented format dis@@ appears slowly from the market . you should not use it anymore .
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard , but it can replace a lot more . it is loss @-@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ ad@@ ata , 16 @-@ bit pro color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is required that there are relative many administration information , but not as many as T@@ IFF , and not as many as T@@ IFF and recommend it to store your pictures . &quot;
T@@ IFF was widely used as an image format . T@@ IFF can be saved in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a loss @-@ free compression sal@@ low ( de@@ fl@@ ate ) . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The Digital Negative file format is a free and open resource format designed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG was developed due to the requirement of the camera formats . it is based on the T@@ IFF / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon .
&quot; this is probably one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Metad@@ ata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mix of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is provided with the enlargement &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; saved the file information for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to view a original picture of your recording , mostly in the rough format , because it is the met@@ ad@@ ata separately from the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together there . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Metad@@ ata Initiative is an open organization that focuses on completely compatible online met@@ ad@@ ata and business models . to the activities of D@@ CM@@ I work groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard connections and clari@@ fication efforts to achieve a widespread acceptance of met@@ ad@@ ata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the cam@@ er@@ aman , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and store these in your shell archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine @-@ layer processing , you can use external programs . if you have the pictures again with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then you should add the met@@ ad@@ ata . these were cut under circumstances of other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright law with a digital water@@ mark . export it only then in Web@@ gal@@ eries , code in MPEG , use in contact leaves , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; in the section of adding a photo to an album , you can add a description , as you have already installed on your hard disk , but you will find many advanced settings for import@@ ing pictures to your Alb@@ end@@ ate database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; to use , connect these with the machine , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it off . another description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , this is trying to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , there will be an open @-@ indicator at the lower end and the th@@ umb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will be displayed . some cameras do not appear any pre@@ ferences and a symbol for file association settings for each file , photos , movies , music etc . &quot;
&quot; before you can download the photos on your computer , you may need to download the camera reports and met@@ ad@@ ata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an updated or its met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
this dialogue shows file characteristics and the photo information attached to the intern@@ ally of the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded from your computer . note that in some digital cameras do not provide any information available .
&quot; the Rider Metad@@ ata shows the internal met@@ ad@@ ata such as EX@@ IF , Manufac@@ ture , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as with the met@@ ad@@ ata side bar from the main window of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; or the image processing . note that this met@@ ad@@ ata is not available with some digital cameras . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to download photos on their computer is the click on the button to download , and then download the photos from their camera to a single album in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; for downloading the pictures are safely downloaded in an album before you delete the photos from the camera . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to download all the photos , you can only select the desired option with the standard optional choice of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can download the button to download and then select the selected button . the button is selected as long as you have chosen some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is available for download . these pictures have not been downloaded from &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; downloaded in this case , the new pictures are downloaded with a star in the fore@@ front window . if you choose this option , you will only download the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; if you are able to download or download the buttons you can be downloaded in which the photos are sorted in which the photos are sorted manually , as normal folders , you can read the list from the list below and press OK . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; invites photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete this from the camera . you can delete all on once by delete the button delete All delete . if you only want to delete a few , you must first select and delete the delete selected . &quot;
&quot; note that there are no possibility to restore photos that you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos are successfully removed from the camera . if you want to delete the camera or delete it , you should delete it from the camera , as this is substantially faster . &quot;
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photographs not particularly well @-@ known names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are usually loaded after the photos of the camera . therefore it can be useful to put the photos of different shooting criteria into the same album . therefore it can be useful to integrate the date and time in which the image has been made in the fil@@ en@@ ames .
&quot; next section , you will find options for turning and sk@@ e@@ wers in the picture and for database @-@ based under@@ wear . if you use this last option , a file will be created per day . &quot;
&quot; the options During the transfer will open three further options , which are carried out before the photos stored on the disk . the first two concern the data concerning the author in Section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ arity . if you select this , you can correct the corresponding entries from the EX@@ IF information to the IP@@ TC fields . with the latest option you can correct date &amp; time for all shut@@ down images . &quot;
&quot; if you want a different file format as the default format , you can add the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % d % d % H : % M : % M . turn the option on the date and time . for more custom@@ iz@@ ations you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the camera file names , you have the possibility to change the fil@@ en@@ ames in small letters . or in case letters if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; for a photo , is displayed below the name displayed the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming will be stored and automatically used when you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to record a automatic rotation while making it . not all cameras represent this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ ad@@ ata you can read more details about the information that has embedded your camera into the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic turning point is usually turned on , and if your camera will not supplies this information , and if you want to turn off the automatic turning off , use the button Advanced and select the automatic turning point in the lower area of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera has been made information on the date where the photo was made available , &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; this sub@@ al@@ ps are based on the picture data . all pictures with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . all cameras with the same date are uploaded into the same sub@@ album . not all cameras are available in the same sub@@ album . in the section side@@ bar Meta @-@ data you can read what information your camera could be embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case stores &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this option , you need to add this option to the lower end of the window at the lower end of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos of your machine on their camera is the button to download . select then upload , and select the file extension dialog &amp; K@@ DE ; you can also select more than one file using the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; you , where the images are to be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera will be released . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the pictures are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Position@@ ing System ) is used as a general term in this document . thus , a position is meant to be displayed in long@@ itude and lat@@ itude that can be displayed on a map . identi@@ fying the data can be carried out by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galil@@ eo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographer , it can be interesting to link an image with a precise ge@@ ographic place . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ ing an area through automatic recording of GPS data . environ@@ ment@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later , where exactly the photo was done , you can open a browser which shows the area . if you want to locate a postcard to another &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; users want to locate , or simply document that aspect , it is well to en@@ rich the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is , how do the GPS data come into the image ? first , you should know that ex@@ tras are many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ing and card refer@@ r@@ als . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the right hardware , via a reproduction of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic assignment ( manual ) and last over the manual input of well @-@ known places . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is no camera integrated currently with a GPS unit . but there are a few that work with GPS receiver . either as a map module , or through transm@@ itting the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye iP@@ A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ dak D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ric@@ oh Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel . however , you have to save those data in the GP@@ X format as it is the only format supported by the module for ge@@ ographic assignment . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract the data from pictures and from the GPS . on the following page you can use the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and lat@@ itude or other data , you can use this script which uses the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the names of the names that are created by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com shows no European street types . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish that show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;

&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standard candidate and copyright data . these data will be automatically selected into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields , if the data is synchron@@ ized in the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; aut@@ ort@@ ment is a syn@@ onym of the editor : this field should be the professional name of the photographer , as for example , freel@@ ancers , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer or more independent , commercial photographer has to be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to use the photo . this must not be the author , as e.g. Reuters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here . if the picture is a warehouse , then the group or Agency will be available here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store data into the corresponding IP@@ TC rock . this means that met@@ ad@@ ata is permanently included in the picture and not only available in the database of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; this met@@ ad@@ ata is also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; without being lost .

&quot; the settings of the light@@ ness of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; can be set on this page on the default values . every time you will use different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can only get on fast computers . if you have one , then you can get better improvement results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can activate the tool bar if you can use the tool@@ bar in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and sub@@ str@@ ated areas of a picture can be marked with dark or bright color in the picture . these colors are fixed here . in the image processing , this review can be switched with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
&quot; with Chro@@ ma Sub@@ sampling , the images can be coded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia to the next explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ less algorithm . the only effect is that the image data is more time to compens@@ ate and un@@ packing . in this case 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the T@@ IFF files option , you can activate the de@@ fl@@ ate compression sal@@ v@@ m for T@@ IFF @-@ images . this reduces the size of the T@@ IFF @-@ images . it has no influence on image quality , since the de@@ fl@@ ate -@@ algorithm has no loss . &quot;
&quot; with the loss of loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you were writing the los@@ s@@ less adjustment , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than in normal JPEG . when this paragraph were not supported , met@@ ad@@ ata were not yet supported , but was in planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous , the image processing was only a picture viewer . currently , it develops very quickly to a tool for manipulation of your photos . with this dialogue you can change the settings of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the standard measure is that all green pixels are equal to ultra@@ violet light . if you use this option , this is a little bit soft when you use this option with a minimal loss of details . this option is characterized by a little soft , elimin@@ ates the 2x@@ 2 pairs with the V@@ NG@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white is equal to the camera . otherwise , if set the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only if the white is not set off . standard is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white card that was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting will only be supported for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SLR cameras . the use of the second sensors have the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the Spitz@@ lich@@ ters . for other cameras this option will be ignored .
&quot; the standard is the Sp@@ ect@@ ter , i.e. the parts of your pictures are burned , because of the in@@ ability of your camera displays the hair@@ less results in the settings . in this setting , you can try setting some parts of the missing colors in the settings . finally , you can try some parts of the missing information from the lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels in general are not so quickly satisfied as green and red . and d@@ cra@@ w therefore try to recon@@ struct the missing blue and red shares of the still not saturated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how many color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option re@@ design , you get the option to set up a level . here is a value of three a compromise and can therefore be adjusted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value to your taste . you &apos;ll probably have to set him somewhat higher than standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; to keep the time for the demo file , you should have more conservative . &quot;
a demo act algorithm is a digital photo process to calculate a complete picture of the particle data that have many cameras and one of the matrix @-@ coloured pixels are also known as CFA inter@@ pol@@ ation or color construction .
&quot; and there are three alternatives to you : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests it was used . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( variable number of gra@@ dient ) was the first algorithm to the edges . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting , if you are looking for a quick solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the colour of your lenti@@ ls , you can set the rot@@ - and blue @-@ proof values here . this is certainly the best method for a colour difference if you run during the conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates to color formations and instructions such as these should be given . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; information like the color space in the other can be translated as precisely as possible .
&quot; behavior Questions , when a picture opens in the image processing / color management module with raw files . &quot;
colour profile folder S@@ etting here the folders such as / us@@ r / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC where you all store your profiles . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; then exam@@ ines this folder then during the start .
settings of the ICC profiles you have the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file later .
the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Arg@@ y@@ ll . here are just your pictures coloured not the whole screen .
&quot; the input profiles should be used to the camera controllers and model that you are using . not all profiles are based on the same type . there are some , such as Canon , which does not contain color tone or gamma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w Gamma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means you need to carry the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are further options such as the soft @-@ pro@@ of @-@ profile , which you can em@@ ulate , as your printer may be given a smaller colour range than your camera and some colors are therefore very satisfied , instead of leaving your printer on the blind algorithm . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite apparent , which colour profile is intended for you . unfortunately not for the models of Canon . so here a table of cameras and profiles can fit together . this answer is of course un@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profiles extension makes the style for the target : F for an accurate style , L for landscapes , N for neutral , P for portrait and S for the standard style . &quot;
K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in interface . it is an interface supported by a range of &amp; K@@ DE ; picture issues and educational work . many modules support that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface .
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the list that you want to use and then you will find out as new entries in the main window of the main window and beyond . &quot;
&quot; for tasks that are carried out by modules , you can set up in the menu below settings for short commands . &quot;
&quot; for more information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules , you can get via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ti@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org , or to the K@@ IP@@ I modules . &quot;
&quot; the settings of the Di@@ vor@@ au should be easy to understand . the upper regulator is adjusted just between the frame outputs , usually it is 4 @-@ 5 seconds well . the other check boxes turn the met@@ ad@@ ata or , resulting in the bottom end of the pictures during the display . &quot;
&quot; camera properties are shown on the left side a list of all the time supported cameras . on the right hand , a camera that is connected to the computer is enabled . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is properly connected , switched on and in the picture line . currently there are serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire devices ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) . this field is only active if you have selected a US@@ B@@ - or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to set up the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / , in which you hang up your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer to switch it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the camera automatically det@@ ects . if not , you can set camera models and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear on the camera . &quot;
you can select any name for your camera . this is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you have more than one camera you can insert all here .
with the option confirmation dialog for shifting of &gt; pictures in the tr@@ ash . you can adjust the talk of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; in the extingu@@ ishing of a photo and delete a album you will find more details .
&quot; the editorial changes through the right side bar can be shut down through &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; be applied if you use the changes in the right side bar without warning . otherwise , you must apply the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also attach the indication of the welcoming screen of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; in the starting line . this acceler@@ ates the starting procedure of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ;
&quot; the setting up to new photos are looking for new photos , looking for new or deleted albums / photos . this extends the starting time of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; if something from the base folder was deleted , asking &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
different colour schem@@ as can be used in &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; used to adapt the main window to your taste . you can select the settings from the tool@@ bar . a preview of available designs will be listed below :

&quot; the image processing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; therefore , you are not part of your distribution . for more information about the K@@ IP@@ I modules can be found in section image processing . &quot;
&quot; status bar at the lower edge of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current fil@@ en@@ ame , magni@@ fication factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top edge and among them the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly used functions .
editing functions of imaging editing change your photos . however , no need to change the original photo before you save the file Save or the button Save from the tool@@ bar . notice that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the picture . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can store using file save as well . &quot;
&quot; as long as you do not have saved the photo , you can restore the original image by re@@ produce or the button The button re@@ produce re @-@ produce in the tool@@ bar . you will lose any change you have carried out in the photo since the last store . &quot;
&quot; virtually every action of the image processing can be revers@@ ed or re@@ produced . the last action can be revers@@ ed , by using editing , or re@@ produced by selecting Edit from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently you should make the key abbrevi@@ ated , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ z to return and C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Rem@@ sch@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB , in the tool@@ bar , press a moment longer , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you start the image processing , you can use between the photos in the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation bar in the tool@@ bar , picture up , picture down or the entries in the menu file . if you have done changes on the current photo you will be asked if you want to back up . &quot;
you can in the photo in and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the code menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can automatically select this button in the tool@@ bar : magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full @-@ Mode menu shows the photo in full screen mode . if you don &apos;t want to use the Es@@ c key . if you don &apos;t want this , you can see this in the installation dialog by &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; you can see this in the setup dialog . you can also see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the actual picture , you can print in the menu image and get the Standard &amp; K@@ DE ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print individual images or whole sentences . all photographs can be selected from your selection . you need only select the pictures with the default methods and you need to follow the wi@@ z@@ ard from the menu record . if you follow the wi@@ z@@ ard you will need only your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; the main window has a side@@ bar on the right edge , the important information and promotions available for the selected pictures , also available in the image processing . it is displayed if one of the five riders are cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple click on the same tab the side@@ bar will appear and disappear again into the edge .
&quot; in the labelling view , you can add sha@@ des with unlimited size or insert . note that all special characters are allowed . the labelling are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters , and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters will be transformed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications , you should consider these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after having commented it , use either the button to use or switch to the next picture , the labelling will then be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more met@@ ad@@ ata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also read met@@ ad@@ ata into the files . but this will always be done when you have chosen a met@@ ad@@ ata settings . &quot;
&quot; the review rating shows an assessment scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar , or with the key abbrevi@@ ation C@@ tr@@ l + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate more pictures simultaneously , select this from and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the coding follows the sch@@ ema in the following table :
&quot; the sample view shows a search box for filtering of j@@ ig@@ s , the keyword tree , and a selection box with the previously shown in this &amp; di@@ gi@@ um ; -@@ session fitted keyword . &quot;
&quot; the keyword tree is adapted dynam@@ ically to the specified search phrase , you can quickly limit the number of possibilities in search of a keyword quickly . this ability is especially useful if you have many keywords . &quot;
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further relief when inser@@ ts by j@@ ig@@ s in a picture series . if you have entered various keywords , these are stored for quick access . &quot;
&quot; keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree , and all keywords are stored into the IP@@ TC field . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are selected in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , it will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the whole selection , if you want a selection with a keyword , please read the Key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sample filter is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side bar with their album , - Dat@@ um@@ - , keyword and addic@@ tions are used . if in addition , one or more sample filter from the right side is displayed , only the inter@@ section of these two are displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also pull out the tags and place out . suppose you have selected several pictures in the main view , so you can easily go out of the right side bar and put it onto the selection . as a result , a dialogue that asks you if you want to set the keyword . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the pictures on a calendar day . the keyword filter is not reduced to three images . they were selected using C@@ tr@@ l + a , and after that a keyword is taken out of the right hand tree to the selection and put it out there . a dialogue asks if this keyword should be set . &quot;
&quot; this search for changes takes place at every start of the program , and you can also be switched to settings . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be a or be , you can easily edit it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the rule area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry , searched after which is found in the database . this may be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or a string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can define an advanced search about all elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then use the button group as follows : &quot;

this article / Tut@@ orial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly worked on &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you set up a color@@ fully workflow , which can be used by the colors of your camera or scanners , you can reach the colors on your monitor to those of your camera , or scanners , and those in the web release you from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; if the subject comes to color administration , everyone wants to know which buttons he needs to press for the results you want . unfortunately , colour management that you make informed decisions at every point of image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you will provide information with deeper information to make your own informed decisions make you want to make the desired list . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria below , you must not take care of the administration . &quot;
you work on a monitor which is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB paint space . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image editions are by e @-@ mail or web , where the RGB of the de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB does so well , and the life for everyone is so simple , why should one use another colour space and have to make thought about color devast@@ ation ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors that we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hu@@ t@@ ant@@ isen@@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB paint space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ Dimen@@ sion@@ ing representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color trees , so you can visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms home page and then click on info about RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I have to answer my monitor if I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB color space ?
&quot; yes ! if you are working in the s@@ RGB paint space or not , you need to calibr@@ ate your monitor . if you &apos;re working as a RGB base of s@@ RGB , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , you must either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use a further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the standardi@@ zation , equal , automation , and contrast expand from the menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting automatic correction will automatically try to make the best of your colors . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which is best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize the method , the leu@@ k@@ est point is sc@@ aled above the whole picture so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color sha@@ dy . this function is often an Mag@@ ical correction for images that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; the same : this method is adjusted to the lumin@@ ous factor of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity value is as flat as possible . thus , almost every Hel@@ lig@@ ation range achieves the same number of pixels . sometimes it produces a very powerful operation , which causes either a miracle in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic switch : this method maxim@@ izes the color range in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright border tones and adjust the red , green and blue channels to the entire Hist@@ o@@ gramm@@ ar area . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and lumin@@ ous intensity of the RGB values of a image through the post@@ p@@ one of the lowest and highest values in the highest possible area , and a re @-@ ji@@ ffy of all values . this is only visible in washed pictures and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
the bald @-@ off of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous was a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white off of a photo .
&quot; the white @-@ equal correction is somewhat limited to over a color space with 8 @-@ bit per suit . if you can also go to the content of the original size , if you can perform the white off in rough mode , which in 16 @-@ bit mode , your possibilities will be better to correction . &quot;
this tool is based on an tin@@ plate equivalent of Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start over the menu entry colors white off the image processing .
&quot; the front window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original picture shows both the original picture and the preview of the tool@@ box . if you want to see the original welded on the left , it is enough to click on the bottom window . &quot;
the preview of the destination photos has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ anz of the Pi@@ xels at this marker is displayed as vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; right up , a hist@@ ogram indicates that dynam@@ ically changed when you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit pictures , most pixels are very small L@@ umin@@ ant values . with one button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is indicated . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on sha@@ dows , satur@@ ation and gamma . shadow Adjust@@ ment lets you improve your photos or di@@ mm@@ ing your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play with the above controls , you should use the colour temperature Pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then anywhere on the picture preview for the calculation of color temperature of the white connection . in this way , the temperature and green values will be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; additionally , you may set the white off with the list of pre@@ ferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ load resist@@ ator increases the colors if more than a color channel of the pist@@ ons are over@@ exposed . it will be displayed as a pure indicator . this is displayed as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final picture .
&quot; save buttons as well as loading , exactly this . each attitude of the white equivalent you have set you to save to a text file and upload later . &quot;
the button default settings sets all filter values back to their standard values and the associated neutral white comparison . note that there will also be neutral settings a different photo than your original . if you save this change your original image has changed .
&quot; here you can adjust the code of code to the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit coding is the widespread JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high quality images . this coding requires even more record field , calcul@@ ating time and stands for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , T@@ IFF and D@@ NG available . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialogue like the processing of raw pictures . it uses the change and the assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be done through the bottom of color profiles . a detailed manual for the use of color profiles , you can draw the chapter of color administration . &quot;
&quot; another important tool is available in menu in color @-@ value correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner can always make the same mistakes and you will always need the same correction . in the manual for audio correction , you will find further information . &quot;
a very powerful possibility of exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colours gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ance ; General tools of color effects , four colour effects , a solar effect effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter available . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also called Sab@@ ati@@ er , a effect of the picture was created when one partially developed the brigh@@ ter areas of dark and the colors caused by the second lighting . this tool was a partial negative of the image . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar power . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . an additional increase creates a negative picture that is not possible to create phot@@ op@@ le@@ ier . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
the Vi@@ vid filter sim@@ ulates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; -@@ effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation that he has a stronger contra@@ sts that makes the colours brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it easy to emb@@ ell@@ ish many photos .
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an intense color film produced by Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet offers very popular colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as is highly saturated colors in daylight and high contra@@ sts . Vel@@ vi@@ as is highly saturated colors but also some photographs that are hard to li@@ fy and too much .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter sim@@ ulates ne@@ on@@ light on contra@@ sts . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the sli@@ der repet@@ itions the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large pictures , the filter may trigger the whole CPU for a moment . &quot;
&quot; digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to adjust the color con@@ tr@@ ast and the lumin@@ ous intensity of the photos . you can use the different color @-@ bas@@ ements of your photos with the menu below colours . once you are satisfied with the result , use the button O@@ k and you are used . &quot;
if you get a photo at bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem . even in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation can reduce your satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if the result you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex mold Gra@@ dation and the simple leu@@ k@@ starch / contrast / Gamma , the tool is set up to improve the exposure of exposure . even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated , you need only the range of sliding purposes only the range of sli@@ der . more specific the three sli@@ der below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ s are three sli@@ der into which are cli@@ pped and the left side is to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the operation is to shift the control , and make sure how the picture changes . &quot;
&quot; on the right hand , the original and preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , using the settings of the image , update . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
&quot; sc@@ aling : with this box box can be set whether the hist@@ ogram with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis is represented . for pictures of a digital camera , the linear hist@@ ogram is dominated by a single pillar . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic division is useful . &quot;
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the lowest for the middle tones , frequently called Gam@@ ma@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the three color@@ ants can be used in the preview of the original picture in order to automatically adjust the input of the shadow , medium and bright tones . in addition , there is a button for an fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two regulator which can be used to evaluate the output values , for example , the compression ratio can be used as a background while doing something else in the fore@@ ground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set in dependence on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
store as well as loading : these buttons can be saved and uploaded into the file system and later re@@ charged . Gim@@ p levels format is used .
&quot; when you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ p@@ ettes , the input will be automatically adjusted for all sha@@ dows , medium and sunny tones . check the look of the original file for rot@@ - , green , blue and lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ load resist@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and indicate your combined score of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you see an example of the alignment of the procedure applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photos . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original picture is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected image ( 2 ) . &quot;
on the left hand the half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be updated dynam@@ ically depending on your settings . the following options are available :
&quot; Modi@@ fi@@ de channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel , which is altered by the module : &quot;
&quot; in addition to this box , two symbols are located between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for pictures which have been recorded using a digital camera , linear mode provides a wide beam . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode helps . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a spa vent@@ ure@@ head to the right , e.g. the bright sounds , then you can see that these bright sounds are correspon@@ ded with dark gab@@ les and the corresponding images of a dar@@ ker can be dar@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photos is a red mark to see . if you want to change this marker on the section you want to change , you will create a point on this line and move it to and down , until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can make exactly this . every curve you can create with this file system . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; when you use this method and the three colour pi@@ ped buttons automatically generate the control points for all channels of the shadow , mid and sun tones . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curves . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ load indicator control box control all color channels to indicate over@@ exposed pixel . if in more than one channel over@@ loaded pixels , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you &apos;ll get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photograph , which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ anz@@ canal . shadow and Sundays were applied using the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
the canal bl@@ ender of &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color sha@@ des of the photos .
the canal bl@@ ender is another highly developed tool to mix the sha@@ des of the images . you can edit it from the menu of colors @-@ mixer of image processing .
&quot; with the channel optional box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first note how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left section of the window shows you a preview of . the original can be viewed compared to their own rider . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the Target features a red marker . if you move this in the picture , a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram to show you the appropriate color value . &quot;
&quot; the controls for the module are on the right below : regulator for red , green and construction allows you to keep these channels . if you enable L@@ umin@@ ancy , the channel mixer will also be able to enable you to create audio and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black @-@ and @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise that occurs in the colour channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel different . if that &apos;s the case you can reduce your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion to which you can reduce the far@@ brau@@ schen first . &quot;
store as and store buttons are used exactly to this purpose . any mixer adjustment allows you to save and load . this file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the over@@ load resist@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels and indicate your combined score of all channels . here , it is an indicator , that means you get the effect only in the preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see a picture in which the blue channel is re@@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ anz option is stored . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; black / white photography was always fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a working step , as color pictures can be easily converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with a green lens filter . this looks good for all scenarios , and fits particularly well to portraits against heaven . thus similar to the 004 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange film : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , marine scenes and aerial photos . so similar to the 002 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Orange . &quot;
&quot; Rot@@ filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic effects of cel@@ eration and can sim@@ ulate mo@@ on@@ ings for the time of the day . therefore , like the 003 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Rot@@ Filter . &quot;
&quot; yellow filter : sim@@ ulates a black / white film seal with an yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color , and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) yellow filter . &quot;
Sep@@ ul@@ on : create warm and middle tones while he adds a little cold into the sha@@ kes . this is quite similar to the process of a pressure and re@@ development in a sep@@ tic scho@@ oner . this is typical for the pictures of your grandmother and thus similar to the 005 C@@ ok@@ in ( TM ) Sep@@ i@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the di@@ gi@@ ore ; tool texture can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image , ir@@ respective of whether it &apos;s a colour picture or not , you can look like an old master , a pop type portrait of enlarged points or like a wall painting on a wall . the menu entry image texture may apply for it . &quot;
relief : post@@ p@@ one of this parameter to the right increases the length of the depth or three dimensional qualities on the image .
a paper tex@@ tu@@ re@@ ty has been applied on the picture below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the modified ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ore ; tool frames can add a decorative frame , to be added a picture . &quot;
to keep the eye of a viewer in the boundaries of a photos is not easy task . it is a psychological barrier for the scatter@@ ing eye . this is a psychological barrier to the scatter@@ ing eye . under picture frame the module can be started using the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you put the desired frame type for your image . it is thoroughly re@@ covering the picture with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white pictures ) , fli@@ pping it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame which is ideal for a button effect and decor@@ atively adds a decorative frame with pattern . &quot;
width : speci@@ fies the frame of frame in percent . the range of advertising is limited to 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; with the frame available target picture will be bigger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important to print the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can insert simple to form@@ at@@ ted text in an image on any spot . this also goes on several locations if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with the mouse . if you need text size , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its features as you need . at the end , simply dial a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . already the picture is finished . &quot;
&quot; any setting that you have chosen for your text may be changed until you have changed to the button &quot; OK &quot; . after the picture was stored , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed anymore . &quot;
with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; Tool Tem@@ plates allow you to apply a template on a picture .
the menu image Sten@@ cil to apply in the image processing can be used to lay sten@@ cils on a picture .
for the template there are no restrictions concerning the size and orientation . you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should be added with maximum compres@@ sing ( 9 ) to prevent your template &apos;s file size ; simply send an e @-@ mail to the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; mail@@ ing@@ list di@@ gi@@ f @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org ..
&quot; if you use this tool for the first time , you &apos;ll need to set your template folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the templates . these settings are indicated for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder set for the templates , a tree view , which re@@ reflects the folder structure of the template &apos;s folder . the selection of a folder updated the template of template . &quot;
&quot; under the preview there are three buttons , which you can change the magni@@ fication factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this button increases the below picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
shr@@ ink : this button shr@@ inks below the picture below . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to use the template on the whole picture , you must shr@@ ink the picture accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
post@@ p@@ one : use this button to post@@ p@@ one the picture below the template . take the image and place it on the desired position .
please use OK if you want to apply a template on your image . the image will then be adjusted automatically .
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; exhibits three different tools for shar@@ pen@@ ing . each of them has advantages in other areas .
&quot; shar@@ pen@@ ing is a traditional tool for shar@@ pen@@ ing . it is very fast and simple , but , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
Un@@ shar@@ fe mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per . they can use it rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ st and it is a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and he is copy@@ righ@@ ted by Win@@ ston Chang .
&quot; possibly the focus is probably the best of the three , since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation . &quot;
photos without focus as well as most digit@@ ised images need to summar@@ ize . this is due to the dig@@ itali@@ zation process with only minimal differences to a color point . this means that sharp edges may be printed on paper . SLR cameras normally require more retro@@ spec@@ ulation than normal cameras for the private user .
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is frequently used for internal raising . images in the shell format must always be sc@@ anned in the processing format . &quot;
&quot; some scanners use shar@@ pen@@ ing filters already during the reading of the picture . if you dis@@ able this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ing a photo with the shar@@ pen@@ ing value . you can call up with the menu entry fee . &quot;
&quot; but should hereby be careful if the results are not very natural : shar@@ pen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also reinforced the noise . in general , you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too tight . the solution to create a little soft is much easier than it . use the tool to adjust the soft@@ ness with the menu entry , and experiment with you on the right side of the dialogue it shows you the effect on your photo . &quot;
the filter is un@@ sharp m@@ asked is a very good tool to remove veil@@ s from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original picture and the preview can help edit the picture . this show@@ case shows the copy of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should be tried first . an increase of the radius or amount increases the effect . if you make the Un@@ shar@@ fe mask to make the noise and impression of gr@@ ats near sharp edges . &quot;
&quot; the radius determines how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side . high resolution images allow bigger radi@@ ans . they should therefore sharp@@ ens images best in their final resolution . &quot;
&quot; the amount is added to the percentage between the original and the wi@@ red picture , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is placed . &quot;
&quot; the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount . it can therefore define a minimal difference for a edge of filter . in this way , areas with a soft change between tones of shar@@ pen@@ ing and therefore beauti@@ es are avoided in faces , heavens and water surface . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of un@@ sharp filters . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp m@@ asked was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; tool Re@@ focus has focused on a picture of improving the edge . it used the copyright @-@ protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to focus a picture to &amp; quot ; re@@ foc@@ si@@ er@@ quot ; this is better way to sharp@@ ens the photo . this is better than to try the photo . Re@@ focus can usually start better results as un@@ sharp m@@ asked . you can start it out of the menu by clicking using colors Re@@ focus on image processing .
&quot; in practice , the circular f@@ ission work much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ender . the Gau@@ ß &apos;s F@@ ender has a very long tail , which is far from the original distance pixel . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese In@@ verse is influenced by far off the remote pixel . this causes the un@@ wanted results . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular shifting . it is the most important parameters for the use of this module . for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results . you can set up a higher value if your image is very sharp and then in Heiligen@@ sch@@ a .
&quot; correlation : increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . suitable values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase of smoke filter can help you reduce arti@@ facts . however , values are higher than 0.1 but rarely useful . if the noise filter may be too low , and eg ; 0 is very bad . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a useful value is 0.@@ 03 . a useful value is still tigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the Gau@@ ß &apos;s sharp@@ ness . in most cases , you should add this value to 0 to avoid annoying ar@@ te@@ facts . if you use a zero value , you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; die @-@ size : this value determines the size of the transform@@ at@@ rix . an increase in die size can produce good results , especially if you choose large values for the circular code or of the Gau@@ ß . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
&quot; the store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose . any Re@@ focus parameter is set for you to be saved , and then can be charged . &quot;
&quot; try all the cutting , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image . the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible immediately , which leave later un@@ pleasant Ar@@ te@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; if you read pictures and comp@@ ress , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp m@@ asked produces better results than shar@@ pen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ sharp m@@ asked a larger neighborhood than shar@@ pen@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; theore@@ tically , the result of the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter has to be developed . even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lin@@ e@@ are filter . practical , the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters is always at least just as good as the Un@@ shar@@ fe mask . the F@@ IR Vi@@ enn@@ ese filter is frequently better in handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between different filters , on a small unlimited picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp colour image has to be corrected . this picture has been made with an analog camera . the im@@ focused result is due to in@@ sufficient light for the auto focus lens .
&quot; for more information about the methods of shar@@ ec@@ torate in digital images , you may read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
&quot; the regul@@ ators g@@ out , the dis@@ sem@@ ination of the area was dar@@ ken@@ ed , in order to generate a more natural P@@ up@@ ille . &quot;
&quot; the colour inks allows a customized color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can adjust this here . &quot;
&quot; the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools , to remove non @-@ desired Ar@@ te@@ facts combined with unprecedented speed . &quot;
the In@@ painting algorithm has been developed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pre@@ ferences as Star@@ points to simpli@@ fy the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings , you can use the tab cards and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail save p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preser@@ vation of the details . a small value leads to a smooth gl@@ itter about the picture . however , a value of 0.9 should be so preserved , that no shar@@ pen@@ ing should be needed . please note that the details must always be sub@@ ordin@@ ated to the surface dependence . &quot;
&quot; accuracy of Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly into all directions , while a value is close to 1 only in one direction . JPEG arti@@ facts will create a high value of fibre @-@ like pattern . JPEG arti@@ facts will be best with a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ att@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor via all@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , use this value matching the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smooth@@ ed if it is difficult to create the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repet@@ itions : can be run through the algorithm as often . usually 1 or 2 is normally enough .
&quot; angle gradu@@ al da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small to create a long run@@ time . therefore , make sure that small angles should be a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step@@ per cent in pixels . you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the More to quality you receive by selecting this option is only small . it doubles the run@@ time . we recommend it to allow him to leave .
&quot; to store buttons as well as loading , exactly this . any adjustment of image errors can now be saved in a text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; image errors is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can still take a long time and have a high CPU load . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the button crash . &quot;
below you can see how image errors can be removed with small arti@@ facts . the module is used on a photograph found in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you see there is a unique black arti@@ fact that caused by a bad fil@@ en@@ during during the journey . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to exchange graphics . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Peter rear .
&quot; this tool provides selectable image filter to remove st@@ ains and other arti@@ facts which come from dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sens@@ ing from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of single @-@ defined images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need further information about Sensor@@ s@@ wap files from digital cameras , you can read it in this Tut@@ orial English in this Tut@@ orial . &quot;
the picture above shows a typical scene which was made using a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the bottom @-@ window details and the bottom of the advanced settings can stay with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius will be controlled the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 41@@ x@@ 41 ) which is used for the filter . large values increase the time of filters per pixel and can be rot@@ ated through the radius and the colour in it is smooth@@ ed , and thus smaller errors can be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the shar@@ k spac@@ ing . this value sets the pixel distance to the front . if it is increased , noise peaks are deleted . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details may not be preserved and roug@@ h@@ itting or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls the edge of edge for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the response rate of the filter . if it is too strong , the whole space can be removed or noise peaks can occur . put it on a value close to the maxim@@ ums , if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG arti@@ facts without any details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change either color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that controls the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend you either color or lumin@@ ance to change a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that controls the details settings .
&quot; gamma : controls the g@@ amm@@ at@@ oler@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the dar@@ ker areas , which typically become stronger . however , it also shi@@ fted the shadow zones . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controlled the adjustment of the ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ ing absorption . this value defines how quickly the adap@@ tive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges gl@@ atter will appear . if it is high , noise and ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter may appear on the edges . it can remove noise tops and is the recommended method . &quot;
&quot; store up and load : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters on noise reduction , which you have set , can be saved in the file system and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives . the original picture is labeled with ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) , which was used with standard settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to sharp@@ ness the image is very simple than a picture . use these tools to adjust the soft@@ ness with the menu entry , and make the effect on the right side of the dialogue it shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo files .
&quot; this filter for rest@@ oring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of un@@ wanted art@@ e@@ facts of your pictures . it is very well adapted to immer@@ se Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film grain , compres@@ sive art@@ e@@ facts and local mistakes in digital , original or retro@@ spec@@ tively digit@@ ised pictures , and therefore receives the content as it does the human eye . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture . the texture is performed with another tool , the image error correction , performed by the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ dale and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG Ar@@ te@@ facts Redu@@ ce JPEG compression : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas it even generates some compression &amp; quot ; Ar@@ te@@ facts &amp; quot ; - small standards that can be seen in the un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; the buttons store as and store exactly this . each attitude of photo @-@ restoration can hereby be saved in a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo @-@ restoration is compar@@ atively very fast to work . however , it can still take a long time and have a high CPU load . therefore , you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking button . &quot;
&quot; below , you can see how a photo with equ@@ ating noise is gradually reduced .. The module is applied to a black and white photo that using a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( TM ) HP @-@ 5 movie with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO . you can see the not@@ orious film@@ grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and that corrected ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom you can see another example of the photo @-@ restoration . this time tex@@ tures was reduced to an old colour photo , which was used with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were used by the sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and the photo image below ( 1 ) and the correct picture below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; General tools Hot@@ pixel allows the Hot@@ pixel of photos to be removed with a CCD camera , eight were used to use algorith@@ ms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project , which are protected by Martin Dick@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; bright , tot@@ e or hot pixels are a problem with high quality raw material photos a problem because many cameras containing JPEG compression via a built @-@ in supp@@ ression for hot Pixel . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pixels ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wi@@ z@@ ard with the button dark . the tool will detect the hot and bright pixel . these are highlighted in the picture preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important to detect the dark image directly on the connection to discover new hot or bright pixels through CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the appropriate dark picture to the correct picture . an automatic processing of the dark will find the bad pixels . note that the assistant shows the last dark picture and automatically re@@ loads it in the next session . &quot;
the picture section and the preview can be correct to correct the result within the picture shows the copy of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are pointed out in all areas of view .
select an area around the defective pixels at the preview and the results of the filter . choose the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pixel @-@ blocks . these are the available filters :
Dur@@ lo@@ graphy : it is calculated on average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color becomes assigned all def@@ icient pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line .
linear : all pixels have a distance of 1 of the pixel @-@ block ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block is pulled up to calculate an bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate an bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that will then be used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a colour photo , from a faulty digital camera with an sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure to see . the original image has been increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ zation correction is a tool to correct the v@@ ign@@ ments , i.e. sub@@ str@@ ated corners , to correct a picture . &quot;
&quot; wide angle lens , in particular the medium and large photo format , can often reach the entire sensor range instead . instead &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ent quot ; ( sha@@ des ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by putting the light to the sensor there . Tel@@ e@@ Ob@@ jective shows also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but it has also dis@@ advantages . many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 at the bladder filter which should keep the necessary sealing time under circumstances so that it is impossible to keep the camera with the manually . wide angle lens should also be used with center filter , an aper@@ ture of f / 16 or smaller as otherwise un@@ shar@@ pen@@ sive effects arise . &quot;
&quot; using the great exposure areas of today &apos;s film and color or grey @-@ stu@@ ds of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to sim@@ ulate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter to sim@@ ulate the transformation of a c@@ rank filter to an image . the algorithm is protected by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; using three shelves , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction filter and with three further exposure of the target picture . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of lighting strength at the point of the highest density of the filter . the default density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate the density to compens@@ ate for a greater degree of Vig@@ net@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; leu@@ k@@ starch , contrast and gamma settings : editing a picture with the v@@ ign@@ ant correction reduces the lumin@@ ous intensity of the pixel . you need to re @-@ adjust the exposure of the target picture with these options . the controllers must only increase positive values since you need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a fine re @-@ adjustment of the target image , so let the values for lumin@@ ance / contrast / gamma with zero and use the gra@@ dation of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; image processing from the menu color Gra@@ dation . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ fying correction for a picture . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the v@@ ign@@ ant image in the corners and ( 2 ) the correct picture , and a contrast correction was also performed in the image with this tool . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; lens dist@@ ortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geomet@@ ric dist@@ ortion . colour dist@@ ortion can not be corrected using this tool .
&quot; the coefficient of the second degree is treated with geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion of the lens , and can correct the con@@ cave or con@@ v@@ wit@@ ch form of the image . &quot;
&quot; the third @-@ degree coefficient has a similar round effect , but fl@@ att@@ ened to the edges . this correction is not used in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient &apos;s fourth degree correc@@ ts the distant corners to the second degree . if you combine these two , any geomet@@ rical dist@@ ortion is almost eliminated . &quot;
&quot; General : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion second degree . with negative values can be corrected and positive values de@@ c dist@@ ortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the dist@@ ortion channel . this value controls the edges of the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenti@@ ls , the &apos; corners parameters have the re@@ marked mark of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value is sc@@ aled the image size and performs a correction in the first degree . negative values increase during positive the picture .
&quot; brigh@@ test : this value adjustment the brightness in the corners of the picture . negative values reduce the brightness of the picture in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialogue with a preview of decl@@ aring correction . values which you use for your image are stored and the next start is used as standard values . &quot;
&quot; the tonn@@ e or k@@ ho@@ stage correction should be carried out prior to all delivery or size changes . preferably lead to this correction as all first . if you want to re @-@ edit a picture , and then add a tonn@@ e @-@ shaped correction would be the effect of the wrong factor . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool is a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea edge or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . afterwards , you can correct the tonn@@ e / k@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic dist@@ ortion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you have a ho@@ ver@@ bed dist@@ ortion , the resulting image can have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the menu transformer cut from the image processing or the zoom regulator of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most pictures , the tonn@@ e correction is sufficient . the next logical step for some moti@@ ves like photos of the front , frame and paintings , it &apos;s the perspective so correct to correct the camera with the hand you &apos;ll always have a slight dist@@ ortion of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the tonn@@ age correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to sim@@ ulate the infrared film of the Gim@@ p &apos;s website , which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( TM ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ ar@@ ot@@ ion , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the range for the preview . if you move the red rectangle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
below the preview you can adjust two parameters set movie clips and footage sensitivity when you want to sim@@ ulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator is changing the amount of film grain and the domin@@ ance of the colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in converting . green meadows will be white like snow !
&quot; because the filters paint channels to produce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the colour formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of infrared fil@@ let applied to a landscape photo of New Zealand . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values create a kind of au@@ ra in the washers .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; filter film equipment is an easy @-@ to @-@ use tool to re@@ produce screen@@ ings on your pictures , such as the B / W Ko@@ dak Tr@@ i @-@ X , known to enhance the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturer of large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film effect aspect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move into the past . if you want to get a tim@@ eless atmosphere lo@@ osed from everyday life . if you want to see this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographer , gra@@ ined sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , so you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the control kno@@ b the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the Kör@@ ner . the default value is , although frequently higher values are required , at ISO @-@ 2400 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of film tables to be applied on a black / white image . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and that worked the ( 2 ) , which used film sensitivity to ISO @-@ 1600 . &quot;
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting creates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and styles are good for that effect .
&quot; there are two regulator to influence this effect . the upper one cho@@ oses the brush size between one and five . th@@ icker brushes are better suited for large pictures . smooth controls the gl@@ are or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil paintings effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and that is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and gl@@ are 17 .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter carbon drawing uses colour and intensity gra@@ dient to create a coal t@@ ad . therefore , images of their gra@@ dients are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ etch . these would have good pictures to start with it . &quot;
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators with a range of 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper control is elec@@ ts the pin size and the lower control is the contrast ( smooth ) . &quot;
this is an example of the charcoal filter . the original picture ( 1 ) and the modified image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 have been used . the result can be improved by adjust@@ ing the intensity value .
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engraving shaped your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was marked in wax , using a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works especially well with images with a simple structure , in which color does not use the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ ary landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
&quot; with this filter group , you can transform a normal photograph in a work of art by means of separation . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
wave blocks 1 : divide the picture in cells and it will look like if it is seen through glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : analog@@ ous to the wave blocks 1 the image is dist@@ orted here with another version of glass blocks .
some effects require long time to calculate and generate a high CPU load . you can stop this effects at any time with the kno@@ cking button .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photograph in a work of art using un@@ shar@@ fe effects . it uses copyright protected algorith@@ ms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; Zoom Un@@ shar@@ ks : wi@@ ping the image along the st@@ ern@@ able lines run from a central point . this sim@@ ulates a zo@@ oming camera , thereby creating a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography . &quot;
radi@@ al non@@ shar@@ ks : wi@@ ped out the picture by rotation of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the dis@@ course of one rotating camera .
distances : wi@@ ped out the picture to produce the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back in the background .
&quot; motion detector : wi@@ ped out the picture by horizontal movements of the pixel . this sim@@ ulates the in@@ shar@@ ks of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photograph@@ ing , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft tip : wi@@ ped the picture soft@@ ly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ aming and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portrait , gl@@ amour @-@ photos or for adding a warm and subtle light . &quot;
Sag@@ itt@@ arius : wi@@ ped out the image by random shifting of pixels and sim@@ ulates the in@@ firm@@ ity of an arbitr@@ ary moving camera .
intelligent Un@@ shar@@ ks : find the colors in the picture and wi@@ ped out this without the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : divide the photo in rectangular cells , and then created it through the col@@ t with an average Pix@@ um value . &quot;
some effects require long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can break this calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking button .
the rain@@ drops are a nice little tool to make Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ ath on your picture . this makes it natural your pictures a wet look . it uses a Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyright protected algorithm .
dri@@ p size allows to change the size of the drops . because the dri@@ p size is not growing automatically with the size of the picture it is often necessary to decrease size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish au@@ ctions changes the visual effect of the drop in the picture .
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing a range free of rain@@ drops . use the tool for example to choose the area , e.g. a face , which should remain free . if you then start the filter out of the shelf , the area will remain free of rain@@ drops . &quot;
this is an example of rain@@ drops Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset over a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through sk@@ e@@ wers or turning into the right orientation . the tools are available in the menu , rotating and transformer . &quot;
photo @-@ blowing is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo to a minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; a picture of shr@@ ink is simple . the big question is , how can you find an image and watch the details ? how can you find the missing information or guess ? the C@@ im@@ g @-@ Algorith@@ m is used here , makes it a good job here . try him and you &apos;ll see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo is the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select the size change in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is visible below . &quot;
&quot; the tool to size change is a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method , to enhance the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
many educational programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm has been developed from the IM@@ AGE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ im@@ g project .
you need to tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New Size and are listed below :
&quot; adjust the aspect ratio : when this setting is enabled , the new size will maintain the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter affects bigger structures . the higher this value is set , the more becomes smooth@@ ed if it is difficult to create the geomet@@ ry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons store as well as loading , the buttons can be used as text file . each single inser@@ tion can be saved as text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo @-@ blowing is very fast with what it does , but it can still take a long time and take a high CPU load . you can break the calculation at any time with the kno@@ cking button . &quot;
you can see below an example for photo blowing as a small colour image has been enlarged to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 2 ) is the result of linear standard magni@@ fication .
&quot; the cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . in order to cut a photo just the rectangle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rectangle , then you &apos;ll see this rectangle , then you will see the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you leave the mouse button again , the area of the photos is cut off . by doing so you can change a good overview as your photo after cutting edge . you can pull the size of the territory by removing the corners of the rectangle . a new rectangle , simply create with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button The Zu@@ cut @-@ button of the image processing in the tool@@ bar and the photo will be used ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file Save or File Save under the File menu to save the newly designed photo . &quot;
&quot; in the review area , you can change the size of the rectangle by shifting the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio , which you have defined in the dialog . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format , the greater value of the height and in the cross format is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio is a relative aspect ratio . that means it is always equal to whether you use centi@@ meters , In@@ ch , or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog there exist two buttons around the selection automatically , horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog you can set with the Max . button kno@@ b the range for cutting to the wid@@ est possible , depending on selected relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool according to aspect ratio stores its settings depend on the image orientation ( Horizont@@ al or Ver@@ tical ) . if you are using the accessory tool , these settings are stored as standard values in the EX@@ IF tables , so the EX@@ IF data will reflect the customized image and not the original picture . &quot;
help settings make it better for help to send your pictures better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ious particles are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third par@@ agus , harmon@@ ious triangles have an opportunity to share a rectangle in similar harmon@@ ious triangles , facing the diagonal . &quot;
&quot; golden Middle : the golden middle is a partition which is based on various natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nauti@@ lus shell or the flower leaves of a sunflower . it appears in all possible things we find as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the r@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by the old Egyptians and Greeks , who thus use their temples and pyr@@ am@@ ids . artists and architects have used the golden pitch in all times when you create your pictures , buildings and even photos taken to give your cre@@ ations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . , where each number is equal to 1 : 1,@@ 6@@ 18 the golden @-@ middle . a composition that rule will follow as a vis@@ ually harmon@@ ious . &quot;
the golden center provides lique@@ fied aux@@ iliary lines when you set an image below . these aid will be listed below :
&quot; the golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . in comparison to the third par@@ agus , the golden spiral can follow a smooth line of the eye through the picture . this type of composition leads the view of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called gold rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles should be used to make the golden spiral . it can be a line or different objects . this can be easily accessible without the eye , it will fulfil its task . &quot;
&quot; the golden triangles are also diver@@ ted from the above mentioned golden spiral . its ver@@ tex points are the middle points of the golden rectangle . note that , unlike harmon@@ ious triangles , golden triangles have no is@@ os@@ cel@@ es triangles . diagonal to place a static object to be more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles in order to break your frame for your frame . try to place your photo focus on one of the cutting points and other visual information in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition you can &apos;t reach .
&quot; the options are mir@@ ro@@ red and vertically , in order to mirror harmon@@ ious particles . &quot;
&quot; with the button color you can set the colour of the aux@@ iliary lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aux@@ iliary lines can be invisible . this type allows you to custom@@ ize the color of the lines your current picture . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate a picture of every angle .
&quot; if you do a photo then it happens easily to keep the camera vertical or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture where the things are rot@@ ated by an angle . you can fix it with the &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; image processing and the tool @-@ free rotation . select the free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image with the sliding angle . the values on this sli@@ der are given in degrees . with the button default , you can reset the slide back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture will be displayed on the right side . &quot;
&quot; to help your help the module is open a horizontal and a vertical line . move the mouse poin@@ ter to position the two lines . after you have a pressure on the left mouse button . now , adjust the angle as described in the previous section . &quot;
after you have shot a picture you will find un@@ wanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . possibility of repair it is to use the function transform@@ ers from the image processing .
a more elegant way to slice the picture is auto @-@ cutting function . select one of the following options :
the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the picture a bit after the rotation . but note the above warning .
all per@@ spec@@ tively transform@@ ations are performed in a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
&quot; to change the perspective , you need to use the red squares at corners of your image . the preview will then be calculated automatically . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective : &quot;
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : displays the current angle in degrees on the upper left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees on the upper right corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower left corner of the transformed territory .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees on the lower right corner of the transformed territory .
&quot; after adjust@@ ing the perspective the picture becomes a bit wor@@ m@@ ated . for single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ t@@ ations produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have made the perspective , you get the tri@@ angular tri@@ angular holes on the corners . one way to clean this is the picture with transform@@ ers cutting out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to move a part of the image in a direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotating , the picture will be dist@@ orted to the left . with other words , a rectangle will be transformed into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can launch this module about transform@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; shoot your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can adjust horizontal and vertically at the same time . if you put on default , the angle to zero are displayed and the new dimensions of the target picture will be displayed on the right of the predic@@ tive area . &quot;
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line has been installed . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now adjust the button tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have carried out the coating , the picture will be a bit twi@@ sted . for a single loop , this effect is usually negli@@ gible , but two ch@@ ings are compens@@ ated twice as much los@@ se and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after dra@@ ining , the painting has un@@ pleasant tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one possibility to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transform@@ ers from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write them . the available formats are therefore depend on your system and , in some cases , from the kind like these libraries . in most distri@@ butions , you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; &quot;
&quot; due to the depen@@ dency of other libraries , it is impossible to provide a list of all file formats available on this site . but they will always find JPEG and T@@ IFF under it . &quot;
&amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; shows only files in formats to the knows . this is done using the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . you can change this list of file expansion and di@@ gi@@ gi@@ ated ; you can change this list of file expansion ; you can find out more information in this section .
almost all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JPEG or T@@ IFF . some cameras do not allow you to use it to use format . a detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression method on digital pictures . redund@@ ant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . in general , there are better , smooth results than JPEG at the same compression ratio . the 200@@ 0s can also save los@@ s@@ less if this is specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw file format , you can read about Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful pi@@ res in English . you can find raw format images in JPEG or T@@ IFF with the raw image converter ; you can find further information about the use of modules with &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; &quot;

many tools you need the photo editing are in &amp; di@@ gi@@ ous ; included . their description follows here .
&quot; all work processing tools such as shar@@ pen@@ ing , so@@ iling , cat@@ ching , focus , un@@ sharp m@@ asked , &amp; etc . use a uniform dialogue before the filter is applied to the actual picture . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture user quot ; in this dialogue : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the area . these modes are :
vertically without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left section shows the original and the right controls the filter applied to the right of the selected section area .
&quot; horizontal parts without dup@@ lic@@ ates , the upper section shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected section area . &quot;
vertically . the left section shows the original and the right to comparison the effect of the filter .
&quot; horizontal parts . the upper section shows the original , lower , lower than the effect of the filter . &quot;
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : shows the preview of the mouse , not in the front area and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch off to display over@@ - and under@@ bel@@ i@@ ation . they can be adapted to the general installation page .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for a selection of preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image , and on the part of the image , from which you want to see the preview of the dialog is now updated . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) : in the left corner , here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all adjust@@ ing of the last use of the module are noted . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar features features the essential information about the selected image , and is largely explained . it is group@@ ed by the following sections : &quot;
photo characteristics : shows a summary of the most important parameters in the shooting of the photos . these data are from the EX@@ IF data if they are available .
this rider presents an intu@@ iti@@ que c@@ ens@@ or tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ ature program . you can print it out using the mouse wheel or put it out and put it out . if you are using the mouse button . all images within this coordinates are filtered and indicated . of course , this requires your pictures Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; is an editor for pall@@ ets files . the application can be used to edit paint pall@@ ets and expressions of colors .
&quot; pall@@ ets files installed by &amp; K@@ DE ; can be installed either for the whole system or only one user . in the latter case they are in your personal folder for &amp; K@@ DE ; settings and hot user defined colours and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pall@@ ets or browse the folder to files . &quot;
the cur@@ sor is displayed as a line in the pal@@ let . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
it shows the color next to it . the colour is described under the pal@@ let view . here also the colour name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to select . in order to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cur@@ sor position . afterwards , you move the mouse at pressed lin@@ king mouse . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is inserted under the button color , the colour is inserted from the colour plate at the cur@@ sor . the color will either be inserted or over@@ write a different ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode allows you to adjust the check box under the cur@@ sor . &quot;
&quot; a selection , which was created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and insert . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color followed three values for the shares of red , green and blue and an optional color name , followed by another color . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as one color in &amp; col@@ col@@ ore@@ dit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the list of colour selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select one color anywhere on the screen and then click on the left side on the left .
&amp; graphic graph ; is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ dot ; -@@ graph@@ s . graph@@ s are available in science , especially in computer science ; so far there &apos;s no modern &amp; GUI ; the programs that include graph@@ s ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; - programs with just a few functions . &quot;

&quot; other required software : &amp; K@@ DE ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ program , which require the &amp; graphic ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of the graph@@ s required . are required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graph@@ s , each in its own display window . at the beginning , if you start &amp; k@@ graphical ; without an argument , the main window will open only the symbol file and the ( empty ) list are added files . Click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after you have chosen one or more &amp; dot , the main window looks like in the lower frame photo : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner will be displayed if the Graph is bigger than the character surface . you can select a fixed position of this overview or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special keys , left and right with supp@@ ressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by a factor of 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file has just changed in &amp; k@@ graphical ; loaded file from another program , the following window is displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can select whether the Graph is to be re@@ loaded , or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to ignore the change , you can also want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu option for graphical , set up ... see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph outside of an ongoing &amp; k@@ graphical ; -@@ Trial open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ graphical ; -@@ instance open or to show the loading Graph@@ s in a sub @-@ window of the current instance . &quot;
&quot; as in the last option , you can store your choice permanently , but can also be retro@@ spec@@ tively later with the dialog dialog . &quot;
at the program start you can open all graph@@ s of your last session . again you can save your choice either as well as later .
&quot; you can also define how the graph is to be divided on several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph@@ s , which are to be comp@@ lied to one side , the aspect ratio will be ignored . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not appear from the respective parts of the graph@@ s . &quot;

&quot; the site again load the possibility to determine behavior if a file has changed on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can design@@ ate a default behavior ( automatically re@@ load or ignore the changes ) or the program every time . &quot;
&quot; the page is possible to determine the behaviour of &amp; k@@ graphical ; stuck when a graph is opened outside a current session . you can open a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ s in a new window , or in a window of the current session ) or determine that each time is required . &quot;
the site seat management gives the ability to determine the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graphical ; determine . you can open a standard behavior ( the files of the last session or not ) or determine immediately at each start .
&quot; the context menu , usually in one click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; appears , further options opens : &quot;
here you can choose among various &amp; graphic algorith@@ ms ; layout algorith@@ ms choose . entries as shown on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; are :

the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization allows GPS coordinates to add and edit GPS coordinates to be able to add and edit the geographical data in the EX@@ IF sequence of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for ge@@ ographic loc@@ alization provides tools to loc@@ alize images geograph@@ ically in the spher@@ ical coordin@@ ate system , used by GPS and Galil@@ eo , used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with ge@@ ographic data , you need a GPS track than XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ b@@ abel and g@@ ps@@ man can download the data for you from your GPS device . &quot;
image Ge@@ ograph@@ ical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of pre @-@ selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the pictures you want to cor@@ relate to the main window and call up the menu . of course , you &apos;ll need to load a track file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains the data stored at the same locations , as the pictures of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation was performed , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS track data will be recorded at GMT time and therefore must be carried out with the time zone . this can be done using the time zone . &quot;
&quot; the default setting for the maximum time devi@@ ation is a lower devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera inspection . if the devi@@ ation is included , the data will be merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have any track data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the pictures . the difference of 2000 seconds is then cor@@ related to all pictures in this area .
&quot; the options Inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you have no appropriate data . if you know that in reality a location of difference between camera and GPS is , you can set these limits here and then cor@@ relate to the button . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog can use the coordinates of a call to the next notice , you just need to use the button OK to set the data from the actual photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found with the displayed map according to and after being found . select this again by , until you reach a reaching accuracy . the card can always be selected manually . the card can be changed manually , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are possibilities to mount GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool is used to stack a stack of images using GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums than HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums in a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are exported to HTML pages , and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is encoded as UTF @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the module has four riders in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums . you will not need these albums on the right , you will quickly choose a large number of albums . in the area , the Al@@ ben@@ vor@@ schau and the text will appear in the head of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the tab features the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely expl@@ aining a page in which each image will display a new page . if you then click on a picture , a new page is displayed directly with your default viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show , displayed . &quot;
&quot; the tab defined the settings where and how the gallery with all your associated images should be saved . select a folder from which you write permission . a sub@@ folder with the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with other colour depth , you can change the default colour depth . naturally , the file size is also explained . all other settings are even explained . &quot;
&quot; the riders feature allows you some of the settings from the album rider for the th@@ umb@@ nails , these are small pictures displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user that the action is how far the action is . press off to break the process .
&quot; if the module creates the pages , the window is not automatically closed . you can therefore read the program messages to determine if the error occurred during the creation . the web browser is automatically started to preview the preview of the Gallery . press S@@ ing to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer is a very quick and flexible Open@@ GL based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I picture viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . the viewer can be used with short commands and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , a picture is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed in a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG L@@ oss@@ less module is a tool to change images without impact your quality .
&quot; this module allows you to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses on quality and met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is the file size , since there is no compression of colour formations . this is also found at the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client is a tool that you can connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera @-@ client has not currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module Metad@@ ata Editor has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; using the import function of the met@@ ad@@ ata module , you can copy data from one image to another . then select the file menu dialog with which you want to copy the dialog box with which you want to copy the met@@ ad@@ ata . the data will be copied after the button OK . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy them from anywhere , but not in any target format . JPEG is supported by writing . please look at@@ iv@@ 2 to see what formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG Ko@@ di@@ erer module is a tool to convert a series of pictures into a MPEG video in form of a Di@@ vor@@ au .
&quot; the MPEG Ko@@ di@@ mer module can be used to convert selected pictures into a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick . you can also add a audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of the Di@@ vor@@ au . &quot;
all images are automatically sc@@ aled on the correct size for the selected video format . in addition you can use a background colour for the Di@@ vor@@ au . with this module it is possible to create DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / VCD for your DVD player . you can only use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you must first select the images that are packed into MPEG Di@@ vor@@ au . afterwards , you can create the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ vor@@ au . &quot;
the pictures of selected pictures are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting to the pictures or the content of the list .
&quot; after you are pleased with your list , you should adapt the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and VCD . PAL is pre@@ set and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds . the speed of the picture is defined below . a lower value creates very sudden , a high , very smooth finish . &quot;
&quot; the background colour can be set to be next . in doubt , you should let it be black . you can define the name and path of the generated file under the name of the MPEG @-@ output file . as if possible , you keep your extension . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the film . after your computer &apos;s settings you can start with the button . depending on your computer &apos;s speed , you can now take a coffee or enjoy the thick@@ ly when you return . &quot;
&quot; if a hint appears that Ko@@ di@@ erer or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ p@@ eg@@ Tools and Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick packages across the button on the right below . &quot;
the print assistant allows you to print more pictures on a sheet of paper together in standard Photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also be opened automatically with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to print you or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct expression .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import and convert your files stored in one of three formats JPEG , T@@ IFF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command @-@ set tool d@@ cra@@ w of Dave Coff@@ in . a original quote from Him is : do not expect the same results as the software from your camera controllers . sometimes you get d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
first select the RA@@ W file that should be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image . with the button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be util@@ ised . the main parameters such as gamma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can continue to process the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected to use the contra@@ cting information . if your camera is working in RGB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are happy with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save it . the fil@@ en@@ ame remains the same , and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a low @-@ loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged Image format , T@@ IFF , ret@@ ains all the information of your image and use the los@@ s@@ less L@@ Z@@ W compres@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format , since it only has a limited number of operations . T@@ IFF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG as a storage format , the met@@ ad@@ ata is stored in the RA@@ W file in the EX@@ IF file . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted your settings , you can restart the conversion . if you want to break down the process again , you can use this process again . &quot;
&quot; the launching mode allows you to convert different pictures at once . use this mode therefore , if you are sure , for example , by testing on a single image that &apos;s the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have to write the possibility of existing file automatically . this is helpful if these have been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is however not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in an album . it uses the program convert from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the text may be used . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the standard program from the Ima@@ ge@@ Mag@@ ick package . you can reduce the image size by size or increase the image change :
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . width or height of the picture is automatically selected depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . here the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio will be changed at this option .
&quot; pre@@ preparation : prepar@@ es the picture for the photo print . the user can set the printing solution and the size of the photo display . the target picture , including background size , boundary size and background colour , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the additi@@ ve pictures before . further pictures can move on the list of images to cut images and place there . &quot;
after having started the module you will display the pictures window with the displayed pictures displayed . you can add some pictures using a file @-@ selection dialog . for the last modified image will be displayed a preview on the right side .
you can also draw pictures on the image list and add it to the list of images added to the list of images .
&quot; with the button to remove images , the selected pictures from the list of images are removed . &quot;
after you have selected all pictures you can open the new message to your e @-@ mail clients using the button OK . you just need to add the addresses and subject to the subject . those of your selected pictures are already added .
don &apos;t pay attention to many pictures at once . most of the e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send several mails if you want to send many pictures .
the E @-@ Mail window is used to change the settings for the end of the images . their configuration is stored and every time you use it again until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the command field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you have to install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the comments in a modified file , comments on the images are joined together and put together the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format among the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted under the los@@ s@@ less formats such as T@@ IFF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG pictures of file format and file the original files in JPEG format , then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ data are added to the larger images . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can watch the status reports , where you can watch . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button , you can narrow this window . &quot;
&quot; after starting the module advanced Di@@ asch@@ au , a window with questions such as you want to see your Di@@ vor@@ au . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL @-@ trans@@ itions option activ@@ ates very elegant image processes using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphics card , otherwise the le@@ ak@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
&quot; the fil@@ en@@ ames option ensures that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images are displayed in the left , while the presentation is displayed . &quot;
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an end loop . you can then break it manually with Es@@ c .
&quot; the images , random@@ ly select images , make sure the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not used the sequence of images in the album . &quot;
&quot; in delay between the pictures may be placed between the pictures . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your calcul@@ ator and the selected transition effects . you should test it before you show your friends ! &quot;
there are more than a dozen trans@@ itional effects between which you can choose . random@@ ly choose from any transition between the pictures another effect .
&quot; during the Di@@ asch@@ au , you can access a tool@@ bar on the top left screen edge . move the mouse to this corner by you . &quot;
&quot; with this tool bar , you can keep the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and next picture and stop the Di@@ vor@@ au . &quot;
&quot; on the left lower screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently not documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I teams under K@@ DE @-@ Imag@@ ing @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. please note : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module with background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the desktop .
&quot; this module sets the current selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menus , as the background for your K@@ DE work area . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; photo album ; by these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see by a comparison with the image are now available in each group , i.e. in people , places and in group sample entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you see the categories that you have given information as you have entered your pictures and videos with notes . in addition , there are entries to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course the current pre@@ views . in the following , each for itself is described . &quot;
&quot; if you push the mouse on the entry , change the browser &apos;s view . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the pictures are displayed , on which both people are visible . by this selection method , you can limit the number of images from a few thousand pictures on a few single images . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can view with th@@ umb@@ nails , to view the images of your search engine . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same symbol before your name . you can save with &amp; photo album ; however , for each person a separate image , which also applies to places , keywords and other categories that you themselves have defined . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the names , select the button you can choose right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the original context menu , you can select which you can display for each category . it has the advantage that you can display symbols with images of people and at the same time a list of keyword sub@@ titles ( if you don &apos;t have a suitable picture ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must determine which image for each individual should be displayed . to do this , you &apos;ll need to select the image command window ( in closer ) and select the picture file for the appropriate person . you can select the thum@@ b factor according to your wishes and select which portion of the image will be displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re looking for searching in the main window , you will find a dialog box showing the dialog for the image properties very similar . this dialog can be seen on the picture again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the field lab@@ eling or description , the labelling and descriptions of the pictures are searched after this text ; for example , the date can be either a part of the total date , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window you can browse all the pictures by certain names , as you can see in the picture . here , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; photo album ; if you don &apos;t like to read manu@@ als , but rather want to try hand@@ books , you prefer the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; photo album ; and watch the quick @-@ up , the screen pictures and the introduc@@ tory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; photo album ; and in the first dialog you start the demo , or select your photo album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu print photo album ; -@@ Demo . then , some example pictures are loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; photo album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , please find it on the homepage of &amp; photo album ; as an associated HTML @-@ file to download . &quot;
&quot; at the lower edge of the main window of &amp; photo album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this glue you see here : as the name suggests , this Lei@@ ste will show you data statistics about the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display you several different time units . each glue shows a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by showing the bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the Tim@@ eline can use you in the following ways : you can change the displayed entries from the database ( if you select a date , you &apos;ll find the first image of this date in the preview page ) and also shows the current date of the currently displayed images , when you navigate in the preview page . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by pressing the mouse button , and mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so the time data . when you select a range , you will click the selection only pictures of this period . you can click the selection by clicking on a bar of the bar . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; introduces you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . it is integrated in &amp; photo album ; integrated and the other as module available ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual is described in &amp; photo album ; built in the following part of the user interface that you can create via the menu File ...
&quot; before HTML pages , you need to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , every area is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the transfer and a description , which should contain the HTML file later . on a photo album ; HTML example page , you see an example for these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , choose whether a &amp; photo album ; -@@ export file should be created on the review page . check out information about export files you will find in . &quot;
&quot; last@@ ly , you can select which information on the HTML pages are to be displayed . thus , you can avoid that any pictures are displayed on the viewer . for example , you can &apos;t use any pictures . you can &apos;t use this attitude to hide certain pictures before certain ways . &quot;
&quot; in this area you can define how the HTML pages should look like . most of the site possibilities are clear , which is why it is not received in particular . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can adjust different resolutions for images . by doing so , those who have to consider your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x@@ 600 , no pictures you can download for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer can change the resolution at any time you have set the resolution . so , it can get your pictures with a lower resolution , as well as if he wants to get a picture larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this installation area , you place the different folder and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select for all your HTML files a basic folder and for each subsequent sentence a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder , where all your pictures are stored . this folder is stored and you can select for all future pictures . here you can either choose a folder or one of K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check if this is really all visible for viewers . if you have created a URL for the base folder , the URL you should set here should be this folder . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; in the case that the HTML files are not in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them . thus , the import function , see , properly , you must specify the final destination of files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the basic folder in which all sub @-@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the options described above have all three basic folders or UR@@ Ls . in these , a sub@@ folder will be created , whose name you define in output file . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking at a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , you may want to create your pictures with these images . of course , you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures , and you may need to add a HTML page to the pictures , recording location , etc . &quot;
you can import a copy of your pictures into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import a copy of your pictures into your database . the image properties are imported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ if the pictures are stored in the file or whether in the file is just a link to pictures . the advantage may have all the images into the file . the obvious down@@ side is however the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can export a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu file Export ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file along with an HTML file , this will create an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file search for the images in double way . first , it is searching for the images that have indicated in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . of course , the pictures of the URL , you are searched for creating your .@@ k@@ im file using HTML @-@ export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , dialogue for export images are described , which you can export via the File menu . &quot;
the most important option of this dialogue is whether it should take internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . there are the following three selection options available :
&quot; when you copy the manual , to the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures into the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy the Autom@@ atically to copy the .@@ k@@ im file copying &amp; photo album ; the pictures automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most of the pictures have been compressed using JPEG and the XML file itself is normally worth to comp@@ ress files . if you want to comp@@ ress this anyway , just select the export file . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum image size limit . if you send your friends pictures , you may not want to send the pictures in full size because the .@@ k@@ im file is otherwise very large . here you can say that each picture should be 800 pixel wide and wide . &quot;
if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu File Imp@@ orting ... is used to import &amp; photo album ; the exported database as described in .
&quot; the assistant to imports consists of four steps . first you need to select which images you would like to import , then , in which folder the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it can be that you are looking for the category person to be imported ( if you are a Dan@@ e ) , while this category is needed in your database . therefore , you are asked in the third dialogue window , which are to be imported in the third dialog box , which equ@@ ates to these categories in your database . &quot;
&quot; in fourth step , you can see the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example for this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be simple to browse pictures and look : if you look at pictures , you want to view images in different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you are looking for pictures of your Italy holiday , you might want to see pictures with your friend , you may see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find the different steps of ( 1 ) capture the information about your pictures , via ( 2 ) the searches and respect to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ t@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Photo@@ Album was started as a program to manage your pictures . however , it has been extended and today your videos will take care of . in many places this manual is spoken about images , but frequently also includes videos with one . &quot;
&quot; store &amp; photo album ; stores all its information in the inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml file in the top folder of their images . this is a simple XML file , which you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ male backup tools , copying on a flo@@ ppy or revisions in the CV@@ S . &quot;
&quot; &amp; photo album ; not@@ ices the folder stored in which your pictures are stored and uses this in future start automatically . if you want to start a different folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start &amp; edit photo album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : photo album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
over the menu entry settings can be set up ; set up ... enter into a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; photo album ; in the following section of user manual are explained to you the various setup possibilities .
&quot; to the left you can see six different symbols , with which you can call for the viewer &apos;s preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting is an exhau@@ st@@ ive help to call the F1 key and click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it was described to you as you can set for each image different features , such as characters , places and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; see the dialog that is used to work already existing groups . for each existing group , you can choose a lab@@ eling and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ categories were already mentioned in the section options . in dialogue options , you can set entire member groups , e.g. all members of a group at once in a group , instead of all groups of a mid@@ range . &quot;
&quot; in view of the installation options , which are available to you with the members of the member groups . you can configure the category you want to configure . in the left window , you can choose a list with the current category and in the right list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&amp; photo album ; spl@@ its his module system with other graphics applications such as di@@ gi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; K@@ DE ; image Plug@@ in interface . contact information can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi .
&quot; the modules can be accessed via the module . the modules can be described and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; photo album ; but most modules have a help @-@ page that you can use over the module itself . &quot;
&quot; as the modules used by multiple applications can be used together , it may be that the modules are tested with &amp; photo album ; just before you can upgrade them on your own pictures . therefore , you can either call it on your own pictures with the command &gt; c@@ photo@@ album -@@ Demo &lt; user@@ input \ &gt; or over the menu Help . don &apos;t say , I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; photo album ; not work . this is the down@@ side if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; photo album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can be added to albums : this is an album simply a folder . even if &amp; W photo album ; this type of order is not supported , sim@@ ulates the features with &amp; photo album ; you can use it for some modules . &quot;
&quot; sim@@ ulated &amp; photo album ; the current album , which is simply the current view , so all the pictures that look at the picture shows . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , the photo album must be handed over ; the modules also includes a list of albums . it goes on the photo album ; as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; W photo album ; s browser shows the contents of a category , for example , every person , then every entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category you have set up in the setting dialog as category for virtual albums , so if you &apos;re using the category persons , you will have a photo album ; so do so if you have selected persons to view and the module will continue . &quot;
&quot; there are some modules with &amp; W photo album ; not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . start the setup dialog and select modules , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of a start screen , as soon as you start your photo album ; start with your own images . &quot;
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you see the top of a menu bar and a tool bar . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window that you can &apos;t have any information about your pictures . in the section we will display at this window , now please click on the entry pictures , which shows you an overview of all existing images . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of &amp; photo album ; is the possibility to see each image with notes . this includes information about the persons appearing on the picture where the picture was taken , etc . you can use each image either individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . for example , on all the pictures of Jes@@ per is pictured and all the pictures taken in Copenhagen . &quot;
all these notes can be used for searching and brows@@ ing as you can read in the section . if you want to see this remark if you are using the built @-@ in viewer .
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by setting people , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; photo album ; as you can always use it again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to shift the images within the list : if you are depicted for example a family party and shown on all 50 frames the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can find that the use of the names are moved upwards to the people faster and arrange them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer a alphabetical list of alphabetical list , please click on the symbol for sorting on the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have chosen notes on each image individually , you may want to edit all selected pictures and have these images with notes . in this case simply click on the front and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture right above . &quot;
&quot; if you have several pictures , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more comfortable to mark all of these pictures and to use the menu option more ere entries to use with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all in the USA . there are also San Francisco and Los Angeles in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window of the USA as a trans@@ group . to show you that it is a group , there will be a special symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the tab @-@ dialog@@ s it is possible to add an entry into an existing or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also submit an entry to a category and place there to browse this to a sub@@ category of this entry . attention , this assumes that you can sort or sort your categories of alphabetical list . &quot;
&quot; you can post@@ p@@ one the individual elements of the tab dialog@@ s by shifting the outer edge of the frames , click on and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make a separate window by making it out of the window area . &quot;
&quot; if you have adapted the appearance of the window to your needs , you &apos;re satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... , which offers you the possibility to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also leave a frame completely completely . if you want to see this window again later , use the button options ... and then window a / out . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry images in the browser , you &apos;ll get an overview of images of the currently selected images , or all the images if you do not have a filter . for example , you can see the size of the th@@ umb@@ nails , by simply plug@@ ging down the mouse with the medium mouse button , configure . try it simply . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re using a picture in the background of your desktop , this picture is set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this picture is displayed in the picture viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window is created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures in the image show . simply select the corresponding images from which you want to delete and press either the Rem@@ ov@@ ing button or select from the menu Edit . now , you will see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; photo album ; you can also use a solution for this problem . you can also use the pictures stored on your hard disk . of course , you have to record the pictures anywhere , so you can view the pictures from your hard disk . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; photo album ; if not all necessary images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; images , where the right corner is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for example the pictures 5 @-@ 9 are available , so you can view the pictures of these pictures . however , you can view the preview of these pictures . however , you can view these pictures with the picture viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see this function , you need to copy them out of the folders and copy them again . if you want to avoid trouble on the desired CD . so , if you want to avoid trouble on your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to store all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you can filter the pictures so that you may need to see them empty . alternatively , you can view all the pictures that can see your little sister , taxes and unlock the menu entry everything except current view . &quot;
&quot; thus , you have set what images should be hidden in case of the case . if you unlock the laptop with your little sister , simply dial the menu entry , allowing all the pictures you have locked out . if you want to display the pictures again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to establish a password , which must be entered for unlock the images . to establish this password , you simply select password change in the menu privacy . &quot;
&quot; please remember that this image protection is not very safe . for example , everyone can read or delete all the pictures on the hard drive and the other , everyone can read on the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . this kind of password protection serves only to den@@ ounce the password using &amp; c@@ photo@@ album ; not very familiar to forbid the view of private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want all your pictures featuring &amp; photo album ; manage and spend hours over hours so that you want to look at some point . from this reason , you can look at some point . from this reason , you can see them out of the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . it shows of course the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , such as who is done on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the Info@@ box is on the top part of the picture you want to see , you can also configure which information displayed and if any information is displayed . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . that &apos;s a released context menu , you can see below . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here the browser , see , matching entries to this show . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you were selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded several pictures in the viewer , you can easily change between them and back by using the keys picture high and end . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ s@@ 1 and end jump . these features are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if several pictures are loaded in the viewer , you can run these as Di@@ vor@@ au . then loads a new picture after a few seconds . as often as a new picture can be controlled by pressing the C@@ tr@@ l button and Plus or minus . by pressing the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S . &quot;
a very useful ability of the viewer &amp; photo album ; it is used in full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . just use the input button to switch back into full screen mode and back .
&quot; if you can use the viewer in the picture and zoom out in the picture . with the mouse button you can simply drag a rectangle with the mouse button . with the Min@@ us key , you can re @-@ zoom out the Plus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rectangle is marked and shows the result of the zo@@ idal . &quot;
&quot; with the point button you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . with the mouse button , the zo@@ oms , so that each pixel is equivalent to a pixels of the picture . &quot;
note that the only Zo@@ om@@ operations that work in videos that are in and zoom out with the plus and minus .
&quot; with the buttons from the context menu , you can rotate the picture . this doesn &apos;t work with videos . you can make comments on the actual picture with the menu option notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you can look at pictures , you can find a picture with a person whose name you &apos;ll have forgotten on the image . in the moment you can view the view and configuration dialog box of the image to mark these names . however , you will be able to mark the picture and look more pictures . &quot;
&quot; a further situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to view the pictures on paper . to see what pictures you can start viewing with the pictures , and to mark it as good or bad , while you are looking for one after another . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to view images using features , while you can view it . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature so that you are using the corresponding letter . in this way , you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set features on your pictures , these are available in your browser . so you can see all the images that you have to edit , print or whatever you have chosen . this is described in . afterwards , you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in the preview view . if you can view categories in DR@@ E Pre@@ views , then you can add the characteristics to the image by simply press the letters to the feature after the image was chosen . this can be seen here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you to paint &amp; photo album ; on the picture .
&quot; the common will not be saved with the image , but in the database . on the type you can do your painting later . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you can see a picture on the painted menu . to switch the painting of &amp; W photo album ; insert the image from the context menu . to finish the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar on the window . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sculp@@ er ; you need to control the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not complete , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you should definitely read and understood . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and the object in the wire model view is shown yellow . &quot;
you can also select several objects simultaneously . but not the object &apos;s object already selected as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object .
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position to insert the object , click on the icon in the tool@@ bar , or select a menu entry in the menu . &quot;
&quot; there are several possible locations , the following up @-@ up menu , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; with del@@ eting either from the menu bar , under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button you can remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed characteristics , click App@@ ly to adopt these changes . if you have in@@ correct values , a message is displayed with an error description . then you can click the Command Command button and reject the changes with shut@@ down . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the documentation in setting dialog , you can invo@@ ke the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 introduced the documentation . &quot;
&quot; when you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the self @-@ value view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the self @-@ value view and a small example of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . if you want to render an sub@@ ordin@@ ated texture , even if you want a sub@@ ordin@@ ated texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the whole texture map ) , you cross locally . &quot;
the screen photo shows the camera inspection points . you can pull these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the control points will disappear and it will display a small cross in the circuit diagram . this cross marks the centre for sc@@ aling and rotation as well . you can change the shift through pulling in the whole window . &quot;
each object has a visible level . you can specify this value relative to the Vis@@ i@@ bility level or as an absolute value . objects are only then displayed if they are selected or their visibility level lower or equal to the scene file chosen .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window order as default . the object @-@ tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the default window order , or if you need a different arrangement , you can set them as desired . you can also store multiple window orders and switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to lock a window over or under a present view , drag the picture to the upper or lower edge of a view . a rectangle then displays the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the picture to the right or left side of a view . the new view will then be an@@ cho@@ red on the right or left side of this view . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to arrange several views on each other , drag the facade in the middle of another view . you can then switch between the views on the map onto the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window association are floating views : views , which are not an@@ cho@@ red in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the cover to the desktop or click on the small to the left , pointing to the left . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the button bar . to prevent the closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views into the main window . in the menu View , you will find entries for any kind of views . new views are web @-@ woven , you can gr@@ ate them in any spot . &quot;
the current window view can store you with view window order ... save . it will display a dialog where you can store the window association under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ dering it . &amp; co@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ dering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual is written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 not supported . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ dering the current scene , click on the icon Ren@@ dering The Symbol Ren@@ ders in the tool bar , or select the menu entry to the scene . &quot;
&quot; a r@@ amp @-@ mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s In@@ i files . it controls the image size and quality of ren@@ dering . if you want to ren@@ dering a scene in different image sizes and quality stages , you can add a quick preview of up to full images in highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender ( in the tool bar ) or in the menu View R@@ ender Mo@@ di ... , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each upgrade mode has a name . you can enter any name , but it is a name that can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the cart@@ ing card size , you can enter the width and height of the rendered picture . if you want to ren@@ dering a small area of the picture , select the check box below and give the image section to ren@@ dering in the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in combination field , you can select the properties that uses &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; for ren@@ dering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user Reflex@@ ions lighting . an exhau@@ st@@ ive description of the r@@ amp properties can be found in the user manual &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; &quot;
&quot; if a picture is rendered with just a beam of pixels , there may be different mistakes . these pictures often have a mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or step effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details will not appear when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of this bug . in general photos can be seen better with this feature .
&quot; if you turn on an anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connect &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is a adap@@ tive non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is adap@@ tive because each pixel is always divided and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ ve depth depends on the calculated colour values .
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray include a beam of a pixel . if the difference between the values to the neighboring pixels , both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling . if you calculate the depth value of an additional number of pixels with extra points , a grid value of 5 then is 5x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
diff = abs ( r 1 @-@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 @-@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 @-@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference is exceeds the default threshold , the pixels is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixel size , which can be checked individually and further on further classification . maximum depth of records can be adjusted using the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process , called J@@ itter@@ ing . if you switch j@@ itter@@ ing , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the final setting for quality of ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light refle@@ x@@ ion . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this feature . &quot;
&quot; on this card , you can adjust to whether the alpha channels are calculated through POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object met . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly termin@@ ated , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene , select the menu entry file Imp@@ orting ... and select a file in the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; currently it supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; yet not the complete command @-@ catch of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; however , when import@@ ing error messages or war@@ nings , a dialogue window shows a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; import this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; to import the source code in the open text file in the Editor . to import objects into the scene , mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and insert into &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ et@@ er ; and in your editor you can add the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called if &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually it is PO@@ V@@ RAY or x @-@ PO@@ V@@ RAY .
&quot; when you click on the help in the stereotype view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sculp@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . set the path to your documentation and the version . support versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; search for external files ( for example altitude rock data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the scene of the scene , you also need to enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different ways of library , the first found file will be used . &quot;
the colour for wire models . the second color is used for displaying the selected objects .
the colour for the control points . the second color is used for viewing the selected inspection points .
the colour of the rectangle for the visual field in the camera view and in the window @-@ type label .
&quot; you can adjust the object to the points in the context menu of the screen menu button . you can set the buttons separately for shifts , sc@@ aling , and turns . &quot;
&quot; larger values produce an exact wire model and thus a better approach for the displayed objects , but require more time to ren@@ dering . for some objects such as the ball allows you to set the details stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High detail faithful for extended projec@@ tions , all wire @-@ scale views are further split , if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projec@@ tions are all projec@@ tions with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projec@@ tions . this property gives a better approach to projec@@ tions , but requires more time to ren@@ dering . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a wall , a wall behind the objects is sign@@ posted . the wall is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you cross the bottom , there is a bottom underneath the objects . the floor is displayed in a box pattern from two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you are able to enable ti@@ redness , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti@@ ali@@ asing method used for ren@@ dering the scenes . values for depth and swelling can be set . more precise information regarding the parameters you can find in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window arrangements or create new window orders . in the section window orders , you can create and store window orders . &quot;
the combination field standard window order : shows all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; uses the chosen window order at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of pre @-@ hand window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement allows you to add , and delete a selected arrangement with the button . &quot;
&quot; each window order is identified by the name . the name must be clearly , and must not be empty . &quot;
the list below the name shows all views for the chosen window order . new views can create and delete selected views with the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with New column you create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with cards , you can get a box view together with the previous view and unlock it in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have just &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and now and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; installed and now you want to follow any more specific knowledge of the two programs . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should make sure to use the ultimate but easy scene : a bul@@ let on a plane . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully notice the following war@@ nings , before you compl@@ ain about it as a result only a black screen . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider this important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for ren@@ dering may be applied as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t insert any light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you &apos;ll get only a black picture . &quot;
if you have installed everything faul@@ t@@ less then you can see at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; the following default window order :
&quot; take a little time to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool bar . please read the documentation , so you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you will often have to use these menus and symbols now , so you should remember the menus and symbols , and their application . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide you must first remove all objects from the object tree . mark the scene and then choose the menu entry . so you will now have a scene without objects .
&quot; the circuit diagram shows how the camera look at the whole scene , which you create . in particular , you will notice that in the fourth wire view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the scene of the camera . this shows you the result of the scene of the scene . &quot;
&quot; the object @-@ tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if they click on it , you can find the contents of the object properties , in which the various parameters of the camera can be found . in user documentation about &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; change nothing to the basic settings of the camera , this is later instructions reserved , but note that you can change the camera in view of control points , with which you can change the target point of the camera . just click on the left button and drag it to the desired spot . &quot;
&quot; if you push the button to push the button or the button button , change the wire view and the object @-@ tree immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the camera &apos;s view@@ point . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you might set a peg to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complete method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler way . you can use an infinite level as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button using or the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the circuit diagram also shows the level , even at the moment only as limited end@@ able level . if you ren@@ dering the scene , the plane extends up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking at the object tree , you &apos;ll notice that you can click on the icon + before the object . in this case you can only see the different parameters of the object . in this case , you can see the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , change the possible settings in the properties tab . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the bottom to the exercise a unit below the horizontal line , just so you can get some of these parameters . choose a shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first choose the floor to insert its material characteristics . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialogue where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the sign in the object tree . you can see the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview you see how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ments only shows a good black material because you need to add settings for the pig@@ ment . just remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on your pig@@ ment . also , there are many possibilities , but take the easiest way now . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the button in your preview , click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is right now . if you ren@@ dering your image now with a click on the icon , you should receive the following result : &quot;
of course you are not the colour that you have expected . here are further settings required . in the colour tree you need to enter two new attributes . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do so more frequently but the box colour list can only be used with two colors ) :
&quot; in the object tree , select every time and change the colors in view of the object properties : &quot;
this step should already be done simply because you should already be able to create the basic operation of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; they have already understood . the ball lets you create as easy as the ground :
&quot; in view of object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input or the button to press ) so that the ball has shi@@ fted over the ground , as you have moved the ground around a unit to the bottom . &quot;
&quot; of course , ren@@ dering is now a strange result : as already before , the ball @-@ surface seems like a m@@ ole black material . put in the following step is a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the ball , you can as@@ sign your material now . as already in the floor , give the ball a pig@@ ment as color : &quot;
&quot; first select sub@@ object , and change the name for example in ball pig@@ ment . Click on ball pig@@ ment , then select one hand and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach more interesting effects , if you take time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
&quot; then change the values as in the following screen pictures , and click on users or press the input button . &quot;
&quot; the setting radi@@ ance effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chromium @-@ plated surfaces , even if metallic : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of it , which possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ sculp@@ er ; offers . hopefully you have learned as much as you can create simple , but nice scenes . &quot;
ra@@ y@@ tra@@ y@@ tra@@ cing is a special method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you are using a scene ra@@ y@@ tra@@ ys , ren@@ dering the ren@@ derer &apos;s hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays ) from the perspective of the viewer ( i.e. from the camera that reflects the scenes ) through every pixel &apos;s visual effects , the visual effects of light sources in the scene and how atmospheric effects can be processed . so the scene is processed for pixel . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you will see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye , with which you see the scene . without a light source , you can see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously every scene need to be made , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . PO@@ V@@ RAY files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in the standard file dialog you can select a file , which you have before with &amp; c@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; created &quot;
&quot; whenever you can open a new model or create , the file will be inserted into this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . it is a new file , you &apos;ll need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
imagine the scene in the last stored version . all changes have been dis@@ car@@ ded since the last store .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not stored yet stored changes in the scene .
repe@@ ats the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu entry only if you are using editing .
&quot; saves the current window order , and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement , or write an existing arrangement . &quot;
&quot; in this menu , you &apos;ll find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ ers ; here you can change the appearance , the key pendant and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog for the modification of the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add this option , for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ et@@ er ; commands or add new commands . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog for setting the tool@@ bars . you can add and remove the tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ et@@ er ; commands , and remove commands . &quot;
&quot; a B@@ ump @-@ Map is one way to create rough surfaces , without changing any buttons on the surface , and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is usual to use the same file as well as for a B@@ ump @-@ Map as well as for a texture map .
&quot; basic bodies are simple geomet@@ ric shapes , which you can use as a building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these deposits . these models will then be processed to give them a realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis by using a picture file as color chart .
&amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a comfortable picture viewer and browser . the application has a file browser where you can choose pictures to display .
pictures can be displayed in your own window in the size of the picture or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can display using the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or key return .
&quot; you can set whether any image will appear in your own window , or if all images are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame is found , the file will be highlighted by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in dialogue setting - &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; there are five flash@@ cards . in three of them , General , editing and slide show ; set in the two others , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the key figures for the respective windows may be specified . &quot;
&quot; this is selected , then the images are opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background colour , which you can keep further below . default is no full screen . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you can see the actual picture . this reduces the delay , if you choose the next image , and is especially suitable for sli@@ deshow . &quot;
with this option stores &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; at the end of the last opened folder . the next start is opened &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; Click on the colored beams to select a background colour . this is used to fill the background screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , it will also be filled with the selected color here . &quot;
&quot; you can get &amp; add @-@ show ; so , set up that only some of the file types are displayed , which can also display the program too . &quot;
&quot; with this option , the display window is enlarged for large images on the full screen . this option is enabled as default . &quot;
determines whether the sli@@ deshow starts with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; the time span between the image changes in a slide show . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or use the small arrows to the right next to the command field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; the number of repe@@ ats . if this value is set to 0 , sli@@ deshow will be repeated until they are broken down by the user . in order to change the value , you can use a new value into the input field or the small arrows to the right next to the command field . the default is 1 . &quot;
&quot; change the key figures for the different operating modes of &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short , for the display window and short commands for the browser . &quot;
&quot; using this option , switch between the two articles of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays huge symbols for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in the short presentation .
shows small symbols for files in the folder . this ad is possible only in the short presentation .
shows Pre@@ views for the files in the folder . this ad is possible only in the short presentation .
shr@@ inks the picture by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the picture .
increased by 10 % . the factor refers to the actual size of the picture .
closes the display window for pictures . &amp; c@@ ick@@ show ; will also be closed if no browser window is open .
view the image in original size . this is only useful if automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; opens the input field for completion . enter the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame , which you seek . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show photo ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; photo editing based on &amp; di@@ gi@@ ate ; image processing . &amp; show photo ; is part of the &amp; di@@ gi@@ l ; project .
&amp; show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to watch and perform correc@@ tions and correc@@ tions .
&quot; as the rest of &amp; K@@ DE ; is &amp; show photo ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to contribute its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show photo ; makes it easy to report any mistakes or possible improvements to you . wherever you are in the program , your browser contains a link to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already completed , and you can simply follow the instructions for giving your message . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means users and developers can help each other . if you are a more common user from &amp; show photo ; however , we would like to answer any other users of &amp; show photo ; however , you can soon be able to answer questions other users . in this mailing list , you should therefore be powerful this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to get on &amp; show photo ; to participate , it is to join the developer list . guide to the developer &apos;s mailing list of &amp; show photo ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; show photo ; try to give you much control of its work processes as possible . there are many options to set up the behaviour of &amp; show photo ; to set up on these settings , you need to set up in eight pages . you can change between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed if the under@@ - or over@@ load resist@@ ator should be selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display colours with what you should display , in contrast . under@@ bel@@ i@@ ation should display a dark color and over@@ exposed a dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ piece photo ; also features an aspect bar on the right edge which provides you important information and promotions to the selected pictures . you can view this view in which you click on one of the five riders :
&quot; &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images , which do not make more than pictures to scan and add . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Asc@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and add images , which do not power more than pictures and save the pictures immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . users can view the pictures prior to retri@@ eve . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner on the s@@ ane project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ s@@ ane @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .p@@ l .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line of &amp; channel , with the command line @-@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner can not be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selection of the scanner is opened . &quot;
users can select the scanner and press OK to open the scanner . cancel the scanner and termin@@ ate the scanner .
the further settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; each person ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not respond to these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a pr@@ one and then start scanning for the final scan . the for@@ mid@@ able can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can zoom in the picture and zoom out of the current selection out . it can also adjust the zoom that the complete preview into the window . &quot;
&quot; when the picture was selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if before saving a preview of view in the settings , then the image will be displayed in a window frame , as it is pressed , then the image is stored and lie ? en leads to a demol@@ ition and you get back into the main window . &quot;
through the button settings the ep@@ onymous dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the main settings here .
&quot; users can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case , the option has to be selected before saving a preview of users . if this preview of users are not desired , the option must be chosen . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them the way to choose . dialog to store for each image , opens the dialog before each single sc@@ anned image . if &amp; you can open the dialog before each single specified file , you &apos;ll need to save them without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save without a file name . if the pictures are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as standard for the dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the automatically save images and is beyond the proposed name for the image in dialog for saving . the automatically stored image gets a numer@@ ical view@@ er@@ ix of each time , when a picture is stored . the string bag # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; users can adjust the image quality to save image quality . this value also changes the compression value for saving . if select the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Help launches the K@@ DE help with the &amp; channel ; -@@ manual . the button over starts the K@@ DE about -@@ Dialog for &amp; channel ; the kno@@ b settings show the dialog for settings and settings can be used to end &amp; run .
&quot; when the GP@@ L is licensed under the GP@@ L , the lib@@ ks@@ ane library is used under the GP@@ L . attention : li@@ bs@@ ane is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; used as all other programs ke@@ yst@@ ick . you can set up a list of these cuts and their function . you can set up a list of these cuts in the Player Window . select the &amp; Cat@@ amar@@ ok ; click on the Player Window to click on the Player window and set a short command .
you may also set up existing multimedia buttons so that they are working as &amp; amar@@ ok ; quick command work . thus make your keyboard to the &amp; amar@@ ok ; -@@ control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ interface from Amar@@ ok has a lot of general functions that are mostly found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ COP functions of collection , context @-@ brows@@ ers , player , play@@ list , play@@ list Browser and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports the command @-@ stretching options of Q@@ t and K@@ DE ; in addition , Amar@@ ok also has some own command @-@ scenes options . &quot;
&quot; you should return to the user if the script cannot be executed because of a missing depen@@ dency . please check in your script , whether all required modules are available and use box , so that the user cannot run why a script doesn &apos;t run . &quot;
bur@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from c@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is Re@@ quired for this script . &apos; che@@ qu@@ ad --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit end
&quot; in many different languages , you can find a lot of template script files in many different languages . you can quickly find them as the basis for your own scripts or simply write them around the required functions . you will quickly find that the scripts are relatively simple . &quot;
&quot; using D@@ COP , your scripts can exchange data using Amar@@ ok and Amar@@ ok . the sim@@ pl@@ est way is the use of the command d@@ co@@ p , which should be included in each K@@ DE installation . &quot;
&quot; most scri@@ p@@ ting languages facilitate the result of external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; is usually called to be called d@@ co@@ p &gt; relatively easily . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all current scripts . for this reason , scripts must continuously monitor their default settings and react to events . of course , a script should also ignore the events if it does not use it . &quot;
&quot; configure . is the script to indicate the setting dialog . to store the store data each script needs to worry . if a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the working folder to the folder , where all data should be saved . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ change signals that a new piece is all@@ u@@ ded . the script will now be &amp; z@@ b ; with D@@ COP functions further information on the new piece ( for example the met@@ ad@@ ata or the play length ) .
&quot; volume Change new@@ ness signals a change of volume . the new volume is an integer , between 0 and 100 . &quot;
custom@@ izing the path to the selected files of the play@@ list if a user @-@ defined menu entry can be identified . in order to add a post @-@ defined menu entry , you can use the D@@ COP @-@ function d@@ co@@ p amar@@ ok script exec@@ ve@@ able Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; ends , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; the signal SIG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed to do so . for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ a script administration can also install script packages , which can be downloaded from a web@@ server ; such packages are basically normal T@@ ar @-@ archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can also be identified using b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) which can also recognize the archive unique as Amar@@ ok script package . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the extension amar@@ ca script . for this reason you should ren@@ ame your script packages right correctly .
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar @-@ parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can download it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and hang on the link to the Wik@@ i Script side by &amp; amar@@ ok ; you should use the Cat@@ amar@@ ok category ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; K@@ DE ; . &amp; amar@@ ok ; has many beneficial and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; amar@@ ok , you can simply drag the music to the play@@ list instead of endless menus . you may also look for a very specific title of thousands in your collection . with &amp; amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Colle@@ ctors @-@ Browser and Quick Find will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the play@@ lists browser is exactly the right thing for you . and if you &apos;re still difficult to choose , select the dynamic mode and intelligent play@@ lists automatically select the correct music after certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has an excellent support for Apple iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . also , how you can choose to listen to your music . this and many other useful features make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to re @-@ experience your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you need to enter the following in the basic folder of Amar@@ ok sources to comp@@ ile and install Amar@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should have no difficulty in comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; K@@ DE ; mailing lists . &quot;
&amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; as most of the applications enable some options to enable or dis@@ able the compilation of the configure script . this is a list of available options .
some of the comp@@ iling options must be certain depen@@ dencies have to be met so that they can be used . details can be found in section system requirements .
&quot; activ@@ ates icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you would like to help you in the development of &amp; amar@@ ok , you should be full . &quot;
&amp; amar@@ ok ; can be set without any trouble on setting dialog . the setting dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the various functions of &amp; amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; additionally , the player window switches off the play@@ list in addition to play@@ list . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists window t@@ t@@ ju@@ k is displayed . &quot;
&quot; tuning barometer : this function is only available , if &amp; amar@@ ok is compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option switches the experimental function of the voting bar@@ ometer . &quot;
&quot; design : this feature is only available , if &amp; amar@@ ok was compiled ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this means the used colour scheme for the mood changes is modified . &quot;
tuning files from the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; amar@@ ok is compiled . if this setting is activated , .@@ mood files are stored on the storage place of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder from &amp; amar@@ ok ; saved ( usually ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : allows you to choose which browser of &amp; amar@@ ok will be started if a browser is required .
use other brows@@ ers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; play@@ list when you save , stores the current play@@ list automatically at the end of &amp; amar@@ ok ; . turn this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : if you activate this setting , &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the storage location of the play@@ list , otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; current piece at the unit changes are visible , that the play@@ lists window opens / off , to keep the running window always at the visible window range . &quot;
&quot; when changing to the context @-@ Browser editing , automatically changes the context @-@ browser when the next piece is all@@ u@@ ded . &quot;
in the section image you can custom@@ ize &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; the section is implemented in three parts .
&quot; in the font section , you can use the use of various fon@@ ts in &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok . you can select scripts in the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context @-@ brows@@ ers . press on select ... , so you can select a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of user @-@ defined colour scheme , you can define the choice of choice and can design@@ ate their own color scheme . in addition , use the selected color selection for front and background colour . &quot;
&quot; starting at the start , that &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok starts automatically ; after the program start@@ up , playback will be automatically re@@ loc@@ alised with which it was stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; set the bottom of on @-@ screen display , allowing you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is customized , a preview of the O@@ SD is displayed and you can look at the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . Click on select ... to select from the dialog to select the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow ensures that the text is displayed in the O@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; own colors are available to you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for let@@ tering and background . a click on the color space opens the dialog for color selection . when Eig@@ ene is not enabled , the pre @-@ set &amp; K@@ DE ; colors are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text display displays the text in the O@@ SD . through the input of plac@@ eholders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to its own needs . below , you will find a list of available plac@@ eholder and what they mean . &quot;
the screen is designed for X@@ iner@@ ama @-@ users . you can define what screen is to appear on a multi @-@ monitor environment that is to appear on the O@@ SD .
the card @-@ card audio @-@ edition allows you to select an audio driver from the select box . some drivers still activate more adjust@@ ing options in this card card .
the card collection will be used to set up all settings for your collection . that includes the folder and type of the database for collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . in order to include a folder into the collection with its name . this section also contains approaches to set the check box , as with the selected folders . &quot;
sub@@ folder re@@ ital@@ ic : this causes an amar@@ ok ; as well as their sub@@ folder as well as their sub@@ folder as well as well .
&quot; monitor changes : allows &amp; amar@@ ok ; , select the selected folder to change ( e.g. music files are added or deleted ) . additionally , an incre@@ mental search is carried out to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
&quot; import play@@ lists : causes , &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists into your collections folder ( .@@ pl@@ - and .m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection , which automatically added to play@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; the part of Colle@@ ctors @-@ database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field drivers : lets you select between SQ@@ Lite or MySQL . if MySQL is selected , another setup is necessary in the MySQL server . &quot;
&quot; the MySQL server section is used to set the database for &amp; amar@@ ok ; using calcul@@ ator : if the computer is set , where the MySQL database is accessible , under which the database is achie@@ vable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use U@@ ser@@ name : and password : to insert the data that are needed for connection to the database .
the card pay@@ .@@ f@@ m as@@ sures the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of each pieces to a heavy .@@ f@@ m server and to create music recommendations concerning the current quantities .
&quot; here you enter your us@@ ername and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you don &apos;t have a profile , you can record one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
&quot; send parts , send the profile and update the profile : this setting makes it &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; , the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar Interpre@@ ting @-@ calls : after activ@@ ating this setting is &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; a list of similar interpre@@ ters to each played each . you can see the list in context @-@ brows@@ ers . note : you need not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . further information can be found in summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photographs .
&quot; am@@ aro@@ K needs only the package of K@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you have to have K@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the included programs , because &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to be compiled for example modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD is predic@@ t that your window managers are keeping the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ kt@@ op@@ .org , for example , Flu@@ x@@ box will work for example . we are trying to support am@@ aro@@ K on all platforms , therefore we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide excellent development environment . &quot;
&quot; probably one of your files will probably bring an error in the Tag@@ li@@ b library in days . you can see this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org , and you can also attach the en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated file that caused the crash . afterwards , you can delete the file and recre@@ ate the collection again . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , it is estimated that Tag@@ li@@ b when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file system . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developers under bug@@ s.@@ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; amar@@ ok ; is somewhat mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure that all of &amp; amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . for example , &amp; amar@@ ok ; with GCC 3.4 , day Li@@ b but with GCC 3.@@ 3.x , then it leads to crash when working met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE to use art@@ s@@ d , turn off machine . switch off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically open to a crash ) , and when it comes to a good back@@ trace , the bug is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data are writing as UTF @-@ 8 in the met@@ a @-@ info , but it does not describe as Unicode . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / us@@ r / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; doesn &apos;t exist &quot; &quot; f $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; _ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3- &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ CP@@ AN -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : Mp@@ li@@ b &apos;
&amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; s symbols on the status bar ( random mode ) / repet@@ ition / dynam@@ ical play@@ list . this is a well @-@ known error in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes you can click the status tab to grey and semi @-@ transparent . note that in some cases up to three times you can click on a icon until this setting shows its effect .
&quot; if you get this error : amar@@ ok@@ app : symbol look@@ up error : unknown symbol : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ Systems Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel , then please check if am@@ aro@@ K uses the correct Q@@ t library . this allows you to see the ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ co@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t . &quot;
&quot; to fix this error , you possibly need to remove any col@@ li@@ ant Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust the correct version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most of the installation problems are sure to clarify your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also use help with other users or for the developers . use the Forum and the IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # amar@@ ok .
bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please only wear a bug in case of an error in am@@ aro@@ K itself .
after the start of &amp; amar@@ ok ; appears only an empty play@@ list . how come there music pieces there ?
&quot; this is simple . use the file browser on the left , and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface intu@@ iti@@ vely , the start window is converted into the statistic window . you will find it under ex@@ tras . &quot;
the importance of these symbols have changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are automatically calculated for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the valuation list must be displayed in the play@@ list . Click on the Tit@@ les of the play@@ list , and select column display . you can also use the short @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works if Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press off on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then choose from play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; drag a play@@ list file to the play@@ list and let them go there , just as you would also do with other files . that &apos;s how easy it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the play@@ list , right next to the button button , you &apos;ll save the button list . Click on . &quot;
&quot; presumably the program X@@ M@@ MS @-@ config . install the X@@ M@@ MS @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ al , this package contains many very nice visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) , and you will find it on the menu bar under ex@@ tras Equali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , therefore the real question must be supported by G@@ stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ mm / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we can even support text and P@@ NG code ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which no MP3 decoder will be supplied . the solution : Alt @-@ F2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 K@@ DE , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa @-@ S@@ ink , the device needs to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and run simultaneously audio mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa ( for example S@@ B@@ live ) . take a look at the D@@ mix for AL@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you in search of the problem and cause a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you possibly need to specify a different sink ( e.g. oss@@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; this does &amp; amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be de@@ coded . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ coded them and sends the PCM data to AL@@ SA . exactly like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can spend directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; either use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . enable sound server with highest possible priority ( real @-@ time pri@@ or@@ ity ) , and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure that art@@ sw@@ ra@@ pper su@@ id is set : &quot;
&quot; with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ Multimedia code@@ cs , which can cause hard playing . read this error report . the enlarge of the Sound @-@ buffer in your AL@@ SA configuration file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help . &quot;
&quot; either do you use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia complete to get the faster Arts code@@ cs ( li@@ fel@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; presumably you use the Arts driver . use a different driver ( the x@@ ine driver was highly optimized ) , or reduce the size of the Arts buffer in the control centre and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less applications react to the visu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok . from . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . perform G@@ ST regi@@ sters to register all of the G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help you can also ask in the IR@@ C @-@ channel #
&quot; try this ( quit am@@ aro@@ v before ! ) : - Store you down , comp@@ ile and install it . if you then delete G@@ ST regi@@ sters , once again as a system administrator and once as your normal user . delete the module file with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer config ) and execute G@@ ST regi@@ sters again . start now &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok . &quot;

this command makes &amp; amar@@ ok ; the playback start . make sure that &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed then you will have stopped by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before bed@@ time .
how to get the current in &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; running the current title when you &apos;re on another computer ?
&quot; if a functional SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . command instruction gives you interpre@@ t and title of the running piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA , re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user hi@@ re@@ usable amar@@ ok player railway Pl@@ aying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your us@@ ername with your us@@ ername . this assumes that your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ RSA is present .

&quot; this is basically the previous evaluation with a decl@@ ining value , based on how often the piece was played . the more often the piece has been played , the less influence has each individual review on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can click the evaluation for a piece by clicking on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . here you can review rating . then you can click the review of a piece in the play@@ list , and edit : review or F2 . you can also edit the evaluation in dialog met@@ ad@@ ata . &quot;

&quot; presumably , &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok was compiled ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or g@@ stre@@ amer . therefore , the output module does not have compiled &amp; cat@@ amar@@ ok ; you need to configure and install . &quot;
&quot; now I have &amp; amar@@ ok ; new installed , but the output modules are not yet available yet . and now ? &quot;
&quot; presumably you use a distribution that is installed from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you have to re@@ comp@@ ile and install x@@ ine ; again re@@ comp@@ ile and install . &quot;
I get the error G@@ stre@@ amer @-@ Crit@@ ical * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos; has no type .. How can I fix this ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with Pre@@ lin@@ king , this is in@@ compatible with G@@ stre@@ amer . you need to comp@@ ile G@@ stre@@ amer without pre@@ lin@@ king . a tip of Merlin @-@ t@@ c : uses no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you comp@@ ile am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
&quot; I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype au@@ dia / mp@@ 4 , although the g@@ asp@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed . &quot;
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , must also be installed by g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the mistake There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module @-@ stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then execute as a system administrator G@@ ST @-@ register . then you will start am@@ aro@@ K . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can am@@ aro@@ K use the second sound@@ card ?
&quot; setting up am@@ aro@@ K settings ... audio @-@ output enter the device . typical , for example H@@ W : 0 for the standard sound card and H@@ W : 1 for the second sound card . &quot;
here you can see an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine using a P@@ AC@@ 97 code@@ c and a USB audio device :
pc@@ s. smart@@ 8x@@ 0 { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 0 &quot; } ct@@ l @-@ audio { type plug sl@@ av@@ e.@@ p@@ cm &quot; H@@ W : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l.@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type H@@ W card 1 }
&quot; enter the connection dialog by x@@ ine now us@@ b @-@ audio , and the output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of the conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , turn off the skins on sound@@ card m@@ map . &quot;

&quot; closes the current project . if a project has changed and not stored yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what should happen . you can then break between stores and changes . moreover , you may also break off and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project &apos;s stored project , which should be done as if you had called for each project file . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects and termin@@ ated &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for each project is asked , what should be done so as if you had called file sh@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select about the released dialog files to add to the project . that &apos;s the same effect when you enter the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files are in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog &quot; Burn &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the media . burning dialogue may only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here you can set many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different potential settings , most of which are described above the What is this ? help ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it &apos;s useful if you use files for a multi @-@ session CD . this is useful if you can &apos;t use files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s more useful for you to see the media already existing files and folders .
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this feature set &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; imported files from the current project . all other files remain in the project . this feature is not removed from the media , it bl@@ ends only the previously imported files . &quot;
&quot; opens the CD copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a CD on a different medium . alternatively , you can only use a copy of a CD which you can then burn down later . you should also add cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; opens the DVD copy dialog . this allows you to create copying a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can also save a copy of a DVD to another medium . also , there is also the possibility of creating a DVD with the help of copying files . moreover , the target medium must be big enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form . &quot;
&quot; to delete a CD @-@ RW series , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW drive . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to form@@ att@@ ing a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) format , making the content completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes and incre@@ ment@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; burning an earlier CD image . the dialog asks you to be burned down after a * .@@ is@@ o , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source , which is then not supported immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not supported yet , you need other tools like N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burning an earlier DVD copy . the dialog asks you to a * .@@ is@@ o file as a source of data , which can be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously announced DVD video can be converted . this dialogue window usually appears according to the reading of a DVD in the content view , but can also be used too standing . it contains information about the read video , coding Settings and even possibilities for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the set media . this information is presented in the content view and include properties of the media , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if an entry is crossed , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
if this is crossed is a small strip at the lower edge of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not crossed is the status bar ends .
&quot; switches off the folder view or off . the folder view includes a review of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their contents will be displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives have also displayed a context menu with functions such as media info , locks , and unlock the disc or dis@@ card of the media . &quot;
&quot; the content view is switched on or off . the content view allows the selecting and drag of files into the project view . the content view is also the interface to read audio or video CDs , if a drive was selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ land in the project view is a narrow area , which is only visible if the project view is visible . the head@@ land has no real function , it looks only pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window for changing the Tast@@ ing arrangements for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after one of the available commands are chosen in the upper part , you can adjust the key figures for this further below . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; alignment assist@@ ants , so you can set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , system administrator rights are required , so you need to enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) . &quot;
&quot; open up the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here , general programming settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should function at An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is intended for person@@ alising and the host@@ ility of the program . &quot;
&quot; as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications also , as many other &amp; K@@ DE ; applications are also equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; D@@ COP ; functions to use , you can either use the command program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are crucial in the functional scope , therefore , is rather your taste and the type of your task is crucial , which the bit@@ ration programs will give you prec@@ urs@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line d@@ co@@ p . to make use of the &amp; D@@ COP ; functions must make sure you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ COP ; functions , which have all &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Programme in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts which are described below . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b features ; features such as copy@@ cd , formal DVD and other features to create new projects . &quot;

&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ project method , one can produce a D@@ COP reference to the newly created project : D@@ COP@@ ref ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can receive a project about the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b interface curr@@ ent@@ Project with using this reference is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Projec@@ t@@ Interface which can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; fol@@ klore Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) , cre@@ ate@@ ful ( Q@@ string name , Q@@ string ) , and add@@ ur@@ ls ( K@@ URL : : List UR@@ Ls , Q@@ string values ) , and Q@@ string path ( Q@@ string path , Q@@ String new@@ name ) , output volume ( Q@@ string path ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files into the new folder : &quot;

&quot; audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is an audio CD ; -@@ reading for &amp; K@@ DE ; with it can be easily read audio CD ; s read and installed in MP@@ 3- or OGG files . also other formats are possible , depending on encoder of computers installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; is the user interface of cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on the hard disk ) and from many enco@@ ders , which can be added to these WAV files ( compressed @-@ free compression ) and many enco@@ ders can still be added to the program ( if installed ) . &quot;
&quot; first , the titles of &amp; CD ; read and stored in WAV files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) will be compressed into the MP@@ 3- or OGG format or even in other formats such as loss @-@ free F@@ LA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; it is used by &amp; calibr@@ ate ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not installed yet , this has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , lame ( for MP3 ) , og@@ g@@ before ( for OGG ) or other enco@@ ders are already present , so it is very likely not necessary to comp@@ ile it . but if F@@ LA@@ C will not be used , the installation is also not necessary . &quot;
which coefficient / file format should be used ? the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer gives a small introduction over Ko@@ di@@ erer , audio quality and compres@@ sing factors . &quot;
&quot; a word for copying of protected audio CD ; s : as already mentioned , use &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is not possible to read any copy protection . if not the Firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device is not possible to avoid any copy protection . if not , avoid the mechanism of copy protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only one thing must be done ( the setting dialog can be found so often called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily use of a &amp; CD ; which leads to a hard drive . this leads to the slim approach of the user interface , which you often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which programs are installed ( MP3 , OGG , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc . ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b from the internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
&quot; this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the side step , for example , further information , such as this program is used as well as screen pictures with descriptions of the program maps for the configuration of the program . &quot;
&quot; starts the CD@@ DB request of CD data according to the setup of CD@@ DB . ( this may be locally or online , in the latter case must first be established the connection to the Internet . ) &quot;
starts the reading and - if a Encoder has been configured in the registry entry system - encoding settings .
opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available encoder so that the selection with other encoder can be read as the default . it is to be aware that previously the encoder in the tab card settings was configured in setting dialog dialog .
&quot; opens the file manager , so that a already selected file will be selected instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and coding . &quot;
opens the setting dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , p@@ ie@@ p@@ sen ) for program events ( such as read the &amp; CD ; finished ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main office dialog by &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; with different flash@@ cards ( such as Encoder , for setting up the En@@ code ) . here you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ als and compression rates and helps you with the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is required , a loss @-@ free audio format is required . besides F@@ LA@@ C there are also other similar to &apos; sh@@ orts &apos; or &apos; Monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the dis@@ advantages are low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can play these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression , MP3 and OGG are the most common . OGG likes today a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above that bit rate the differences are less important because both co@@ als are very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so free , but it &apos;s still supplied with most distri@@ butions for free but there are open license questions &quot;
&quot; + high up to very high quality of sound ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with OGG easily lower quality at lower bit@@ rate . &quot;
OGG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a computer @-@ based music system and / or if one of the few existing OGG cutting devices is present .
&quot; MP3 - If music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special Auto @-@ Adapter . today - beginning 2009 - support these devices mostly only the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; lame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; lame --@@ help &apos; for additional parameters ) :
&apos; --@@ pre@@ set medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency to most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most music pieces of acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for stereo @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of titles . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for stereo @-@ stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR joint stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of each tit@@ els . good pleasure for music of young people , portable devices and auto@@ ster@@ e@@ o@@ facilities . but not good enough for better stereo audio systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set Ins@@ ane &apos; = 320@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then select this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that be entered manually or by the program automatically removed from Free@@ D@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can surrender / used to create file names and file names , as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with body programs , there are often a combination of programming settings for the Ko@@ di@@ erer and these parameters here . the manual or help to the Ko@@ di@@ ers declare the switch for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the &amp; CD ; to add the title to the keyword ( English : day ) if MP@@ 3@@ s must be encoded with lame , the switch -@@ tt of lame and the title parameters must be added ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ tt { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ .de ; parameters which can be used ( = rat@@ chet name in the assistant ) :
&quot; this is what the Free@@ D@@ b is : a free database to enter the audio CDs , so that all other information can be downloaded from the machine , so that all other information can be downloaded from the machine : &amp; CD ; titles , artists , names of pieces , etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal but I am not a lawyer , but I am not an attor@@ ney . however , nobody can stop that from the &amp; CD ; more or less valuable , so neither the artist nor the music companies can be added . all information can be added anyway with a bum@@ ble through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtu@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; col@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; it is active to choose a check box . in this type of configuration , it may not be used with another ( counter@@ feit ) address . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address will not be used by the server ( This may only know the programmer to check the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; for use of Free@@ D@@ b , the closest mirror server will be needed . this saves bandwidth on the network and resem@@ bles the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org provides a current list of Spiegel@@ servers for online depar@@ tures of &amp; CD ; information on reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the actu@@ ali@@ z@@ ations of the database .
which program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; save in WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there is rum@@ ors that cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; if you want to know it , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading the audio CD ; . to note that the cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package has to be installed first if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the selected WAV files , the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be selected and therefore select the desired file format . at first open , pre@@ defined entries for lame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and F@@ LA@@ C ( a loss @-@ free compression of audio data ) can be added to the tab . other co@@ als can be added on this tab . &quot;
&quot; the Ko@@ di@@ erer package needs to be installed from the relevant Linux distribution , before the Ko@@ di@@ erer can be used . this is also necessary for the pre @-@ defined co@@ di@@ erer . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer can be found in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; after installing a Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers , further information on its switches can be obtained through the input of a command such as lame -@@ help or lame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . this must be replaced by the name of the installed Ko@@ di@@ er@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this may have many causes . check the device of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write @-@ and readers of your choice ( lame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , F@@ LA@@ C &amp; etc . ) . try to put both programs with a command line in one terminal . that might be a hint of what is wrong . &quot;
check whether you don &apos;t want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check out the shell of the &amp; CD ; it will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step for example . even if you use other settings , can give this tips how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the full manual , everything is understood , but somehow you still have to do something ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time to setup everything and use our first &amp; CD ; we will be lame &apos; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 sample ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; it must be cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and lame already installed on your computer . both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution , as it will be found as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to comp@@ ile the source files , whatever you can do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / us@@ r / share / cd consists and that you own write permission ( eg ; by trying to copy the quer@@ or something into it ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; , something which probably will be done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the approach to read a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each issued &amp; CD ; &quot;
here we determine the use of the recording of music ( lame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pre@@ set extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are la@@ zy to share the program with which Free@@ D@@ b can be used to download the &amp; CD ; data from the Internet .
&quot; though we can change these settings at any time , we are probably not likely to be found in any evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device command is handed over to the reader program that it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces may be read .
&quot; often , / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device type of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is also available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device design@@ ations for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card general settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here , an additional conversion is defined . in our example , everything will be om@@ itted / entered as shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; only If you select any further information , so that you will be informed if you are informed about the evidence of the keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
the card settings CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are convenient and leave the &amp; CD ; data automatically via the Internet from a Free@@ D@@ b computer .
note : the calcul@@ ator must be connected during the reading of the &amp; CD ; it will be connected to the Internet to access the Free@@ D@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are un@@ happy with the database entry and the register names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag names , you can easily change . the directory and file name can be easily changed using the database file and the ID3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; K@@ DE ; Tag@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to enter everything manually , select the select fields and Free@@ D@@ b is not used . however , this over 620 MB will be superior to you . however , this is more than 620 MB . however , these two selection areas must be selected , at least the first . the mode will be set up on the following card . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB is for us Free@@ D@@ b . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from Free@@ D@@ b server via the Internet . how does the system know which data will be released ? read the section about Free@@ D@@ b . place everything as shown in the screenshot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we have not downloaded the database , we want to work only with remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; CD@@ DB @-@ Server : please go to page fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and look after a mirror server in your area . on this way , the load is distributed between the machines . however , this setting will function as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both of them work as equivalent to the server , because many fire@@ walls run the protocol 88@@ 80 standard , maybe more happiness with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf in the internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we don &apos;t want to transmit any &amp; CD ; data to Free@@ D@@ b server . the first check box should be enough . &quot;
simply take the settings from the screenshot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is existing on your computer )
&quot; number of applied pieces : exc@@ use , there is a reason why more than one at the same time at only an existing drive ? simultaneous reading and code ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , therefore just try . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last play , check this to the &amp; CD ; throw at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; user @-@ defined file for temporary files : if you &apos;re crossed this , then the path / folders can be specified if only space on another drive is provided . if this file is not checked , the files will not be checked in a private folder . don &apos;t forget that folder when you want to do something with the WAV files . &quot;
&quot; everything just enter as it is on the screen photo . the command is somewhat long , under the circumstances something has to be til@@ ted to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pre@@ set extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , it is sufficient for very good audio quality , even for very good stereo audio systems . the resulting rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the record &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of tags to Version V1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 . tags can be deleted . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag@@ ger for &amp; K@@ DE ; in case of a later change of tags ( including the complete path ) and output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest like in the screenshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneous WAV files : in a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine , more than a WAV file can be encoded simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we have just finished the basic setup of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ .de ; this configuration is used as standard for each evaluation of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organis@@ ational structure of your music , you will never need to change them again . &quot;
&quot; in this section , it is described as the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will pick up MP3 files , as we are comfortable and the &amp; CD ; data from Free@@ D@@ b will be able to pick up the process that is described in this section , needs to be repeated for each copy &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we are using a &amp; CD ; the screen pictures are not included in Free@@ D@@ b , you will see the screen pictures with a bit different from Free@@ D@@ b . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; they will select data manually instead of taking them out of the internet . comments are drawn to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it is a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , now the &amp; CD ; into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and length should be listed in the window , as in screenshot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and read by cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this is not done , search in section questions and answers according to the help or go back to the previous section regarding basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD ; successfully picked up from Free@@ D@@ b , all the tracks are filled out and the name of the artist and the album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a window appears , and you can select the database entry , in your opinion , best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you do not select the check box for the automatic pick @-@ off of Free@@ D@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have local database , you will need the connection to the internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entry of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
specify the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Update &apos; entitled &apos; the rest of the data in the &apos; Album &apos; Album &apos; .
&quot; the artist must not be entered into the &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ eller title &apos; input field , unless you have a compilation with different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower commentary field may be used for the individual comments on ini@@ quities per piece , the comment @-@ field of the album is used for comments which will apply to all the pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful conclusion of the data from Free@@ D@@ b the CD file is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following screen image . however , it is always a good idea to verify the contents of the CD Edit@@ ors ( e.g. if all words are starting with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to verify if there are any undes@@ ired notes . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this restri@@ cts the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece and only 28 characters for the comment area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field length , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; maximum option . this option will be installed on the tab &quot; tab settings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; tags are not supported by all Ko@@ di@@ ers , respectively file formats . see in the help to the Ko@@ di@@ erer , in order to obtain more information . &quot;
&quot; simply select one entry , which is obviously compatible with the style of the selected CD ; this example is not important because we don &apos;t transmit the &amp; CD ; data from fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org , and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , can be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second one . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD Edit@@ ors will be back and you see that the fields for the album is already covered with the comp@@ il@@ ateral data , which we recorded for the first piece . just enter the entries for the field of the piece . &quot;
Click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD ; entered .
attention : this window appears not when you have downloaded the data from Free@@ D@@ b . it is already sorted in one of these categories in the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed on the play list .
note that there is a check @-@ in before each line of a piece . only the titles are selected . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the play or make sure you select the button Show more pieces on the bottom edge of the screen to choose all the pieces at once .
&quot; by clicking on the button selection , read the read process , this window appears to confirm , and then we &apos;ll have a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; clicking on the tab for switching on the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check orders . the first piece is displayed on hard disk . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
this error message appears when you are trying to work with a body you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully coded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the contract list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the target folder are not what we have entered here in example . have you checked whether you have writing to the folder for temporary files and target folders ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now it is clear , why the error occurred directly after the end of the first volume . &quot;
&quot; the commission 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the coding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , reading and code parallel . please note the status item in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings to supp@@ ress these behavi@@ ors . the only thing that configur@@ able is the result is un@@ clear . when cutting machines , the result is un@@ clear . the calcul@@ ator with an am@@ d@@ 64 seems to have no problem with simultaneous reading and code ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last title is already read , while another piece is coded , and a third order in the qu@@ eue position is standing . after the last piece is encoded , a small window with a message appears in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; c@@ audi@@ o@@ .de ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.@@ x. or 4.x and cd@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or OGG , you need the code reading of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are already familiar with CV@@ S in the &amp; K@@ DE ; CV@@ S have already been able to download an anonymous package , since &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ Creator ; part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; package includes a part of an important &amp; K@@ DE ; if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to people , compiled from source files , and not intended for users to use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for assistance as the program can be adjusted for your needs , the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variations on settings . at best read the step by step for example to know the options and settings . it shows screenshot of the various flash@@ cards of the settings and also includes comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still reading right ? even if only the help menu has been cli@@ cked on the first time of the program , without any point it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program starts no audio CD ; in the drive ) , or from the unusual short menu ? &quot;
&quot; who reads this ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author can not reck@@ on this manual . it is as the first version to add or modify it , may it do . at least until contact with the author . and if you read this , he leave this section and agree with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange , if it succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; K@@ DE ; SV@@ N , you don &apos;t need this informative but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the Mi@@ di@@ - and kar@@ a@@ ok@@ esp@@ iel@@ er of &amp; K@@ DE ; besides others he did not have some properties that do not have other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players don &apos;t have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , thus , on all systems with O@@ SS - and &amp; K@@ DE ; support . &amp; k@@ mid ; also supports the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ asound project driver , which is used for G@@ US cards , as soon as it supports a Sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; shows the lyrics related to the screen with changing color , so it is easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag in &amp; K@@ DE ; every MIDI file from a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows on K@@ Mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( lyrics or text events ) . K@@ Mid determines the procedure automatically .
&quot; sitting support . if you finish &amp; K@@ DE ; during the playing of a song , K@@ Mid kicks off again with the same song again . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI syn@@ thesizer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first you can open ... from the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , which allows you to select the desired song . &quot;
you can also make a file of a &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ windows in the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with several songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and insert the button to play in the tool@@ bar , select the entry @-@ play from the menu item , or fill the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece automatically starts once you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; - window . ( in several pieces they will be added to a collection and then played one another . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; play a piece , you can jump to any job by using the middle mouse button and drive with the speed@@ controller and drive . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or slow down , you can click on the left and right of the Tem@@ plate . to get the original pace again , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : if a piece is played , there is a pressure on the space bar as a pressure on the button break or select the menu entry in the menu ) , interrup@@ ts the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
Lie@@ d@@ tex@@ te can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces apply lyrics , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can adjust what events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined , you will automatically adjust the kar@@ aoke text . but you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up a type of event , choose the Settings menu settings and lyrics . the same function also have the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you summar@@ ize . these are played the range after you . in this section , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find the menu collection below the point Organ@@ ise .... Click here to New and give the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy a existing collection by clicking on copying and then specify the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs like the original .
&quot; if you have more than a collection , you can set the settings in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not stored . concerns the if you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , she must be selected in the Collection Manager . there you can add the button Add a song . it appears in turn the file dialog , where you can select the desired song . &quot;
&quot; a second method to add a song , depends on the setting of automatic adding to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when automatic add to the collection is enabled , a piece for opening ( using file opening or drag &amp; drop ) is automatically added to the active collection . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection , it will be activated and emp@@ tied the temporary collection during opening a unit . this collection will then be added to the un@@ opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and select the desired song and then click on removal . &quot;
&quot; you can select the sequence in which the songs can be played , if you select the series after the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in sequence as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; if you add songs or remove a random order in the menu , the order is set new . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the select list on kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu , or press the button arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to jump back another song , select the button preceding pieces , the entry preceding piece from the menu , or press the button arrow left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click the button to delete . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , it doesn &apos;t matter if it is stored on leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; not stored . &quot;
&quot; this is necessarily necessary for syn@@ thesizer , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI @-@ events translated into events that syn@@ thesizer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI @-@ map that conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right piano in the type Change patch to tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ Map because all sound cards are GM compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM equipment and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI @-@ maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite dit@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI @-@ map is a text file , which stores all necessary conver@@ sions for the play of a piece . &quot;
&quot; each section may only appear once , except that KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . requirements for this , however , that each occurr@@ ence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... End De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of the Key@@ map &quot; ... End De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... end options ... End of the ... End
&quot; you see that De@@ fine is used to indicate that a section begins ( except for options ) and end , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can offer for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI compatible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , the patches of General MIDI is depicted on your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order , and also no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to lay all the sounds you need to put this instrument on the tone with the number M . if your keyboard does not support a tissue sample ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , you can do a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which can do the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( tissue signal ) , it will take Patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , ir@@ respective of which tone in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant to form a different perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ary instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ als , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always the same drum ( like some keyboards have ) . &quot;
KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as its presence . you need to create 128 entries . &quot;
&quot; for each channel , you can define multiple keyboard for each channel and you must only use different names in the first line . &quot;
Key@@ words are used mainly to map sounds on the per@@ k@@ ine channel . look for example the supplied keyboard maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels on others . if you want to share the first and second channel , you simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n is part of the channel that is depicted on the channel N . if you use the key@@ map option , you will need to change the key@@ map with the name name for this channel . if you are using the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will definitely try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x is used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful for example , to always use the per@@ k@@ ine patch on the per@@ k@@ ine channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio will be multiplied in which ratio of pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events will be multiplied . if so , a MIDI file will be converted with the value n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed to the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then be for@@ warded with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) so that in the map file there is no dec@@ im@@ als . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed , because GM is prescribed that a keyboard that is to play a pitch higher with the value 40@@ 96 to play a tone higher . unfortunately , some keyboards around two sounds want to play up to a oct@@ ave . to try the right value on your keyboard , you have to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , open the dialog MIDI settings . you can find in the menu below settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
&quot; the channel view is a window with a whole set of piano ( one for each MIDI channel ) . see these piano , which sounds just played . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel . for each channel , there is a select list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed a instrument , the button doesn &apos;t use more green but red , to indicate that no more the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to indicate the displayed tones . the view of the menu settings below the point of Kan@@ al@@ view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed , with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find a song be too fast to follow the text , you can slow down . to change the pace , use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played . it contains the scores , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc . therefore , the same MIDI file can lead to very different devices , just like two different musicians play the same scores in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; well , I cannot be able to force &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file needs 4 MB ( an compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good syn@@ thesizer . in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc . you have control of everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary ( rpm , de@@ b ) of &amp; k@@ mid ; that happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support , you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s homepage ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; understood , that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . simply open the folder you want to add into &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window . &quot;
&quot; before , enable the automatic adjustment to the collection in advance . otherwise , the files are added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can click the arrow keys from the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard temp@@ o you can click on the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; K@@ DE ; desktop computer with my MIDI file and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop , I have to play if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file , only switch into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window and move the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file without them equal to a collection , turn the setting Autom@@ ated adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ A.@@ C. First , you just want to play the first file . so adjust the default settings to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ d. your temporary collection , then it contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then join in to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection of all three files . how do you do that ?
these people have sent me MIDI files or postcards . all thank you ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard animated me on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ ders ; Lag@@ a ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ver@@ ; Lag@@ a . at the moment , I &apos;m not much free time for my hobbies , but I &apos;m trying to collect MIDI files , making music and sets phr@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where you can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files if you want a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; do , or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ un@@ mask @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; you really make me a huge pleasure when you send me a postcard from your residence or a Mi@@ di@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group . all of which send me a postcard or a MIDI file , you should contact me as if you want a MIDI file , as I might have the file already . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time , and get some money for it . I would therefore emphas@@ ize that I &apos;m getting more pro@@ gram@@ er because / if I get back feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) . &quot;

&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which can be found at htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . you can also look at the development , search information and look at the page . you can also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external syn@@ thesizer because the sound quality is essential from your sound card . it is not the same if you use an FM device or a AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have any sound@@ card , you have to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ V@@ I@@ SU@@ AL . it then runs as if you could not have a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , phon@@ o and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of the video files or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as playback of DVD s , VCD or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not finished yet as &amp; K@@ DE ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help , please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or send the question to The &amp; K@@ DE ; User mailing list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there &apos;s always the window with the central list . and finally , there is an information panel , which will only be displayed if information in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to add the preferred connections under the pop @-@ up menu , but these are single entries . if you want to create a list of entries , which should be played after each other , you should use the category permanent play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to receive an additional hier@@ arch@@ ate stage . if you balance an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and playback begins with the booked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; News &apos; , Television and Permanent play@@ list may also be changed through direct edit of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do if &amp; k@@ m@@ player / / / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / , can also select from the menu view and next edit a sub@@ group , only the XML content of this part is displayed . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you must be selected from the menu with play@@ list and selected either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes have been lost if the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the play@@ list .
&quot; following the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched through the changing XML configuration files . &quot;
the animation at the start and end can be disabled through the edit ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ through &#91; general Op@@ tions &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; will note the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format has to be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation when starting does not need to be short , it will automatically termin@@ ated through the opening of another source . this would be distur@@ bing in the end @-@ animation , therefore the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos ; &amp; lt ; ; lt ; ; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / lt ; / Recommend product testing / some examples of S@@ MIL developed by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ;
&quot; there is a rider for configur@@ ing M@@ Player within the configuration dialog of &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size can be set from the network and other things . &quot;
another tool for trou@@ bles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in the tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player visi@@ bly .
there is no rider for this res@@ etting device in configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured by manual editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . here is an example like a flash with the sw@@ f@@ de@@ c @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&quot; Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be inserted into the special field of Em@@ bed for YouTube , play@@ list XML . &quot;
&quot; in order to play the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the M@@ ime type application / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash can be specified in the assignment dialog file . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ quer@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is used in a consol@@ es application and after error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there is no mistakes , the back@@ end edition is called within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; to always have a given back@@ end for a specific m@@ ime type ( of course , only if this has been determined ) , this has to be done by manual changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play TV cards , either via M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this requires c@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be used , the device must be used to use the device and the TV channels , or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; for configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Data records ) settings in the k@@ m@@ player is the dialog to use in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video port . there should be ports in which one has to be found ( e.g. , PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name has probably included a DVB in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR can only use X@@ Video to work only X@@ Video ( probably this type of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . this is why the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . therefore , the vide@@ o@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional in its configuration file ( / etc / X11 / XF@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig . &quot;

can there be indications how to make my CD@@ ROM drive more qui@@ eter if I don &apos;t play from it ( not from the VCD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom is as user root as user to mount the device . it is absolutely sure to ensure that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive shows . &quot;

Q@@ T ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a library for C + + to create graphical user interfaces and network support and is used to comp@@ ile &amp; che@@ ile ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional correspondence application . under Unix @-@ type systems probably will be used on the package &amp; tex@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux ; distribution feature . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD is used .
the &amp; k@@ ile ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; c@@ ile ; for various distri@@ butions . these enable a simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are found on the c@@ ile ; web site .
&quot; this manual is available for everyone - independent of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; , &amp; K@@ DE ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users have to hardly read this manual . however , all proposals for documentation can be taken into consideration . if you wished to support this project or the documentation , the contact should be made via the c@@ ile ; web site . &quot;
any questions arise or comp@@ ile by &amp; k@@ ile ; on or are requested extensions , this should be addressed to the mailing list of c@@ ile @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; K@@ DE ; operating area . furthermore , &amp; k@@ ile ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs in a simple , direct and customized access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ programs . furthermore , the easy @-@ to @-@ use assistant , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate ; and his opportunities should learn the Hand@@ book to Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile ; can start there directly with reading the chapter , with the editor of &amp; Kate . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is the proper language : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . it is the possibility of use : L@@ ay @-@ TEC@@ H . it is also easy to use , can also be a lo@@ y ( engl@@ . lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; - a less sophisticated but real@@ ist@@ rate most sophisticated is that it is taken from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La mp@@ ort . &quot;
&quot; it is not the ultimate book to get to &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is not the ultimate book to be able to control , such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Prepar@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Us@@ ers , 3rd Edition , 1999 da@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the same as other recording languages includes &amp; lat@@ ex ; an introduction to which the gener@@ ously features such as paper format , side names and text gr@@ asp@@ per with the text . introduction that includes at least the command \ \ d { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ \ { document } . &quot;
the quick @-@ entry assistant to &amp; k@@ ile ; is a nice feature for the rapid creation of a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; the choice of the assistant offers some examples for the creation of the document . you can also use some of the document related settings .
&quot; document classes : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , article &#91; writing &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ c@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ book &#93; , projector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ t &#93; , projector &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ it &#93; or custom . &quot;
coding : this is how the character encoding is set . modern systems should increasingly use UTF @-@ 8 encoding as standard . if necessary UTF @-@ 8x should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ documents ) .
&quot; this list contains the usually used additional packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the connection , they only need to apply in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) , Letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Com@@ a Script ( to comply with German DIN instructions ) . you should always find the use of German text . &quot;
new users are not worried anymore . it is merely a brief description of functions and further information on this section .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers - just like other source code editors - the high@@ lighting of the commands , settings and elements ( as well as un@@ suitable ) . by &amp; c@@ ile it is possible to make sure some mathematical environment is not closed . however , it is possible to save some mathematical appearance of output file . however , you will save you through the up@@ lifting time and over . &quot;
&quot; using the automatic adjustment of environments , in input of a new command ( e.g. \ \ ) { command } ) of &amp; k@@ ile ; automatically generated a neutral line ( for entering the text ) and the da@@ wning line to the command settings ; setting up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands to be de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; the classification of the document in the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and sub@@ key element ) :
&quot; with the view of the document in the structural view , the single elements can be changed and viewed in a single click . &quot;
&quot; with the creation of your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ files may be very helpful . as soon as a DVI ; file &#91; rounded File &#93; &#93; was created , jumps &amp; c@@ ile ; by clicking with the medium mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI ; file contains a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and other information like the font , and is in addition to PDF the default output of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; there are many tools for view , conversion and printing of DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the ratio search , the elements of the DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked with the editor , and as soon as an element in the DVI ; -@@ file is cli@@ cked on the exact opposite of it . once upon a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code is cli@@ cked , it will be found in the DVI ; viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ Document : this function will be used in working with multiple files . using a Master @-@ document the work with other integrated .@@ tex files will be simplified . when using a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set up project settings .
quick construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result automatically displayed ( if no error occurred in the source code ) .
&quot; file surveillance : in this mode , the DVI ; -@@ file is called on the level market growth , and there is not a call from &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after rapid construction . &quot;
&quot; in view of the editing tool bar , the three major selection lists should be developed . the first selection field is for the fast input of the document in parts , chapters , sections , ... The ver@@ itable g@@ lat@@ ex ; commands for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the select box is for the purpose of articles such as keywords , mer@@ chandise , notes , or references . &quot;
&quot; name : with this command , a name for a section , a picture or different element is created . &quot;
reference : is used for reference to a fixed designation ( selection for selection box ) .
using quote is a select list with literary entries . at &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; this only works if the file is needed for a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; the &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; files are also known in &amp; c@@ ile ; written by hand .
&quot; the final selection field with the name of the font is used for the definition of the font . it can be specified for the main text , the notes , notes etc . &quot;
when the call of &amp; k@@ ile are two selection of choice : 1 . the assistant for creating a new document by selecting the document art and the legend of the settings . 2 . the document can be written by hand .
&quot; the bra@@ ckets on the command \ \ _ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12 pt &#93; sets the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this may also happen to the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source text must be compiled ; the easiest way to this is the use of the construction or button of quick construction . &quot;
the source code must be saved before comp@@ ile . &amp; c@@ ile ; for storing the storage automatically .
&quot; the compilation of the document should be searched for errors . when using quick construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the log@@ ging should also be considered . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text that is treated differently than the remaining document . for example , a report with the font size should have been created . the command \ \ , { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } . &quot;
the changes are made only within the area ( of \ \ ) { environment } to \ \ &apos; ( environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the population within a environment .
&quot; there are many examples to be available to read the legi@@ bility and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fon@@ ts , fatty pressures , short print , sub@@ cut@@ ters , etc. are added . these commands are either using the command \ \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
&quot; \ \ a { emp@@ h } : this command is for the course of care and is long as long as possible , until it is closed with a \ \ \ { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a proposition can be presented with \ \ emp@@ h { word } . &quot;
\ \ quota : creates a quote in the document . quote begins with \ \ a { quota } and ends with \ \ \ { quota } .
&quot; after the background to writing the source code with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; recording language was presented , now follows a step @-@ in @-@ step instructions for creating a document in &amp; c@@ ile ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wi@@ z@@ ard a bit text was entered , a few adjustment for the better read@@ ability of the document should be carried out . to this end , minim@@ ally should be quote , a few places in the adi@@ - and cur@@ sive print and a poem to the application to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , it can be returned to the editor that can be returned to the editor ( with an internal viewer ) . at an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI ; file has been created , the document can be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
DVI ; is a rounded file format ( English D e V ice I n@@ dependent ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for the reading of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of the .d@@ vi copy like printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ converting or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI ; file the same steps are visible as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after the click on DVI , then the document can be printed using file print ( in the viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; tool@@ bar is the conversion of DVI ; file into different formats . as soon as the DVI ; file from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source was created , the conversion to convert different formats can begin using the P@@ FE in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the pre @-@ search seek the direct jump from the editor to the da@@ wning position within the DVI ; file .
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; offers a corresponding adjustment for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; binary files . to this , merely have to set up modern settings of settings ... Tools shall be recycled . &quot;
&quot; in order to find out the need for the need , the mouse poin@@ ter must be positioned in a line of source tex@@ tual and close to prior reservation . the jump to the appropriate place in DVI ; viewer is then carried out . &quot;
with this feature in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with a click of the medium mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ document of &amp; c@@ ile ; p@@ added and corresponding to the corresponding line . this has to be defined as text editor ( Settings ey@@ epi@@ ece ... Editor )
&quot; if using quick construction of the &amp; DVI ; viewer , there should be an error . should be a mistake , this is displayed in the protocol file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the protocol error contains the error source in the source code . in the editor , the P@@ FE forecast for La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used between the errors , and the protocols may be cli@@ cked down to the error in the protocol and will jump to the wrong line . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the button bar is cli@@ cked on the tool@@ bar , a window to choose from the template for the document . the default things are : &quot;
if you choose from empty document a document can be written either from the reason to re @-@ written or the assistant to the fast creation of a new document . further information is included in the section .
&quot; capacity of users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates are in &amp; c@@ ile ; created , stored and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file can be done or create a new file . you can create a new template using an existing document , and choose from file template . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a new document , some strings are replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in settings and settings ... &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings of which variables will be replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by the input in document class . typically they are used as follows : \ \ chart &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLAS@@ S@@ PT@@ ION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est way to create a template is the use of the assistant and the associated entry for the commands in the editor . once the document was created , the following steps were accomplished : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , you can then expand its own template instead of the standard field . &quot;
a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files are created . a simple way to create a template should be searched after one in the internet and searched under the steps described below .
&amp; k@@ ile ; used &amp; Kate ; as an internal editor . &amp; Kate ; is a text editor for programm@@ ers with the possibility of reading and her@@ b@@ ating from many different types of text files ( including &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; Bi@@ b@@ Te@@ x ; ) . many settings can be done directly from &amp; che@@ ile .
&quot; to learn more about &amp; Kate , and to learn about the heroes at Kate . users of &amp; k@@ ile are invited directly to the reading of the chapter with the editor of &amp; Kate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be called for the menu Help La@@ Te@@ X reference . it contains a description of almost all commands that can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pushed C@@ tr@@ l key to expand the &amp; tex ; it means that this way on the right hand on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ authenti@@ ski@@ p is only \ \ par .
&quot; when pulling the text , the added text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys , the printed parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; has the opportunity to browse the different types of source codes and emphas@@ ize them . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical form@@ ul@@ as are highlighted by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assist@@ ants belong to the jump stamp . this is a unique type of book@@ marks inside the text . this jump stamp is emphas@@ ized , so that this jump brand will be highlighted in the first input of a character automatically . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program such as &amp; k@@ ile ; though &amp; Kate ; already outstanding fe@@ ats , have been added in &amp; c@@ ile ; important functions for the writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; source codes for their selection . under Edit are the following commands include the text @-@ code : &quot;
&quot; it includes a whole paragraph ( group of lines , which included on both sides a blank line ) . this advanced meaning does not connect tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source texts . this means that the par@@ agra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; the word under the current cur@@ sor position . this option also has an extended meaning , since this command is also called &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a limited capacity ( \ \ ) and a limited star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to read a part of the document , the first line of the document can be removed and by pressing the button C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; K@@ ile ; offers with its own commands , which include the following commands to view the text : &quot;
&quot; remove a whole paragraph . the definition for a sales in &amp; c@@ ile , is contained in the description on distribut@@ ing constra@@ ints sales . &quot;
it has been clear that environments is a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; play . that &apos;s why &amp; k@@ ile ; for further orders under Edit environment for a beautiful simple job with &amp; lat@@ ex ; .
&quot; with this command , the cur@@ sor will be placed in the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly before the command to the open environment . &quot;
&quot; with this command , the cur@@ sor will be placed at the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the command to close the area . &quot;
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is located before or within the command \ \ , { Sur@@ ro@@ undings } , the end of the environment will be in@@ jected ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; in the input of many snow@@ sho@@ ok environment commands , the view can be lost quickly . this command finally shut down the last surrounding area , so that the anti @-@ poll@@ uted environment structure is not broken . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ile ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by bra@@ ckets { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that meet from working environment . &quot;
this command will be placed at the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor will be placed directly in front of the welded clip .
this command will be termin@@ ated at the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cur@@ sor is placed directly behind the twi@@ sted cl@@ aws .
&quot; if the cur@@ sor is before or behind the soft@@ ening of a &amp; tex , group # is , will be accompanied by the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many snow@@ sho@@ cks , groups bra@@ ckets can also be lost quickly . this command finally slept the last group , so that the closed structure of the &amp; tex ; groups cannot be broken . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple input marks used as a model . for the purpose of purpose is used in &amp; c@@ ile ; for example , the sign &quot; is used . &quot; &amp; c@@ ile ; knows this case and leads two close approach to the lat@@ ex . &quot;
this automatic adjustment of double instructions can be set under settings of K@@ ile ... La@@ Te@@ X .
there are also different specific settings ( e.g. wet or French ) and there@@ with German or fran@@ ç@@ al approach . there are also many other languages available .
&quot; in case of shift Shift ; Re@@ duc@@ ts for &amp; c@@ ile ; a smart line breaks . in case the current position is located within a lists of environment ( e.g. , f@@ um@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , leads &amp; c@@ ile ; not just a line breaks , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a tables , close the line with \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
even better - &amp; k@@ ile ; is intelligent enough to support pre @-@ made &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user defined environments . these can be added below settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables and thereby arrange all E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . if this tab@@ ulator is not to be able to encourage you . although this tab@@ ulator is not the da@@ wning , for columns position in the current tab@@ ulator . &quot;
&quot; even though &amp; Kate already offers a good source code completion , this in &amp; k@@ ile ; for some special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are still expanded . all of these modes are available for different work settings . all of these modes are available for different work settings ... Res@@ ult . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment is done using the &quot; \ \ &quot; { surroundings } &amp; c@@ ile command ; automatically add the command \ \ to { surroundings } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; while pressing the trunk , the last letter of the input will be removed and mis@@ erable , therefore , the list may also shr@@ ink from entering a further letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameters . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; c@@ ile ; alternatively a jump to these positions is available , so that simply jump to these positions by means of exec@@ uting jump brand . &quot;
&quot; att@@ un@@ ting settings ; setup ... k@@ ile ; complete settings to these lists can be done . it can be done different kinds of choice for &amp; tex ; - und &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , well as well as well as the general voice of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not appropriate for completion of environments . on the other hand , there are always a few letters with \ \ , a large list with environmental commands will be entered . on the other hand , environments will be used as often that &amp; c@@ ile ; a special mode for completion of environments is used . &quot;
&quot; when calling the ful@@ fill@@ ment mode , the Men@@ Ã ¼ s@@ zel Alt + Shift key Space , the command to open the environment will be automatically con@@ founded and it appears in \ \ . afterwards , the environment is continued to be sim@@ pl@@ est and by pressing the input . &quot;
&quot; once this is accomplished , the environment will be closed automatically . once &amp; c@@ ile ; recogni@@ zes that it is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item orders will be installed . &quot;

&quot; ile &amp; k@@ ile ; support user defined lists of waste cuts , which can be replaced immediately by l@@ Ã ² strings . as an example of a past@@ oral list , the file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl is included in the example of the associated entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word contained error will be entered by the menu ( C@@ tr@@ l + Alt Space ) , the letter L will be replaced by the string of \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; big we@@ aries are not helpful for the automatic adjustment of per@@ missions . however , it has been found that many whales were written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; c@@ ile ; the completion for everyone has already been written . &quot;
&quot; in the menu settings , this mode can be shot down ... K@@ ile publishers are shot down . here , also the swelling value can be specified for the placement of completion . &quot;

&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but also offer an outstanding basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is re@@ plen@@ ished , the pages with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools are re@@ arranged and then be converted with ps@@ 2@@ pdf into a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to understand the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed into the menu creation comp@@ ile , creating conversion and creation . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewers such as &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used with Alt ; 2 ; then , the DVI ; file is converted into a PS file via Alt ; 4 the DVI ; file into a PS file and by Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the command quick@@ est , a viewer is usually called to comp@@ ile . if no embedded viewer is used , there will be a new window each time . &quot;
a new project will be added to the new project .... Hier@@ in will provide the following information for the project :

the script function of &amp; k@@ ile ; allows the script of EC@@ MAS@@ cript -@@ code . scripts can be administ@@ rated in the vertical gro@@ unding .
the API scripts are not yet developed and can be found in other versions of &amp; c@@ ile ; even more .

&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is supposed to be named , the file will usually be stored in their home file . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ in , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you have to do with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you may not benefit from the additional functionality now and must not wait until someone uses the desired in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can find plug@@ ins in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . read more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a Plug@@ in or a K@@ Part , we start working with the menu plug @-@ in . thus , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
this dialogue allows you to manage all contained plug @-@ ins and add new products . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element in it :
here you can enter the search path . adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often working on a project several people work in a form of hier@@ arch@@ ical relationship . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the classification of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . Nick@@ name is the nickname of user and serves for unique identification .
&quot; one member can have several roles in the project , such as team leader as well as Sub@@ project ladder . &quot;
&quot; the user may look out of the list of te@@ amm@@ ates , who it is . this happens by searching the team member from the list , and the button S@@ etze as presses . the currently selected member ( their identification ) appears bold as you are : text . &quot;
nickname and attitude of your own identity are important regarding news and comments . see for further information on notes .
&quot; in addition to the overview of her team , there is another advantage of the capture of the members of the team : it may be made an event for information to the team leader when something specific happens . see in for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed if something specific in the project happens . an example would be the opening of opening and closing of the project , so much anyone else has worked , or the sending of a message if a file is saved , or one script which will add to the CV@@ S , as soon as it will be added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page event configuration of Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an e @-@ mail will be sent to the add@@ res@@ h@@ ates in the receiver list . the add@@ sat can be a team or sub @-@ project leader . see in B@@ we@@ i such ladder can be arranged .
notes are special comments in documents . they differ from normal comments through the following things :
notes is easy . it can be selected either the note menu in the context menu or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key word in a comm@@ ent@@ ar@@ box followed by Comment text .
notes can be sent to a decisive member of the team . in this case the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( Role ) is a role in the project consisting of the following possibilities : team leader Ber@@ eich@@ s@@ head Sub@@ project leader after the en@@ rich@@ ment and sub @-@ project leaders should be specified as in the examples below .
&quot; nickname and roles names are independent of large or small projec@@ tions , but spaces around the stap@@ les and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a development environment for scri@@ p@@ ting and form@@ att@@ ing languages supported DT@@ D @-@ ag@@ nost@@ ic and web @-@ based form@@ att@@ ing and scri@@ p@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . only about &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for others may be found in . &quot;
the settings can be accessed using settings of Qu@@ anta ... This dialog covers some pages that are treated with each other .
&quot; the behaviour of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; concerning tag , including car coverage , can thus be changed . entries are : &quot;
&quot; large / Klein@@ sch@@ y of tags : large / Klein@@ sch@@ y of automatic tags . normal children / Klein@@ sch@@ en@@ ue means , tags will be inserted as they are described in the daily XML files . &quot;
large / Klein@@ sch@@ l@@ ure of attributes : large / small notes of automatically added attribute . normal children / Klein@@ sch@@ en@@ ue means that attributes are inserted as they are described in the daily XML files .
&quot; optional tags : if attached , it is optional , for which the final day is optional , this immediately after finishing ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; not optional tags : as above , for all other tags , with the exception of simple tags . &quot;
&quot; start and end day automatically : when switched on , the closing day will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic detection of accent : controls the automatic conversion of acute characters into the respective coding during the typ@@ ing .
M@@ IM@@ E types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . the default default settings can be restored .
standard string encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening files ( where the coding of the file can be approached ) . but this attitude will be captured by the same in the project characteristics if a project is charged .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . however , this attitude will be captured from the same in the project characteristics if a project is charged . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; created regularly backup copies , so that in a blackout or crash when the next start of the program can re@@ produce the document from this backup . this is not the same as the save file . even for still not stored documents will be a backup regular , according to the set time . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be shown either in the Edit@@ or@@ Area or of its own view ( or documentation in a cart@@ ei@@ re@@ iter ) , which makes it possible to watch the documentation , the preview and the source code simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; set the window settings back to the next start , when the user interface has come through through the M@@ DI @-@ Mo@@ di and and@@ o@@ cks / depending on views . it is equivalent to the --@@ res@@ et@@ Layout Editor element . &quot;
the warning message range is to control the possibility of turning war@@ nings by al@@ ha@@ ken by non @-@ questions .
the place around the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; to change . it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the synchron@@ ization of the V@@ PL@@ - and source view in divided mode . regarding the different modes .
&quot; here , the par@@ ser and the structural tree , which depic@@ ts the picture of the Par@@ ser @-@ node in detail , can be set in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structural tree , it is possible to change the action caused by clicking the structural building with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the field of structural tree settings , the visibility of the tree can be opened automatically and how deep in a change of the structural tree is to be opened . empty knots are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are not found in which the current document could not be found . &quot;
&quot; the area for the installation of abbrevi@@ ations ( a kind of templates ) that are un@@ folded when working on extensive text . abbrevi@@ ations are valid in groups , each can be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; it may be valid for several &amp; DT@@ EP ; it may be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ ade abbrevi@@ ation means something else than in a group valid for Jav@@ as@@ cript . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins can be managed here . plug@@ ins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled use , at the most known &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; . inser@@ tion of a plug @-@ in must be specified : &quot;
&quot; address : the path to plug@@ in , if it is not in a stand there like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; input : this information will be delivered to the plug @-@ in , so it can open the current file , the associated file ( path of the current file ) or the repository folder . &quot;
&quot; charging component in the &quot; Only @-@ L@@ esis &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is ref@@ using . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse to load the store , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : is this enabled , then testing &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the given information is correct . if the insert is not available , then if the plug@@ in is not available in the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , the trou@@ bles@@ hooting has been completely re@@ designed , and the support for the d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead of its support for d@@ b@@ g Deb@@ ug@@ ger . instead , a deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in concept has been implemented , which allows various implem@@ ent@@ ations via plug @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; currently , only a plug @-@ in is available to support the use of &amp; g@@ ub@@ ed ; in@@ quant@@ ap@@ lus ; insert . &quot;
the use of the deb@@ ug@@ gers for a project begins with selecting a matching deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ ins in the project settings . with the button options next to the deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in selection box can be changed to specific settings .
&quot; if a deb@@ ug@@ ger is activated , some additional elements appear in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of supervised variables is displayed . usually appears on the left side .
a view in which all holding points are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
a view in which the output is shown ( as in HTML ) of the deb@@ ug@@ gers . usually appears in the lower Do@@ ck .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bug , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will be connected to Deb@@ ug@@ ger , if necessary , manufactured , or it divi@@ des the Plug@@ in to listen to Deb@@ ug@@ ger . this action will be executed by default , so that a deb@@ ug@@ ger is not necessary , so that in the normal case do not have to be considered . &quot;
the counter to Deb@@ ug@@ gen session Star@@ te the session . closes the connection to Deb@@ ug@@ ger or stops the Lau@@ rence to Requi@@ re@@ ments .
send an HTTP requirement to the server to initi@@ ate a Deb@@ ug requirement . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to see the current document . the output of this request is displayed in deb@@ ug@@ ger output .
&quot; will comm@@ end the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script and to date information about the supervised variables as well as the current executed line is continued . if this happens , the execution is continued before a de@@ bug requirement is started , the script starts with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; will comm@@ end the deb@@ ug@@ ger to start with the execution of the script , without information to super@@ vis@@ ing variables and the current form number . if this happens when a script was given , the execution will start when a de@@ bug requirement is granted . &quot;
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger leads the next instruction in the script , without going to enter the functions or include . &quot;
&quot; the deb@@ ug@@ ger introduces the next instruction in the script , whereby it is possible to work in functions and includes . &quot;
&quot; follow the deb@@ ug@@ ger to walk the instruction and go to the next , as if the current is not . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or an expression may be entered , which should be monitored . the super@@ vis@@ ing value appears in the variable view . &quot;
&quot; with this dialog , a variable can be entered or a new value of a variable . &quot;

this chapter describes how to adapt &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to adapt to your needs and how to help you &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; can help to become better .
&quot; type of editing packages ( DT@@ EP ; s ) are used in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and script languages , as well as CSS ; you enable &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; skills such as car rental and glu@@ ing rooms ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developer , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s exist in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages and CSS ; . &amp; DT@@ EP ; s consist of two types , the tag folder and the tool@@ bars . tag file contain two data types , the text and instructions faster into a document , as a user may ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; DT@@ EP ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see in details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create Tag@@ XML files , then the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , a &amp; DT@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atu@@ res@@ dialog@@ es , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; even . tool@@ bars enable a quick end of tags in a document without any risk of writing . &quot;
&quot; day folder are not known as folder . they contain only the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . day folder bear the name of the descri@@ b@@ able language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; table below lists the elements of the Tag@@ XML on and declare whether they are necessary , or not . although not all are necessary , it is wise to use as many as possible , so that other users have a better view and more information at work with them . &quot;
&quot; the following chapter describes every element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits shall be placed in a simple way . &quot;
&quot; that is the root element of a day XML document . it may contain only once in a document , but it can contain the definition of many tags , but it is otherwise nothing else . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only for the Type Method . gives the name of the class to where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and the attributes within this tags can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . that is a single element type element .
&quot; describes a attribute of tag . this element can only be described once for any attribute . additionally , it contains the names and the type of attribute . additionally , it contains further tags that will describe as this attribute will be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
&quot; when used , there are source codes for the attributes in the tag editor and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to reach the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method@@ ology name within &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a section and a method@@ ology . the arguments that will be transferred to the method . may be empty or % tag name % , that means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a box tag allows the elements of a list together . it can only occur for an attribute description only once . it is an only element type element .
tables an tags within a dialog . this day may occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
returns the position and size of a field within dialogue . this day should be present for each field within dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
&quot; there is a list of elements , which may occur within the desired tags . this element is an only element type . &quot;
there is a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UTF @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces influence nothing but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ This &gt; , and &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to review the Tag@@ XML files , the tools are available in the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ windows to start and transfer day X@@ ML@@ . to choose . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is not yet available yet . at present , check the check of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , respectively . &quot;
&quot; in the following , an example for a family 1 day XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; ELE@@ MENT to the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; sch@@ ema . the fil@@ en@@ ame for this day XML file is to be schem@@ atic . &quot;
&quot; in the following , an example of a functional family 2 day XML file . in this file , a &amp; PHP ; over@@ lap function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this day XML file is supposed to be over@@ lo@@ ad@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UTF @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; string &quot; type = &quot; optional &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt;
the file descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is also quite simple and there is an editor that can be accessed via DT@@ D edit DT@@ D settings ; therefore di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a new created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; for a newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; to create a simple &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries are :
&#91; General &#93; version = uses 1 for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D indication . ( - / / W@@ 3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / EN ) Nick@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional ) . if not specified it is used as a nickname .
a action can set up actions with settings ... click on New Action leads to the same dialogue :
this promotion is assigned to the button . using the button user can be assigned a key pendant ; with K@@ one is the current short@@ key .
&quot; the sim@@ pl@@ est actions . it can be entered into the det@@ ective settings and inserted in the execution of the action , this text is inserted in the document on the current cur@@ sor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts but it is not limited ) that will change the document or as input ( or parts of the document ) , are started . examples of quick start -@@ dialogue or the various See in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML DT@@ EPs . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ home / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh .
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scri@@ pt@@ thee variable in command line , such as sh % scri@@ pt@@ thee / my@@ Scri@@ pt@@ .@@ sh@@ . in their path : $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H It is other special variable , which can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : in case of a local document , we will replace the file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : if using the P@@ ID of the current &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; process replaced . if from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance runs , the text will be added to the P@@ ID number . this is useful if D@@ COP is used to control &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the fil@@ en@@ ame of the current document or path to the repository file . &quot;
in addition to the listed methods there can be a script input of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the default entry can be specified . in the selection box input can be determined what is to be sent to the default settings . possibilities are :
selected text : the selected section of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually useful with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the executed application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output : normal edition , which is written to the standard edition ; error messages , which should be written to the standard edition written by default , by the value the select box output is set : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to create the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create the tags in logical groups . in the case there is not too many , therefore you can create a tool bar with the name of the market . &quot;
&quot; once a tool bar is added , you need to add actions and configure . select settings . &quot;
the parts of this window are quite self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the lower end of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all necessary fields and add it to the appropriate tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day Attri@@ butes and you are planning their use , activate dialogue &quot; Day , &quot; if available , to enter a input when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ug@@ ly symbol . who should note the action in conjunction with this symbol ? we will replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action represents better , we will use &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; select from the &amp; k@@ menu ; , graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ ic@@ one@@ dit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , choose edit size . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; DT@@ EP ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day start , I decided to create a starting button as a symbol . by using green ( green will usually be interpreted as los , stiff , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user is sign@@ aled ; start@@ up ; -@@ tag in current document will be added . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens across the menu with settings and setting actions ... ( in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . next to the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder , where the stored symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the button and put them on with other tags , so there is , or confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual and quant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for tool bar , or it should be divided these for a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . make sure that the desired tool bar will be chosen . &quot;
&quot; I would like to choose the Tren@@ ner ( very left above ) for my tool bar . after selecting the Elem@@ entary , which should be added to the tool bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to select a quick way to access the con@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note how to support the separation of the group . someone , who doesn &apos;t know my tool bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button . &quot;
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by tasting all the symbols in order to ensure that everything works .
&quot; in the correct folder . after new@@ e@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the correct folder , but your tool bar ( s ) should be loaded in the correct folder , so that your tool bar ( s ) will be loaded when a file is opened by the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users , the possibility to add documentation for script language or form@@ att@@ ing language that you like to enjoy . therefore , this chapter describes how I use a &amp; PHP ; document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you could check in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory if anyone already has done for you . &quot;
there are two parts in this process . first you need to create an existing documentation for the form@@ att@@ ing / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . we must leave the first part to you to do the second here .
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = arrow , relative to this file , for example ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top element = your description for these document@@ ations e.g. &amp; PHP ; 4.2 , paragraph 2 = # 1 , tag@@ 2 = trimm@@ ing day 1 = binding 2.@@ html tag@@ s.@@ l. &quot;
&quot; section tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the document tree . for example , you can now see in the &amp; PHP ; documentation so somewhat : &quot;
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Do@@ c you = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2
note the # before G@@ etting Start@@ ed and Language Reference . this shows that it is about sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for chess tel@@ ev@@ ade ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequently the upper end of the Bau@@ man@@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ) file is displayed ! ) .
&quot; spaces influence nothing , but watch out &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; all c@@ end@@ ons should be replaced . &quot;
&quot; the section of this section is the range of do@@ cr@@ c file that will be shown to shapes the con@@ tex@@ tual help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script for context @-@ help would be displayed directly . there are only two types of entries here : the context List ( Cont@@ ext@@ List ) and file binding . &quot;
a simple list of conf@@ using separate context @-@ elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; this is the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can simply save your file do@@ cr@@ c and go to $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / apps / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc / qu@@ anta / doc / doc@@
&quot; if you are sure that this good and it is worth , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation were used to the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Rep@@ os@@ it@@ ory for use by the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Community . you will not be rich , but proud to be with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you are not alone . it is possible to share the separate resources ( DT@@ EP packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via email to friends , partners or else to whom . in different places there is an email menu entry , such as DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) with email , tool tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can be downloaded and only re@@ adily available if our team needs them as correct and us@@ eless for the publication , for which there is a G@@ PG / P@@ GP key . thus , the source of resources will be ensured for our team as well as for the future users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you will be asked after their Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for their private G@@ PG key ( the Pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase will not be stored ) , or in the case you have several keys you can stay in . in the dialog New resource ( URL @-@ preview can be empty ) and with clicking OK the up@@ loading will be started . &quot;
upload the upload DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( DT@@ EP ) to upload tool@@ bars tool bar and can be started in the context menu of files and folders in the templates and scripts .
&quot; after downloading a resource , nor before installation , examined &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by testing the integrity and the significance . in the case of problems , it may be broken . if the integrity was given and the resource is correct , a message appears with the statement of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML languages , which is currently not supported by &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; it may be time consuming because hundreds of day files might be necessary in daily XML format . it gives the easier way to convert DT@@ D automatically into a DT@@ EP package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D store and Conver@@ ting of a DT@@ D menu . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with DT@@ D description , which should be used . afterwards , the following dialog appears : &quot;
objective name : the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p file .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE Defin@@ itions : the string that will appear in the DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE tag such as HTML PU@@ BL@@ IC - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loos@@ e.@@ d@@ t@@ d
&quot; after conversion , the DT@@ EP &apos;s fine adjustment after conversion : when enabled , brings &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; DT@@ EP ; it is recommended to use this possibility . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and full benefit from &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , you have to bring to these fundamental concepts , without whose understanding &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; little benefits they might bring . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the working area is divided into three areas : global , locally and project management . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; uses , available . from tool@@ bars over actions , everything is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; saved . this allows the group of administ@@ rators different tools to ass@@ ure actions and patterns in a global tree that is available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
&quot; local items include a personal collection of web development agents for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in user directory , so they can only use these users personally . &quot;
&quot; project @-@ related elements are available only within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS ; designs up to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simple , this is the most limited size . all elements are filed in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ bodies the common use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ um lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some main areas : the Edit@@ or@@ window , the Bau@@ haus , the flash@@ cards with information and the tool@@ bars . please strike in and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click to obtain a context menu with the right mouse button to obtain a context menu with the current document , such as some of the current , other or all boxes , restart , del@@ eting or upload of document , jump to an book@@ marks or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click menu in the editor area lead to another context menu , regarding basic processing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , editing the word under the mouse poin@@ ter or opening the file , if the string is called under the mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor , the Edit@@ ors of Edit@@ ors are located . currently , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Trans@@ itional will be shown as standard , for which a set of tool@@ bars are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and thus linked user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars are really easy . if they want to insert a simple day , e.g. &amp; lt ; if you want to insert into your document , then click on the icon which has several attributes ( such as anch@@ ors ) , you can fill in a dialog by various fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) enable it to navigate the information on &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate them and through . in the presentation with ant@@ it@@ re@@ it@@ ers are available for files , project , pattern template , document structure , scripts , attributes and document@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool , the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; prepared . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as add , removing , upload or delete the files from the storage medium can be done with the displayed Con@@ text menu . &quot;
&quot; another option of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : images , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what connection they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are available only for the relevant users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about available script languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project will also work here . by clicking on the left mouse button you can retri@@ eve the available information to a script . via the right mouse button other functions are available , such as the script will start , edit or send via email . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left @-@ click of an element , the cur@@ sor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ click of an element , a list of commands in relation to navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among other buildings . with it , man@@ fast attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . this is possible to change the contents of all available attributes with a few cli@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; here is the full documentation on web technology for your development . it can be downloaded set @-@ packed documentation for &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; document site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be edited , edited and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; two cart@@ ei@@ re@@ ites at the lower end of the window , about the beneficial information can be reached : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
this cart@@ ei@@ re@@ on displays information about each in Qu@@ anta running script . for example the DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to DT@@ D are displayed .
&quot; this cart@@ ei@@ re@@ on displays all errors in the current document . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensive and easy to understand . show it on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define your own commands as symbols in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to define . &quot;
&quot; a further function of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with e@@ Mail . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool bar in an e @-@ mail , you can back these in &amp; quant@@ um ; like any other secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you can adjust the number of options to get to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options to understand . / configure --@@ help . these options are easy to understand and not executed here .
if you have problems when starting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; you should check if your path contains the &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 bin file . also you should ensure that no older version of &amp; K@@ DE ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H are located in front of their bin folder . same applies to &amp; Q@@ t .
&amp; quantitative lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimised for a rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful features .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML ; editor , the developers of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus began to employ : what if &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; an independent , ext@@ end@@ able market @-@ up languages ? well , this would make him an absolutely great web development tool for &amp; K@@ DE ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; not longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; now wide on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summar@@ ized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; it should be &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; therefore , the suitable &amp; IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , at the above claim must be held that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding effort of the entire &amp; K@@ DE ; development community is not only possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; quant@@ um lus ; to expand how they need it for their need . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; enables web developments to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can increase productivity almost every task . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars ; extend without any scri@@ p@@ ting of a script . ( more about them find them in . ) &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it has been designed for a fast web development , and quickly expanded to a sophisticated editor with many powerful features . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in any way associated with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta . the original developer left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
more into the detailed documentation is help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL into &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; enter or use a help@@ center help : / qu@@ anta run ) .
&amp; qu@@ anta is currently developed and supported by Eric L@@ aff@@ ix Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as MAN@@ T@@ IA am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a fast access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time if you open a file , which is not included , whereby the oldest record is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for the later use . check out in the section about templates . should they try to save the selected file / text outside of the local / project generator , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; converted to inser@@ tion from the clip@@ board , special characters contained in the &amp; HTML ; -@@ bills , that they are correctly displayed and not understood by the browser as form@@ att@@ aching . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write , which is the correct way to insert a special characters and space character in &amp; URL ; s . primarily used to insert and URL ; s in the anchor @-@ day . &quot;
&quot; switches off the block selection and / off . that allows you to choose text blocks with the help of Shift &amp; Shift ; click . &quot;
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful if your &amp; PHP ; script error messages exist !
search a string or regular expression in selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
&quot; displays the message window , or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scripts and deb@@ ug@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; - and switching off the problem rep@@ orters at the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window , the problem reporter will be activated once you changed to the structural tree . &quot;
shows the symbol stamp to the left from the main window . this column allows you to book@@ store with a mouse click .
&quot; when this book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with entries preceding or next , depending on the position of cur@@ sor in the document . &quot;
Bookmark the book@@ marks in the menu will be group@@ ed according to the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; quant@@ um lus ; projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches , the project directory for new files that might be there . that allows , for example , copying files in your project folder or folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
&quot; downloads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) . &quot;
&quot; settings , such as &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project manages . in Chapter &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects you can find details . &quot;
invites a repository tool . these are stored in the project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu when you assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bars . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the names . actions must be saved through settings , and you will be asked by using tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool bar from the visual range . if you do not delete the tool bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
so you can send your own tool bar to someone ( perhaps at the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) team that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu option opens a new e @-@ mail message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; to upload tool@@ bars to the main server , where each other can access it . see also . &quot;
invite a &amp; DT@@ D ; that you or anyone else has made and convert into the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description formats .
&quot; upload / gr@@ asp@@ ing of entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it is useful if the entities from the &amp; DT@@ EP ; to renew it without the whole &amp; DT@@ EP ; if this global is not present in the global K@@ DE file , the shop will fail . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are currently loaded on the currently loaded tool bars . if the Standard ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
allow access to the current day setting dialog if there is one . this entry is always available in the menu tags followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific under@@ men@@ ities .
activ@@ ates or disabled the smart insert tags . currently this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ tion means that &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; the insert by tool bar may be denied if this day is ref@@ using to this place .
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the above menu button . Click the click of a activated plug @-@ in . &quot;
select the value added mode for the current file . the list of available revision schem@@ ata depends on the makes ; -@@ version .
&quot; choose the type of line identification . very useful if you know people who use other OS platforms to develop . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
check the syntax of the current document on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; with external application .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , the switch@@ gear may cause some time or un@@ nice graphics . it is recommended to be the default mode , or the default setting mode , which is the representation in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains one entry for each open window . with selecting a contract , the corresponding window will be activated . &quot;
switches off the status bar on the lower edge of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window at or from .
&quot; changes in this dialogue influences any application which use the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web brows@@ ers . &quot;
make the behaviour of the editor &apos;s behavior . in the Doc@@ umentation of &amp; Kate ; you find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ bars , or to change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should create assistance in accordance with the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and free of charge but as with any open source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; quant@@ um ; -@@ evolution in financial form you will find here the way .
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed at the best from above , as for example after filling the project named the whole directory structure for the rest of the project will be completed later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project features can be set . &quot;
&quot; here &apos;s the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has stored the name of the project in small letters and without spaces using the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
here you can access the server address of the machine to which you want to access local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible .
&quot; when you use this field empty , default settings will be used . depending on the remote computer setting , an adaptation may be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder , where the tool@@ bars for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files are used for different projects , this file should be set instead of the standards . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local file system into the project . several files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . with ser@@ ver@@ side scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc . ) you need to go elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; consider when files , which are located somewhere in the main folder of the project , are supposed to be integrated . if a project is started ane@@ w . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders will be displayed within the main folder and you can make a precise selection of good work . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by an@@ ha@@ ken or , by removing the c@@ ass , cl@@ amps out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project assist@@ ants contains three settings that simpli@@ fy your work . these settings can also be instantly upload or instantly with the project features in the menu space in the sub @-@ window profiles or using the button Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the project assistant and are described in detail . additional entries are explained below .
a list of file names ( plac@@ eholders are possible ) that will be re @-@ read for project @-@ related operations such as project file .
&quot; complem@@ entary option on top , also files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ signals are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which will be loaded when opening the project . in order to read more about project perspectives . &quot;
&quot; so you can choose the desired Deb@@ ug@@ ger . currently , only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . deb@@ ug@@ ger plug@@ in can be set up with the button options . in this case , trou@@ bles@@ hooting is described . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom @-@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set as well as the display of a tree view for each profile , drawing an own building site for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub @-@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration , one can turn off event actions and add these actions to change or delete . event actions are executed if a certain event occurs , such as the si@@ ders of a file . see details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project which was opened . this behaviour can not be influence at the moment . &quot;
to open a different project you can open project ... from the menu project or the Symbol project open the tool bar . the dialog box opens and allows the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; if &amp; quant@@ um lus ; closed , the repository will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files . same happens when you upload a new project . &quot;
the project management approach gives free access to the files in the project . there you can manage the files in the current project .
&quot; folder behave as well , however , the entries must open and open it with ... in the right mouse button menu : &quot;
&quot; here , various profiles can be chosen . the profile contains information about the location of uploaded files . see . &quot;
&quot; allows removing the current profile . if only one profile is present , the button is blin@@ ded to prevent removing . &quot;
the password will keep in the kernel and forget by program . this option is useful if frequent up@@ loading files is necessary and the rather uncertain password on the plate can &apos;t be stored on the plate -@@ option .
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog if you change your opinion before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus , many high @-@ loading profiles can be uploaded and thereby uploaded the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when working or creation of a profile , this dialogue is displayed : &quot;
&quot; this is the server name , to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified domain name , or an IP address will work . &quot;
&quot; the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; K@@ DE ; and install the installed Ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( locally ) and NFS . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally this does not have to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your att@@ ach@@ wave this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it stored on the plate , so it cannot be read on the plate , but everyone with programming files can easily be seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set files and tool@@ bars . it can be loaded in a project many views , i.e. by simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; can be stored in the menu , or the Project tool bar , accessible via Settings tool tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; with which one has to do most . this helps not only boost productivity , but also allows adap@@ ting &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; to the own working mode . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; best available via the menu tool@@ bars . use and adding differs . the adding of tool@@ bars will be treated below in the section adding of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be set on either by Con@@ text menu ( right click on the tool bar ) , in which you can remove any tool bar , tool bar ren@@ ame or tool@@ bars , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions on this or other tool@@ bars may be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool bar , additionally the entries will remove and action processed which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and promotions on them can set up in the menu with settings of tool settings ... and setting up actions ..
&quot; templates are linked to the essential document tags , code sni@@ el and files to link . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory with extended organization and interfaces . you can copy , post@@ p@@ one or any of the system existing directory in the storage space . templates are in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions placed on the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified in the beginning of each template .
&quot; binary is everything that is not pure text . it can be inserted any file except text , images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are normally added to document templates ( e.g. pictures with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates . more information about templates &quot;
&quot; documents can be created by any text file type . based on this templates , new documents can be created . normally a simple report for the purpose and organis@@ es work in appropriate templates . some examples can be found in the storage room under global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template , but the same text area will always be inserted into documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ as@@ cript or Perl . some examples are available in the storage room under global templates . see for more information on templates . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are for whole websites as templates . you are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; create a document structure according to you ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file as template , save as local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it was stored as an project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the storage room under project deposits . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and save on file as template , save as local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be drawn from drag and laying on the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only copy in a file folder . you can use all the file management functions for it , such as pulling and laying or insert over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a file tree or in the project files building view to a folder , click on the template and secure a name for the template and secure it . by default , it can be saved as local or global submission . &quot;
project transactions enable a very target group . you can specify head@@ lines and foot@@ er or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; make files insert or link with them . additionally you can keep some things in using templates in projects very profound in mind .
the pre@@ mise structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates and $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / qu@@ anta / templates or templates . each of these folders corresponds to one of four types of containers as above .
&quot; in order to determine the behavior of a folder , in the template &apos;s button with the right mouse button to click on the folder and select the context menu properties . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a select box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is blin@@ ded as soon as the attributes of par@@ ental attributes . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits for everything except the regular folders in the box overview . if a regular folder would be dis@@ able , it would appear templates in this path , except they would be explicitly enabled . if nothing appears , you probably find in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; inspec@@ ted or recre@@ ated text for templates in this folder . this could be general head@@ lines and foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project , enabling copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ er a complete presentation already with the matching head lines / foot@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we have a full command menu ( indicate the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding files or copy and insert templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; quant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; Editor and second edit the editor window in two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : he loads a document as a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; - side and cur@@ sor will be released , then you can edit and when needed to the source code editor , where the corresponding changes are visible in the V@@ PL ; editor in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL , Editor at a document that contains &amp; PHP ; contains , a small green symbol indicates the V@@ oh@@ and@@ en@@ ite of &amp; PHP ; -@@ source code . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; there is no plans to change these behavi@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works exactly as the first , except that simultaneously the changes are visible in the source editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ous is running . using pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ wer has been removed from a window to the others , where the position is retained in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ ization distance between the V@@ PL ; editor and the source code is adjustable via Settings Qu@@ anta .... After choice of V@@ PL ; -@@ view , you can also choose between synchron@@ ization after a click or automatically . in general , the recommendation is : a small spi@@ der for fast calcul@@ ator and a large range for slow PC . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the document of invisible tags in working with the V@@ PL ; Editor is also called , as soon as a new document with the V@@ PL ; editor is also called . this allows to change the reduction of the body . so you can change the following : &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself , e.g. key words for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . a click into the list allows the amendment to the In@@ hal@@ tes , e.g. keywords in the column names and key word Key@@ word 2 on the content column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new path of creation of pages in the browser . you can add CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change about the list is exactly as possible in the met@@ a @-@ elements . the editing of CSS rules is not supported yet .
&quot; it is possible to bind a external CSS style , by pressing on the file button and select the corresponding file . &quot;
&quot; the use of cur@@ sor is as defined in a text word , through due to the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cur@@ sor beha@@ ves like usual . the marking works as usual . text may be inserted by typ@@ ing and delete a button or distances . &quot;
&quot; tags : tags will be made in the same way about the tool@@ bars , as in the source code . it is to be aware that the tags is inserted into existing identical tags if an anchor @-@ day , en@@ cir@@ cled with text , must be removed every other bo@@ unding anchor . &quot;
some tool bars like the tables assistant or the lists assistant are disabled . you will later work in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will need to work on the tables or lists tool@@ bars .
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for testing styles . in contrast to other programs for Stil@@ ts , search for certain elements are possible and the execution of the style can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to get &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ ile , need except &amp; K@@ DE ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ sl@@ t , li@@ be@@ x@@ sl@@ t and lib@@ x@@ ml , which are available at a typical installation of &amp; K@@ DE ; already available . &quot;

x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame without a ple@@ a . fil@@ en@@ ames in the same folder as the top @-@ charged style file names with rel@@ ativ@@ ement path to working file con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g is for example a sty@@ li@@ stic file for working folders .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ sl is possible to enter the following input :
&quot; in this command , it will be checked on a partially or entire match with a pre@@ age called QNAP or a specified module name . proof ; template coinci@@ des with each my@@ ME , which contains the string template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace of the specified &quot; &quot; QNA@@ ME &quot; &quot; will be expanded according to the rules specified by the X@@ SL : test@@ 1 and eg ; extended to htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 199 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
&quot; a decent holding point must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this will automatically be executed when loading of the first template by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g . holding points will be re @-@ checked again shortly after the start of each run . &quot;

several commands require more than an argument . quotes : using the command &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; &quot; as an argument there will be a holding point in a file called &quot; break &amp; quot ; * _ BA@@ R _ @ quot ; . &quot;
template _ NA@@ ME : a valid name of a template that exists only from the ASCII characters 0x@@ 00 to 0x@@ 7@@ F . this name can be a fully qualified name such as &quot; X@@ SL : tem@@ plat@@ e@@ Name . &quot;

there are many graphic tools for the same . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me explain briefly why I wrote .
&quot; the mer@@ ging was very complicated , because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously had changed the objec@@ tion . another programmer had changed much text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts with mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me was only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within that lines . and there were no clu@@ es on the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed . the merge of these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could display differences in line and changes to white characters . later any amount of other useful features were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it into the clip@@ board and add it in one of the compar@@ ative window . &quot;
&quot; a function made a lot of work , was the compar@@ ing and mer@@ ging of folders . this function turned &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost in a full file browser . &quot;
&quot; also , 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful if two people work independently in a piece of co@@ de and make changes . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . in this editor , you can even edit the result directly . this image shows three qu@@ ell files at mer@@ ging : &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the same and mer@@ ging complete folder . this screen photo shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; with the folder @-@ merge :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; shows the precise differences and rep@@ ain@@ ly the capabilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you have to check the code , you will like this feature . &quot;
differences in white signs and tab@@ ul@@ ators are shown clearly . if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no harm changes if there is no problem . )
&quot; when one file is equal , and the other differs in a line , then the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both files are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name , but in different folders , you can simpli@@ fy your work by typ@@ ing only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ use , folder 2 , folder 1 folder 2 @-@ o target bin@@ dings , diff@@ 3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder &quot;
&quot; the opening dialog allows the manual typ@@ ing of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or select a recently opened file from the list of file . if you don &apos;t have to leave the file for C , the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files . &quot;
&quot; via the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be chosen , for B and C , however , a folder , then uses &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ames of A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; when mer@@ ging is crossed , the input field is active and can be processed . however , it is not necessary to determine immediately an output file . you can do this step later when saving . &quot;
the set @-@ up button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before you start with the default / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare all the file , but only parts of a text . &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the clip@@ board . the comparison begins immediately . in the open dialog you don &apos;t need to select files just with the break button . &quot;
&quot; you can also use drag and pick up : drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor , and let it fall on a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; what thought is behind it ? sometimes a file contains for example a number of similar functions . if you want to figure out what these functions are , that would be a relatively large effort . you would have to copy two appropriate files , then compare and compare these functions . now you can simply copy the relevant sections , then compare and then compare . &quot;
note : you can do nothing from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; pull out . only the drop of text in a compar@@ ative window is supported .
warning : some editors may interpre@@ t the pulling and insert text into another program as a trigger and insert ( instead of copying and insert ) . in such case your original data could go lost .
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info line of the source code contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ames and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window is optional . ) Each info line has a while over the line . then , the mouse will display the full name . &quot;
&quot; the three source stops are the letters A , B and C . a has the color blue , B the color Green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these settings can be changed on the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when one difference is recognized , one sees to the color , which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( colour for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is especially useful if you compare three files . that &apos;s in the next section ( merge ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the text is the summary column . when differences were found , the column displays the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( in C / C + + are white characters only in strings and commentary , for the processor and in few , rare cases relevant . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line , which separates the summary column of the text , is interrupted at the places where the source file is not activated . if the line is activated , the line is displayed on broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the results window ( under the comparison list ) also has a info line with the inscription below : , the fil@@ en@@ ames and &#91; changes &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains text , but often it also includes conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts have been dissolved is the Save off ! ! ! ( use the buttons to the next dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference is also a conflict that must be solved manually at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the window frames are selected and the first line of the group is displayed , and the first line of the group is displayed . this group will then emphas@@ ize the current group . it will appear with the color background colour for current range and each left is a black beams . &quot;
&quot; sometimes in these lines of the text and lt ; there is only a plac@@ eholder for the event that you will change your opinion , and maybe choose another source . this text does not appear in the final stored file , nor in a marker you might want to copy and add elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge tracking ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy any kind of text from the result window . go c@@ auti@@ ously with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources of sources , ignore or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments are activated , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; this will navigate mainly with the images and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are in one of the window , you can use the arrow keys left , right , beginning , tr@@ l @-@ start and tr@@ l end , si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the eye window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . with the insert button you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
&quot; a click with the left mouse button , in one of the summary columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows in the beginning of each group ( as already explained in paragraph ) and the editing window . &quot;
&quot; the tool bar contains seven buttons to navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ down / Str@@ g @-@ picture ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ picture ) or to the next / previous conflict . hence , the conflict must be distinguished as conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the markings to the clip@@ board , you &apos;ll need to copy the copy button ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ In@@ sert ) , and if this option is activated , you will automatically copy the clip@@ board automatically . be careful with this option , because you could accid@@ entally over@@ write the content of the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; lines are stored in accordance with the underlying operating system . UNIX and Win32 @-@ based systems use a line @-@ in block \ \ \ \ . K@@ diff@@ 3 ret@@ ains the contents of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; also not using binary files . &quot;
&quot; the options and the list of the most recently used files will be saved automatically , and re@@ produced with the next start . ( menu entry - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 ... ) &quot;
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog can also be used with variable width , but you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; when you activate this option , differences are shown in ital@@ ic font . if the selected text does not support this representation , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; systems with only 16 or 256 colors could not be available in their pure form , but would be to@@ ast@@ ert . on these systems the kno@@ b set automatically an odd color . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , when the tab@@ ulator button inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a tab@@ ulator @-@ character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you enter or return Return , the return line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . the manual copying in the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which Z@@ eil@@ ing type you prefer to save . the default value is the generally usual selection on the used operating system .
&quot; when loaded files tries &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all fully identical lines can be found in the source files . only during this first step , white signs compar@@ es each line . in this step white signs are not ignored . also , white signs are not ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a car line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , others again save a line slot &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a row , but then they could be displayed differently . if this option is enabled , a car down@@ fall is treated differently , but if this option is enabled , this option must be disabled . in default , this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; the default option is disabled . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters are ignored ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; -@@ &apos; ) . in the result the differences are still displayed , but they are treated like white characters . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . changes in comm@@ ent@@ aries are dealt with in white characters . &quot;
inten@@ sively search for smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files but slowly with very large files .
&quot; in automatic jumping mode , this setting defines how long the result of the selection is displayed , before the next un@@ interrupted conflict shall continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically trig@@ gers all conflicts in white characters by selecting the chosen file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) That &apos;s useful if white characters are less important in many files . if you are using it only from time to time , then use better the functions W@@ ähle A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . &quot;
&quot; these options are covered in the chapter on scanning , folders and execute a merge . watch for details below doc@@ s to list comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is stored and already an older version exists , the original version is the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original attached . if already an such backup file with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ original exists , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
fits the language of the user interface . the change of this option does not matter the current program . you need to end &amp; restart the change . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; diff@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is adjusted globally about the control centre . )
&quot; the following code settings can be set separately for each entry . if you use this option , the top setting is used for all entries . &quot;
a short notice about the selection ranges for coding is a short notice of which local coding is . ( this can not be changed here and has a purely inform@@ al character . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . as the coding for each file can be adjusted individually , even files can be compared and merged with different coding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can set here which coding is to be used for storing . &quot;
&quot; if you define the processing command , you may not work with your code@@ c . ( e. g. if your files may be 16 @-@ bit Unicode , but the command command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII ) . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to supp@@ ress the correc@@ tions of changes in the text or over@@ sight . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are ignor@@ ing or Ign@@ ore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are shown in a color coded over@@ si@@ zing column . but sometimes you may only see the differences between two of three files ; -@@ gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ gt ; C will be displayed next to the normal still another excess column column with the necessary information . &quot;
sometimes you prefer to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply select the less important window . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the compar@@ ative window next to each other or to each other . this can also be useful for read@@ ings of long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide to merge the files together . if you are using only two files . a simple click starts the merge and use the fil@@ en@@ ames of the last source file as default for output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge file , then the name of the last actu@@ ated file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . in &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own custom processor , which is exactly how to cut out your own requirements . you can use this feature , for example , dis@@ rup@@ tive parts or correction . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will be handed over to this external command . if also a normal pre @-@ processing command has been given ( see above ) , then the command will be used to input this pre@@ fabri@@ cation command . you can write your own custom processor , which fits exactly your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the Di@@ ff results . however , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program themselves . the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l perfectly sufficient . &quot;
&quot; * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ &quot;
CV@@ S and other vertical control systems use some keywords to insert automatically generated character strings ( info : / c@@ vs / keyword \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experim@@ enting with sed sed , you may start to understand it and perhaps you may like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; ignor@@ ing of numbers is actually a built @-@ in function in K@@ diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of a further pre @-@ processing command for the line compensation . sed it / &#91; 0@@ 123@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; It is a hit , and every hits will be replaced by nothing , so quasi @-@ deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several directions at once . then you can use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; to separate the requirements of each other . example :
&quot; instead , you can also use something different such as per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ G@@ EX@@ P / replacement / switch &apos; However , per@@ l needs some details . where used \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the set &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are maintained for the display and merge . the further operations change only the data that the line @-@ like @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ m sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal Pre@@ processor , the Z@@ eil@@ en@@ ab@@ al Pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal Pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the processor commands are very useful , but as with any function , the text changes or differences , you may not notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
often you need to edit programm@@ ers in a folder many files . for this reason you can compare and merge together with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder .
... make an suggest@@ ion to merge for each object ; you can adjust the proposal before starting
... can sim@@ ulate the merge and shows the sim@@ ulated changes without they really perform .
... &quot; select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is similar to the compar@@ isons and merge of files very similar . you need to open only folder on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are run together , folder will be used as a base . if no target file is given , used &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; folder 3 as target file . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will start automatically , not to merge , select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder you will find a small news window over the current progress . if you cancel the folder , only the files are listed , which are compared until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , features &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with results on the left , ... &quot;
every file and each folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click here .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder , click on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow keys to the left / right . the directory contains two functions of all sub@@ directories and fold out all sub@@ directories with which you can open all folders . &quot;
&quot; when you double click on a file , the file comparison is started and it appears a compar@@ ative window . &quot;
the symbol in the column is reflected the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , this is visible in the columns A / B / C and details pane with the selected object . in such a case the merge action can not be selected automatically . if the merge is started , you will be informed of this type of problems . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the above picture , are used in columns A / B / C the colors red , green , yellow and black . &quot;
&quot; identical to identical entries , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered as the same as all of its contents are identical . then , folders is the same color . with folders , the age is considerably less for its colour . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ diff . colours reflect the colors of a leaf , which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C identical but not B : copying of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C identical but not A : copying of A ( or if A does not exist , del@@ eting the target , if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory dat@@ atyp@@ es . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if a file and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory dat@@ atyp@@ es . as long as such defective objects exist , the merge cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; synchron@@ ize mode is active , if only two folders and no explic@@ it target file have been indicated and if the option directories are synchron@@ ize . then cho@@ oses &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary promotion , so that both folders are identical . if , for one entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for output file only B ; directly after mer@@ ging copy &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders will be merged and select the new file instead of merge ( un@@ safe ) , then exam@@ ining &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ di@@ ces are not eliminated , then the file can &apos;t be started . &quot;
&quot; during the merge , a file is performed after the other . it &apos;s status column indicates that the mer@@ ging was successful , and correspon@@ d@@ ingly other messages when the merge is complete , you should make a final review and see if the status is in order everywhere . &quot;
&quot; if in setting dialog the file compar@@ ative method is selected , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these include the number of un@@ resolved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for deleted conflicts is only displayed if three folders can be compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; either you can merge either the selected entry ( file or or@@ dner ) , or select all entries at once . if you have selected all of the merge actions ( also in all sub @-@ folders ) , you can start mer@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have no destination folder , then in the Three @-@ file association mode C , B is used as a target , using the two @-@ file association , B as target and / or B is used as target . &quot;
&quot; if you select a target file , please check if all entries must be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure . there are some options through certain entries to be ski@@ pped . check these options for un@@ pleasant surprises : &quot;
&quot; to bring together all entries , select directories start / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the key combination ) . to run only the current entry , select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; if due to conflic@@ ting data types , still invali@@ d inter@@ actions exist , a message appears to indicate the in@@ correct elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you bring all entries together , a dialogue window with the options run , sim@@ ulating and break down . &quot;
&quot; choose Sim@@ ulate if you want to see what would happen , without which really changes would be made . you will then receive an exhau@@ st@@ ive list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; diff@@ use 3 ; then execute specific actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( together with a single file ) , then a merge window ( note the screenshot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select re @-@ select directories start / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t stored yet , an appropriate dialog appears . then execute &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work continues with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on an error , you will find a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list , you will see some errors that will help you to select the problem of the problem or solve the problem to solve the problem or solve the problem to other ways before you proceed with the merge . &quot;
&quot; if some entries were individually compiled , check @-@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs it in later together all entries will not be taken together . only if you will merge the merge action , these entries are re@@ group@@ ed again . &quot;
set the Settings menu of &amp; diff@@ use 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory @-@ merge with these options :
only files that match on the specified pattern will be shown in the element tree . split the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . file doesn &apos;t need to match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be done more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that correspond to this pattern are not shown in the element tree . it can be done more than one pattern , use the Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ating characters . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ original ; * .@@ O . &quot;
ignored files that are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mat@@ ically generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this file can be set @-@ specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ signal file . ( look under info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a node attribute . in other file systems you can choose a prec@@ urs@@ .@@ one file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; when links to files : if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to which the links show . this is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched off , the links such as normal folder will be treated and recur@@ sive . ( note that if the option is switched on ) , a link for itself would lead to an end loop and crash@@ es ( diff@@ use 3 ; ) This option is switched off . &quot;
&quot; results in a complete analysis of all file through and shows the statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and considerably slower , if they are applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare big folder over a slow network , it may be possible to compare the change date and the file size . however , this speed benefits does not cost you a certain degree of security . please note with caution . this option is g@@ lowing in default . &quot;
&quot; similar to Confi@@ dence the Change date . there is no real comparison instead . the files are considered identical when copying the change date is lost . please use caution . this option is g@@ lowing in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ating synchron@@ ize mode when two folders are compared and no target file is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for mer@@ ging files are identical . also the results from merge files are stored in both folders . this option is displayed in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merge the copy of the newer file is proposed as action . ( this is assumed as un@@ certainty as it is assumed that the other file doesn &apos;t have changed in any case . ) This option is displayed in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or a file is replaced or deleted by another file , the original version is renamed and receives the extension .@@ original If an old backup file is already deleted . that &apos;s also the normal merge of single files , not only the merge file . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the file association @-@ merge views remain visible ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to turn the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to turn the window in the window menu , turn the main window in the window menu and switching between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to get a file simply by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry for you . once you can save the file , the status will be dealt with and the file will not run again when you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost if you re @-@ read the directory : directory -@@ Menu : re @-@ read &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way , you can specify files and folders that are located on local or remote computers . &quot;
the first line @-@ line compar@@ es a local file with one FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax as local files and folders . a few things you should note :
&quot; a path can be relatively large , or .. contain . that is not possible with UR@@ Ls , these are always absolutely . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be m@@ asked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , neutral - &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes because of the fil@@ esystem to the server , sometimes by using the protocol . it follows a brief list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can &apos;t be distinguished if a link shows a file or a file . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( ft@@ p : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no possibility to edit per@@ missions or change of change of change . therefore refer to the per@@ missions or the change date of the original . ( note the option of confidence of size . ) ( This is only possible in local files . )
&quot; the main purpose of use is currently available as differences @-@ viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op first always starts the built @-@ in difference in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . to start K@@ diff@@ 3 , press the right mouse button over the differences viewer and then choose In K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part show from the context menu . &quot;
normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two complete input files . if it is used as a part , receives &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file names must exist in the Uni@@ fied file format . then start &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the names of the file files from the patch file . then start &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 ; the patch program to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or , you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview into - K@@ reducing 3@@ Part . note that this doesn &apos;t work if there is not any of the original files . also , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part is executed , it only supports the compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool bar and menu . the combination or the compar@@ ing folders will not be supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ diff@@ 2 ( now it is comp@@ uted ) already . furthermore , the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge like the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs very long and have learned a lot by reading other programs in the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all the programm@@ ers who have gone the way or will go so .
&quot; you have compiled the program compiled from the sources and configure the configure script in / us@@ r / local , but then K@@ DE can &apos;t find the resources for the user interfaces ( eg . diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file you will find more information about this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters vary differently , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white sign is different , the line is not covered as not identical . i@@ F ( next lines : next to Each Other , this gl@@ is , but this is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor is indicated for each difference in the files where he starts and where it ends . that &apos;s necessary to solve a conflict easily by clicking on the source code and select the button 2 , but it &apos;s too much effort to design the file format to create this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too large . you can always restore a certain version to select a source A / B / C . to edit the larger amounts of text an other editor should be used .
&quot; after removing the text , no sr@@ c is right ; it appeared and the text does not extingu@@ ish . what does it mean and how can it be removed ? &quot;
&amp; diff@@ use 3 ; already used many colors to emphas@@ ize differences . even more high@@ lighting would be conf@@ using and missed the purpose . please use another editor for that .
many good ideas and error reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.1 or newer .
information as you can use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes will be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og file .
&quot; to comp@@ ile &amp; c@@ diff@@ 3 , on a system with &amp; K@@ DE ; to comp@@ ile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of &amp; co@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir provides the folder in your system , installed in the K@@ DE . if you are un@@ secure , you will find more details in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ate used , you should not have problems with comp@@ iling . should nevertheless difficulties pers@@ ist , please report on the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ mailing lists of it . &quot;
&quot; cut off ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or reverse removal ) into the clip@@ board , adding the text from the clip@@ board to the current cur@@ sor position and replaces the current marker . &quot;
&quot; only differences : files that are identical in all folders are not appear in the folder structure , and thus also not in target file . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you need to re @-@ read about changes to these options with the function Update . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . this also assumes that identical files are not already copied into the target file . if the target folder does not already contain in the target file . ( the behavior is likely changed in a later program version . ) This option is displayed in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose from the source with the inscription A , B and C below the menu bar . if you are on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group at the end of the selected group ( if they are not already present ) , they are displayed next to the button accordingly . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is de@@ activated . understanding in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white signs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a miniature preview of all virtual spaces . it is quite convenient to change the running programs on the work@@ space , to change their size or move it . this works both inside a desktop as well as several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display all virtual environments as well as the existing applications , and applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop . &quot;
&quot; with the medium mouse button , windows can be moved within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible in both a desktop and other work@@ space . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; cli@@ cked , the context menu only has two entries to set up ... and end . if , on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on display the icon and the name of the application , maxim@@ ize , to desktop and loading . the commands have the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of desktop . appears only if cli@@ cked on a application .
the application for the selected virtual desktop . appears only if cli@@ cked on a application .
&quot; this check box can be marked , can window within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; s with the medium mouse button on the desktop and also to other work@@ space . &quot;
if this field is crossed will be displayed in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; the name of the virtual working areas are displayed .
&quot; cross the field lets this field lets you display the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual working areas . it is included with name , the names are provided with ordin@@ ance , &amp; eg ; 1st working area . &quot;
&quot; if this field is crossed , the background every working area is also displayed as a back@@ drop in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the current programs will be displayed as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; indicated otherwise only the empty work@@ space will be displayed in order to make their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the propor@@ tions of the program windows . icon shows a small view of the real program window . remark : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classic leaves &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; it is known as p@@ ager @-@ applications in some other windows , horizont@@ ally and vertically in a vertical series , which is very good for the presentation on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager miniature range in the control panel . it has the advantage that it can display in size as symbols or with their content and move it outside the control panel .
Click the right mouse button within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent fitting of the switch will be connected ... lets the dialog appear .
at the moment it cannot be changed in dialogue settings . but you can manually do it manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have a write permission for the file , you must register as user root or apply to your system administrator . in this file , you need to apply the key win@@ dow@@ transparent mode and make it a value . possible values are : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package k@@ de@@ base , you need a working installation of the K@@ DE floor packages . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mag ; is a screen wi@@ pe . you can enlarge with &amp; k@@ mag ; this application is interesting for different users : this application includes artists , web designer and people with an ey@@ hin@@ ge . this documentation is intended to include a complete manual for the use of &amp; k@@ mag . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly expanding around new features . it is optimised for use on high @-@ performance machines .
&quot; when you can start &amp; like ; start , a window as pictured above . the main window of the screen shows . in the following the enlarged area of the screen is called .. The picture , which is displayed in the enlarged window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as the selection window . &quot;
in the default setting up &amp; k@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a mobile magni@@ fying glass . alternatively you can specify a selected screen area in the enlargement window ( selection mode ) or the surroundings of the mouse poin@@ ter at the screen ( eg ; at the left screen ) .
&quot; do you want to avoid that the mouse poin@@ ter is displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse poin@@ ter . please note that this is not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the standard K@@ DE ; / Q@@ t ; -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the selection mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow and bottom buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following ways : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse poin@@ ter in the enlargement window and hold the left mouse button , so you can move the contents of the enlargement window and move it with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the &amp; SH@@ IFT key ; press the &amp; M@@ MB , you can post@@ p@@ one the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection panel is fixed and just move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; I like ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , copy in a file to insert into the clip@@ board ( to add it later into other applications ) , turn the image and much more . &quot;
&quot; starts and stop the updating of the display . the St@@ alli@@ on of the updating works , that the required CPU time is against 0 . &quot;
&quot; the upgra@@ ding rate ( Very low , small , medium , high , very high ) . the higher the actu@@ alization rate , the more CPU time is required . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a select window will be displayed . the selected area is displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; automatically uses your set @-@ up command to save files , opening a new window , printing , new@@ com@@ ads ( using the button document again invite in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlarge and p@@ etty , etc . &quot;
may also be known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; is a screen wi@@ pe . you can use a screen size . you can use a micro@@ scope to view the small printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of use : from research or artist to web@@ designer or vis@@ ually handic@@ apped .
detailed user documentation can be found with help : / k@@ mag ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; Kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start help@@ center help : / k@@ mag ) .

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , once the mouse poin@@ ter a while on the same spot . it &apos;s meant to help people who want to em@@ ulate the repet@@ itive type In@@ jury ( RS@@ I ) syndrome , and to which every single mouse click pain . however , this requires a little exercise . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can handle the pain that arises during the mouse click . unfortunately , you may cause pain that are related to the mouse without pain . unfortunately , you may seek pain that are related to the use of your computer , if this is not done yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it even clear@@ er : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , which helps to avoid the mouse , it is against pain that are caused by the mouse due to the mouse , us@@ eless . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and leads to a mouse click as soon as you inter@@ rupt the movement shortly .
&quot; intelligent shifting is enabled , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after using the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement , before leaving the mouse button . the intelligent shifting demands a little exercise , but you get used fast . &quot;
this time must be out after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click out .
&quot; if the mouse button is turned on , the pitch is set to move ( 1 / 10 s ) . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after the supp@@ ress of the mouse button , before the mouse button is reset , if the mouse button is broken down . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; now supports the click on the right and back , followed by a break , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow motion is stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt which is first launched , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; if the sound is delayed , you can reduce the response time . open the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose the sound system and here the tab General . there is a sliding @-@ down sound buffer you set to a lower value to reduce the response times . &quot;
&quot; this setting is marked , &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; started at each start &amp; K@@ DE ; this feature is currently only under &amp; K@@ DE ; available at G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments to find out how you start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings on the values that were set when opening the dialog . have you already pressed the button , you will have set the settings on the stand after the last pressures of application . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with pres@@ ets . especially the intelligent shifting should you be switched off first . if you then click on the automatic mouse click , you can add the intelligent shifting later . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; K@@ DE ; for sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of what places a mouse click without effect remains : the click on the neutral components of windows or spots in the browser window that doesn &apos;t show a link , you can &apos;t use the mouse to such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; if your mouse is rest@@ art@@ ed , you should clean your mouse . it is normally quite simple . the trick is in doing so that you do not only cleanse the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you have to take out the mouse ball . as it happens , the mouse is different from mouse to mouse . however , it should be clear if you view the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you should have to see the rolls . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was used . dirt and the so@@ iling can easily be scra@@ ped with a flat blade or the finger nails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system dis@@ closes the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if just a move was started . if you &apos;re going to use the intelligent move , means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation no longer can end by letting the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; using another window manager and move a window .
the solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click here . here the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; reset and you can continue to work as usual .
problem : if you type text is tried &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse cli@@ cks and sets the cur@@ sor to another place .
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cur@@ sor position to place where you want to have it . but then , use the mouse on a neutral area of desktop , if you do not want to push it out . secure zones for the mouse poin@@ ter &amp; eg ; the grey surfaces around the tool@@ bars and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shifting , but I don &apos;t create it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; intelligent shifting is a advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very comfortable to move it into the clip@@ board , and you will probably cause any other action to put it in the clip@@ board . but there will be some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent move , if you are just starting to start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to use text instead : perform the switch press at the end of the text area and hold the switch press at the other end of the text and again the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this means , every time , when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button is pressing a sound like a mouse click . so you can just use the intelligent move without the audi@@ ble mouse click . however , you can also use the intelligent shifting system without the audi@@ ble mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be used , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window ; must be installed . this should be the case in most cases . &quot;
the audi@@ ble mouse cli@@ cks is only available when the system has a sound card and loudspeaker are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter quickly dist@@ orted . this program was designed for people who suffer from the RS@@ I syndrome and to whom the im@@ pose of the im@@ pose pain is prepared .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured , that there is a certain time that a pulling process begins before the mouse button is started . in this way , the pulling and laying with the mouse can be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program with the m@@ ute users can talk their computer for themselves .
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , m@@ ute users can talk to the computer for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the discussion courses , which are to be spoken once again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wi@@ z@@ ard ( left screen photo ) , enter the command which later is used for the language issue of text . further details can be found in the description of setting dialog@@ s . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text @-@ matching speaker . you can often choose text passages , without having to typ@@ ing them . the text passages can be processed naturally . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen photo ) determine the dictionary for the word stat@@ ute . in addition , the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of the individual words . in addition , you can read the words with a Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correct sp@@ ell words are included in the word eph@@ emer@@ al . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clearly evident and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your phr@@ ases ( the lower white field in screen photo ) and a run memory of the already spoken phr@@ ases ( the upper white field in the screen photo ) .
if you like k@@ mouth ; you can enter the sets which you want to hear . every spoken proposition is attached to the default memory . you can select a phr@@ ases that are again spoken again .
&quot; menu entry Settings k@@ mouth , set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , speech output and settings , the page Wor@@ si@@ fication and the page K@@ TT@@ SD . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card speech , enter the command to call the voice of the language . in the select field under the command field , insert the character encoding , with the text to the language generator . &quot;
&amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text . select the check box if the text should be transferred as default to the language generator .
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will continue as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command is based on your language generator . this command can be found in documentation to your language generator . examples for this will be found in App@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; as the first attempt to use the K@@ TT@@ SD card service as the first attempt to add the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD card service . if that &apos;s successful , the further settings will be available on this page . the abbrevi@@ ation of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first select Field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action by selecting a text passage in the menu directory or in the bar for text pass@@ ag@@ gers is triggered . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ on , the chosen passage passage is inserted directly and in addition to the displacement of the input field the selected text passage will initially be entered into the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection panel Sch@@ ding of the edit windows for text passages , you can design@@ ate whether the text pass@@ agen@@ ders should be stored automatically at the closing of the editing terminal . &quot;
&quot; save the book is stored . if you select changes , the text file formats will not be saved . if you don &apos;t select any modifications , select &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask whether the text passages should be saved . &quot;
the side tables contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the word eph@@ emer@@ al . in the main window next to the Command panel shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a select box if this list contains more than a dictionary . in this selection field you can choose the currently used dictionary for the word use .
&quot; using the buttons on the right , you can delete dic@@ tion@@ aries or add to the order of books , or export them into a file . below the list you can adjust the language and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads then the &amp; K@@ DE ; documentation . the frequency of the single words may be determined by paragraph of the individual words . in addition , you can compare the vocabulary of the Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
this option allows you to assemble the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are related to the dic@@ tion@@ aries .
&quot; with this option , you will create a new blank dictionary without entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; new introduced words automatically in the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window to edit text pass@@ ag@@ gers is two @-@ divided . in the upper part , the text boxes are presented as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the passage passage or the associated button . if you have selected a text file name , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; adding actions such as new text passages or books , or delete selected text passages and books , either via the menu bar , in the tool bar , or over a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the sequence of text password holes , or text passages , you can change through the mouse to the new site , or with the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . in case a text panel is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected sections of the memory cache is selected . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the clip@@ board . in case a text panel is selected , this is used , otherwise the selected sections of the cache . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if text is in the command field , it is used to save the selected pro@@ positions of the cache . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , a post@@ b@@ able tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands are displayed by default . the tool bar is arranged by default on the menu bar directly under the menu bar . by mouse click on the shi@@ fted left side and pulling the tool@@ bar to another spot . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , a narrow glue in the lower part of the main window with hin@@ ts about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed if not crossed , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is crossed , a post@@ b@@ able ly@@ rical kit with entries are displayed . by default , the bar is arranged via the editing window directly under the tool@@ bar . by mouse click on the shi@@ fted left side and drag the tool@@ bar to be moved to another spot . &quot;
probably you probably have entered the command for the language issue not properly or not fully entered . open the page General Settings and enter the command for speech output on the card speech output . ( see Settings dialog for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers to further details . )
&quot; festival is a language edition of Edinburgh University . currently , only English , Spanish and W@@ alis@@ isch are supported . license allows to use the festival free of charge and spread with no restrictions . &quot;
&quot; in order to show an example of command line for the setting of speech output , it is assumed that the festival is installed in the / us@@ r / local / festival . the command to voice output is then : &quot;
Free@@ T@@ TS is a written language generator . currently he only supports the English pron@@ unci@@ ation . it is currently allowed to use Free@@ T@@ TS free to use and spread without restrictions .
&quot; in order to show an example for the command line for the installation of speech output , Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / us@@ r / local / fre@@ iter file . the language edition is then possible with one of the three following command samples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default settings . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of phon@@ em@@ at@@ ry to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows you to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free commercial and non @-@ military applications .
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text in phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA in / us@@ r / local / ph@@ fax and / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la are installed . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax would like to swal@@ low the last character of the text so that an additional character is required . the complete command is therefore more elabor@@ ate than in the other examples : &quot;
( CAT - ; echo ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ BA@@ R _ / us@@ r / local / m@@ bro@@ la / m@@ ole / m@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; d@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wav
all parts of the command must be written in a row . sending data as default settings must be switched on .
the voice @-@ issue dem@@ on of &amp; K@@ DE ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ continue language service provided to all &amp; K@@ DE ; - uses a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different language output systems .
&quot; since the input of the language system only takes place in K@@ TT@@ SD , you just need to use as a language service as voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; for setting the K@@ TT@@ SD card service , which appears in the dialog box of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully use one language generator ( and of course &amp; K@@ DE ; 3.x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires approximately 15 MB memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and configuration . &quot;

before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; you &apos;ll need to install and properly set the program vi@@ disp@@ at@@ cher . see also
&quot; when the first start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr or as long as no speaker are furnished , the card speaker is displayed . see also . if you have set up at least one speaker , the card card will be displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most of the T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer offer various languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set several variants for a syn@@ thesizer . you should use at least a speaker , before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; use the speed speed disp@@ at@@ cher otherwise used the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are comparable with several pres@@ sur@@ ing products for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on board map speakers in kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr , the card speaker is displayed . this also appears automatically when you launch a kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr and yet another speaker is set up . &quot;
all narr@@ ator already appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear in the list . the top speaker is used for the speech output if an application has no speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a row further down . the sequence of speaker in the list is also given their priority . &quot;
Click on one of these buttons to turn your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; system .
&quot; select a tuning type here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a jun@@ gen@@ - and girl &apos;s girls to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new spokes@@ man is posted on the card speaker . to change the settings of this talk , click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card @-@ card and check whether the T@@ TS @-@ Service of &amp; K@@ DE ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to read text orders to create and manage text orders . see . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up at least one speaker , you can open the language output system from &amp; K@@ DE ; click on the box map of General to open this card card . here you can adjust some general options . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box in order to activate the &amp; kt@@ ops ; this starts to activate the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) , and you can use text entries to make text entries . see . remove the marker , will hold K@@ TT@@ SD and make the T@@ TS system of &amp; K@@ DE ; disabled . &quot;
if test is finished ; runs &amp; kt@@ ts ; continue to activate the field output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) if the field output is crossed ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) .
&quot; this check box is marked , and t@@ t@@ sm@@ gr appears automatically in the system range of the control panel , it dis@@ appears once again when the read is finished . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series , you can start text orders , stop and hold back . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can read the latest text in the &amp; K@@ DE ; clip@@ board or a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; Click on users or OK , then all changed settings are taken on all sides . &quot;
&quot; the card orders will only be displayed if K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click on the cart@@ el box in general and enable voice output to be checked out there ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; K@@ DE ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if you want to read and select in the main menu tools . after a short time , the language output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always sensible to mark the desired text of a web page . you can ski@@ p this step also , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre@@ st@@ resses and other invisible brands are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Kate ; the extended text editor of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can read displayed text , check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs first . mark the text that will read and select in the main menu tools to read text . then , the language edition should start . &quot;
this also works if &amp; Kate ; embedded in other applications such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; qu@@ anta ; .
K@@ emer@@ ovo is the message system of &amp; K@@ DE ; you will notify you about your fixed events . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts .
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; the IR@@ C program of &amp; K@@ DE ; you can set up various kinds of messages , for example , that you can notify me if in a IR@@ C @-@ channel a message appears when your Nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can then read the IR@@ C message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; K@@ DE ; programme K@@ emer@@ gen@@ us , appears a menu entry noti@@ fications in the menu settings of this program . the possible settings for K@@ emer@@ gen@@ cies vary depending on application . &quot;
&quot; it is a good example . it is a good example . it is a good example . it is a good example . it is a good example . it removes the Tags b@@ r and b from the messages that sent the mail , and in addition to the expression / local / In@@ box , as it can be assumed in most cases as provided . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ops ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ops ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text will be processed before it is sent to the program radio disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unci@@ ation , to select a proper language and speaker , or to handle certain defects of language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the mode of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distingu@@ ishes four kinds of texts . &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Re@@ aders has the highest priority . it will be re@@ signed to all other orders . if the edition of the screen reader is read , the received orders will be continued . &quot;
war@@ nings have the next priority . this stage is important news as &amp; eg ; processor is w@@ alled to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the issue of the warning .
News have the next thing priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; mouth ; is an example of application which can read messages . while you &amp; eg ; a long text on a web site can be read with &amp; k@@ mouth ; meet someone who just enter the room . &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Not@@ ations are also news .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order that you start from the card &apos;s card is a text order . KS@@ ay@@ it is an example of applications , the text messages are used . text orders are thought for the issue longer texts that have no special pressures . &quot;
&quot; all four order books will be operated in waiting @-@ long , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a screen re@@ aders , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a reads , this edition will be stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first you need to know that filter never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal war@@ nings , messages , and text orders , as well as on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News . &quot;
&quot; filter edit the text , and give it to the next filter . currently , there are three types of filters . &quot;
filters are executed as modules . in the future it can provide further types of filters .
&quot; replace the string ch@@ ained parts of a text by other text . the replacement parts may be delivered to either as words or as regular expressions . will be supplied with pre @-@ defined strings such as : - ) through text or for the re@@ format of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understand@@ able form . &quot;
&amp; XML ; trans@@ duc@@ ers use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert and XML ; in delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; are included some X@@ SL@@ T files to the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with spre@@ aders you can send orders depending on the content of the text or on the program that send the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you send a female voice for example on the card speaker , you can read text by K@@ DE messages about this . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters is adjustable , according to which he is used for a language issue . if the filter is established that his rules does not apply , he will remain unchanged at the next filter . &quot;
&quot; if a text order , a message , warning or one &amp; K@@ DE ; notification sent to &amp; kt@@ ts ; it will be processed by all activated filters , which are processed on the page below . in order to edit the filter in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of relevant normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filter will be removed from the range upwards , down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; Click here to insert a new filter . select the type of fil@@ let , and the below are shown below . &quot;
&quot; enter a list of words or regular expressions can be found in a list of words or regular expressions . these patterns are replaced in the text , then the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small @-@ shot will not be regarded as comparison . &quot;
&quot; for your filter , enter a name for your filter . you can choose any name , it must only differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter is compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces him in accordance with the string from the column lists . the list is written in the displayed order from top to bottom .
Click here to move the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons you can download a list of words or regular expressions of a file , save the current list , or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language registered here , the filter is only applied if the speaker for the text order is one of the registered languages . Click on the button to display a list of languages if you can press the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l ; press . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is only applied if the text comes from one of the specified applications . for example , you can enter several programs separately by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; you can use the q@@ d@@ bus program with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers need you to leave . if , for example &amp; q@@ d@@ bus , you can only copy the use ID copy @-@ 34@@ 32 . &quot;
&quot; the string bag filter is only applied to the text if all conditions with one entry in the box Di@@ room filter apply if necessary . are all input fields empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison of words , the string bag filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s word \ \ s word ( spaces must be limited on both sides ) . &quot;
in this manual you will find no instructions on writing from regular expressions . if you have installed the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in am@@ big@@ ti@@ ls .

X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such re@@ formation . however , the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , also x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is enough . &quot;
&quot; with the direct dial filter you can send texts to a certain speaker , which is set up on the card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can define that texts by k@@ mail should read from a female voice . see . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text to the filters , it is looking for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected using the speaker properties that the program speci@@ fies the text on &amp; kt@@ ts . with the letter @-@ out filter , you can write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; here a value is entered , the filter is applied if the text contains the given regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can get this one click on the button to get help . &quot;

&quot; the language issue API , by &amp; K@@ DE ; , with the programmer can give their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD via &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with language syn@@ thesizer to K@@ TT@@ SD are added , so &amp; kt@@ ts ; these syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers can be used . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the language issue API by &amp; K@@ DE ; you can find the full documentation on the K@@ DE ; Acc@@ essi@@ bility website ( htt@@ p : / / accessi@@ bil@@ it@@ y.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications for voice output via the &amp; D@@ bus ; -@@ Interface by &amp; K@@ DE ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d about the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of text to read and option is a language code such as &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands :
&quot; open two &amp; Con@@ sole ; -@@ window . first start t@@ ame in a window , then kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language syn@@ thesizer supports my language . where can I get a syn@@ thesizer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; res@@ orted filter , but using the module &apos;s module are not read on web pages . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone , so that S@@ able is not working at all . you must also do that if you do not need this voice to read by web pages . also ensure that the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is installed and can be found via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters seem to cause mistakes in syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers so that all sentences are ski@@ pped or just as a Kau@@ b @-@ cat@@ ches . what can I do against it ?
&quot; first of all , make sure the option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , these may possibly be fixed by a string @-@ chain filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the language syn@@ thesizer , used by &amp; kt@@ ops ; have their own license you will find in the appropriate documentation or on the relevant web pages . there are also voices that have own license . &quot;
if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive you can download the package k@@ de@@ gl@@ an &amp; kt@@ ts ; you can download the source code from cra@@ ft@@ p below ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / K@@ DE / .

KT@@ TS works with any language syn@@ thesizer which can be launched at the command line in one &amp; con@@ sole .
&quot; the list of the above @-@ mentioned languages can be incomplete or dated . therefore , consider the description of syn@@ thesizer to the supported languages . see also on the website of kt@@ ops ; , according to information that are not included in this manual . &quot;
the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; uses an custom@@ iz@@ able module architecture for language syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for use of any other syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers , put yourself in conjunction with the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter is not mandatory , but Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c with the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to comp@@ ile and comp@@ ile ; to comp@@ ile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) including the Pack@@ deli@@ bs and the Develop@@ er files for the program &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you refer to the source codes of &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source archive for k@@ de@@ mine , or download every night currently , tar@@ ball downloaded , translate , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check first , if you use the device disp@@ at@@ cher with your language syn@@ thesizer . in addition , you can use the Sh@@ ell@@ script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ops ; that is how the program radio disp@@ at@@ cher is used . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr will be so developed that the device of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed .
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into single sets . the user can go down or reset , repeat the output or break down the output . &quot;
&quot; if you use text on &amp; kt@@ ops ; for example , you can claim the properties of the preferred microphone for the issue . if you choose a speaker , whose language English and its gender is feminine , this will be automatically the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker is chosen , you &apos;ll see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the card speaker to add , and then click a speaker to the list or click on Edit , the card speaker card will be displayed . as an example , the module card speaker is displayed . for example , the module will be available for the modules below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path comes to Festival in P@@ AT@@ H , you just need to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text which will be handed over to the festival . in general , this setting will be performed automatically . generally speaking , Western languages are used ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ders , adjust the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you don &apos;t select some regulator and you can &apos;t see this grey voice , the chosen voice can &apos;t be selected . &quot;
&quot; some votes like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices need to be charged for multiple seconds due to their size . if you want to mark this check box , these voices will already be syn@@ thes@@ ized in the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( greater memory consumption ) is the first set to be syn@@ thes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have no speaker furnished ( or forget to click ) . &quot;
&quot; this check box is marked at the start of kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr . otherwise , after the start only the symbol kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be seen in the system section , but not the program window . Click on the icon in the system section to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; this check box is labeled and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr is not running yet , it appears in the system area when K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . thus , you have the possibility to read or control otherwise . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in waiting @-@ long performed , along with the application that has set the contract , the current status of the order , the number of sets and the just worked set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID card ID on the card user . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can select a full step in the order that is selected in the list below , or return . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with a click on OK , all changes in settings ( also on the other cards ) will be taken and kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr will be reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts is not installed , but instead of AL@@ SA , G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text entries are listed and managed . editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ aders , war@@ nings and messages are not shown . for more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can &apos;t be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module comp@@ ile or ct@@ ts ; can not load the necessary libraries . &quot;
&quot; if G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de for the audio output is to be used , select the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must select at least one module . if you select AL@@ SA , select the PCM device here . &quot;
&quot; ask the speech speed here . 50@@ n@@ bsp ; % corresponds to approximately half and 200@@ n@@ bsp ; % about double normal speed speed . therefore , the SO@@ X program must be installed . &quot;
Click on App@@ ly to adopt the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ops ; -@@ system .
&quot; the list of AL@@ SA equipment includes all PCM devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll need to figure out what device works with you . in doubt , select standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card card , you can set particular promotions that will always be executed if the text order from a message with a higher priority is interrupted . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four kinds of language contracts : &quot;
&quot; the edition of Screen Re@@ action has the highest priority . it will be re@@ signed to all other orders . after the edition of the Screen reader has been read , the received orders will be resum@@ ed . &quot;
war@@ nings will be a third priority . this stage is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved to hot . a warning stops the output of messages and normal text . these orders will be continued after the warning of the warning .
News have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example for an application that speaks news . if you can read &amp; eg ; just a long text on a website you can welcome to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome who is just entering the room .
&quot; a text order through a message , warning or the output of a screen re@@ aders are interrupted , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output into the qu@@ eue long . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played when a normal text order is interrupted . if both introduc@@ tory sound is active , the introduc@@ tory sound is played before the introduc@@ tory news . &quot;
&quot; settings on this card card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , war@@ nings and the editions of Screen @-@ Re@@ a@@ dern are there any special actions to be interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ emergency news can be read and click noti@@ fications . the card notification is published .
&quot; mark this check box in order to read the pre@@ reading of &amp; K@@ DE ; if this attitude is not highlighted , the remaining settings are de@@ activated and &amp; kt@@ ops ; reads no noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; this attitude will be marked , noti@@ fications in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ops ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to the list , or delete it . if you click on the button , appears a dialog where you can add the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that reads &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; if someone menti@@ ons your nickname in a IR@@ C message .
&quot; all events , for which in the list is nothing different , are supported by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this select box to determine what is happening ; do , if an event happens . you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you select customized text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholder : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the requested speaker . default cho@@ oses the speaker that will be shown in the list on the card speaker as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if a certain event is defined for a specific application , this action will be executed . otherwise , the action will be implemented for all other events of the specific application . the last possibility comes to carrying the action under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events can not be deleted from the list . for this , you can define the noti@@ fying noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the button Save to save the settings for noti@@ fications into a file . use the button shop to upload stored settings from a file . if you want to begin with an empty list , click on delete . all entries except all respects will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for a speech output . this standard contains brands for the control of voices , speech speed , volume , the generation of voice and pitch . also brands for the control of the pron@@ unci@@ ation . SS@@ ML is a part of the Vo@@ ice@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in the basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you need to install the R@@ ab _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) as this is the default voice , the festival was used in the SS@@ ML edition . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ n@@ bsp ; % , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ positi@@ onal recognition filter ( SD@@ B filter ) . S@@ B@@ Ds must first start @-@ out text in single sets . this allows you to jump or reset , not the whole text order , even if the language syn@@ thesizer do not support it directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ positi@@ onal detection system . when the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts is automatically set up . you can change its settings or add other pro@@ positi@@ onal detection filter , but beginners will be de@@ bur@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; easiest way to read the speech selection menu selection and give text to the reading selection . check out the speech selection , select some properties and check out how the selection of talk is changed . you must , of course , have to set up more than a speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then faster with the reading can begin , since only the first set can be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
&quot; if you are able to register or cancel text orders on the card card , even if the language syn@@ thesizer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal sat@@ in recognition filter will be automatically set up when you start af@@ t@@ sm@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , you can &apos;t change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
&quot; the evidence ( Dec@@ imal code 8 ) compare the text with a regular expression of pro@@ positi@@ onal and add a table of tab@@ s ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the proposition ( devi@@ ations are removed from the text ) , and note that the standard set @-@ to @-@ know filter can be added . &quot;
&quot; S@@ BD filters will never be applied on &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ News ( k@@ Byte ) , war@@ nings , messages , or the output of screen reproduction . &quot;
&quot; if you are removed from leaving the normal sat@@ in recognition filter , you can enter this back by inviting them into &amp; kt@@ ts ; contained in the Standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card menu selection , you can write the advice settings for the application . the card card is displayed if desired . &quot;
use of the standard speakers ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no inter@@ viewer characteristics are specified .
&quot; use of the appropriate speaker , which shows all properties of a registered speaker . if you don &apos;t edit or edit the speaker settings ; otherwise , cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts . otherwise cho@@ oses &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker , the most originally introduced properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired phone properties by clicking on one of the select buttons .
&quot; choose the properties of the requested speaker . if this feature doesn &apos;t matter , enter nothing . &quot;
mark this check box when the property is to have other features . you can set up several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in the understanding of the output , these feature will always be treated as a priority feature . you &apos;ll probably want to use this feature . the only case you may be able to set the attribute language in another language as the specified in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the field of speaker , use at the most likely to clear , click on the select button standard and then use speaker , which is equal to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 stands for the last word order in qu@@ eue . you can also specify an order number . ( without order number , the input is 0 required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr crash@@ es immediately when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ ug support , but I don &apos;t get any tra@@ ce@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ stre@@ amer is crashed and &amp; kt@@ ts . it is probably still to register . at G@@ stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.8 . if the problem is not solved , it may be a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio edition of AL@@ SA will not work when I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message that says : &quot; &quot; to open PCM . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is a problem that conflict with AL@@ SA , which will prevent the same period of several PCM devices . information for possible solutions can be found at the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org . &quot;
I have invited an additional voice for the Internet . I have installed it and can &apos;t use them in the festival but kt@@ t@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / festiv@@ al@@ int / Vo@@ ices the new voice . as guidance , please send a patch together with the &amp; URL ; to which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the card audio , there is a setting speed . that &apos;s how it works , the program SO@@ X must be installed and en@@ ce@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ thes@@ i@@ zer@@ os such as festival Interactive offers a setting for speed . depending on the chosen voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed will be ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ read . ( this is aware that the HTML will be transformed into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for the conversion of &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or if you are completely brave , change the .x@@ sl file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML loop filter , and put the speech speed up . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t manage it to read websites with a female voice . I created a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . this festival does not cause the X@@ SL file to convert SS@@ ML file to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . same goes for VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a search engine filtering filter and now I can do in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ in @-@ up or go back . on the ant@@ it@@ re@@ iter jobs will appear only out of a proposition . what am I doing wrong ?
&quot; you are not allowed to filter inter@@ pun@@ ctu@@ ation signs ( point , question mark , ID and Sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) instead . use a filter for the detection detection for this sign instead . &quot;
Al@@ sa ( Advanced &amp; Linux ; Sound Architecture ) . Al@@ sa is on most systems with &amp; Linux ; already installed . ( www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ projec@@ t@@ .org )
&quot; note : if you are registered in version 0.@@ 8.7 or later , please note that the modules for G@@ Stre@@ amer are registered , by calling G@@ ST regi@@ sters in front of the use of G@@ ST regi@@ sters . ( HTTP : / / g@@ stre@@ amer@@ .@@ fre@@ ed@@ es@@ op@@ .org ) &quot;
&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflict at the audio issue . if your system also counts , you cannot play music at the same time and then start a text . if you will find a text order and then start a further . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; in July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de still does not support real breaks . if you make a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence will still be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program SO@@ X is used for the general setting of speaking speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install SO@@ X with the apt @-@ get install SO@@ X with the command apt @-@ get install SO@@ X . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs are already included . &quot;
&quot; have you downloaded &amp; kt@@ ts ; as a tar@@ ball ( with tar packed archive ) , sign up as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a matching folder . change in this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; K@@ DE ; 4 the module &amp; arts is made ; probably removed or at least still on request .
&quot; the following modules for voice syn@@ thes@@ iz@@ ers are made by default . some of them have a running time @-@ free software . ( not @-@ free according to Deb@@ ian @-@ Distribution ) . configure the configure option to configure the configure parameter , which causes the passing of creation . &quot;
&quot; default is installed as default ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 , this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you need to specify an option --@@ pre@@ fix = target . &quot;

&quot; before you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first , check first if your language syn@@ thesizer works correctly . follow the instructions you get with syn@@ thesizer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS syn@@ thesizer , whose source code is obvious . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices you can adjust volume , talk and pitch with &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help you find in the instructions that are delivered with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice R@@ ab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you have to comp@@ ile an additional module , so you need the source code from the festival . German voices are subject to limitations . &quot;
this voice places festival 1.@@ 95 beta or new ahead . the voice is still in an early development stage . un@@ pack the software at the / li@@ b / Vo@@ ices / russian . if you enter the Russian voices you need to set for the voices ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a k@@ yr@@ illi@@ c ( 8 bit ) coding as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; Festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions , search for the first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
if you want to use the Russian voice the encoding must be set to an 8 @-@ bit C@@ yr@@ illi@@ c as for example KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R .
&quot; Festival can be used together with the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; Syn@@ thesizer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ik@@ y analysis and &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; it produces the audio output . the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices and the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; a complete language version system is . &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; generated language from di@@ phon files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . Festival produces this by &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; needed di@@ phon@@ e. t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce i@@ phone from German lyrics . more information can be found below .
&quot; in this process , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to the festival to use &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ voices to voice syn@@ thes@@ ise . note that the &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; file extensions are not installed in &amp; m@@ bro@@ la ; -@@ folder , but in the folder / li@@ b / . instructions &quot;

&quot; please find your instructions in the RE@@ A@@ DM@@ E file , which you have downloaded .

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows the management of network interfaces , ro@@ uting and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be accessed by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way , as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; to facilitate users a simple interface for the following tasks : &quot;
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center is displayed . the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be launched by selecting : Internet &amp; Network Network Settings in &amp; the menu . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers have already been able to install and configured , so &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device ever indicates and setting the network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers are used for network hardware and other devices at the install of &amp; Linux ; with installed and set up . network units later added , the drivers have to be loaded with adjust@@ ing the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the module settings will be loaded when the network settings can be selected in &amp; c@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; index is selected . when starting the module network settings , this is automatically attempted to detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the full range is offered . it is the platform coming from the list being hit the distribution and the release date . in the next start of the network settings , this selection will automatically be pre@@ set automatically . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings are only possible in the system management mode . before , all options are illustrated , which means settings can only be viewed , which means change is not possible . in the system management mode , click the right bottom end of the module . it is necessary to enter the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the overall functionality of the module is available . these are divided into three rider : &quot;
&quot; the tab interface interfaces for the management of the system . all available network devices are displayed , and all available network interfaces can be performed on the following tasks : &quot;
customized network interfaces can be set by selecting the desired device in the list and click on the button and click on the dialog box .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button Advanced Settings displays the dialogue with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the selection automatic TCP / IP settings are made using a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings will be done simultaneously with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information on any system start . in the selection list either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , according to the system , will be selected . &quot;
&quot; using the manual , without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP , the TCP / IP address can be done . in the input field IP address , the use network is required . &quot;
&quot; this attitude will be marked , initi@@ alized the system interface for bo@@ oting . if the initi@@ alization is not requested , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values in this dialog are displayed as Properties of the device in the device box .
it should be ensured that the IP address is not used in the network . entering a already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole . you can find if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off on , depending on demand . switching from a switched network device is done by selecting from the list and click interface . &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched off on , depending on demand . turn off a activated network device is accessed by selecting from the list and click interface . &quot;
&quot; the host address of the host in the local sub@@ net , which gives the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is connected more than a network interface , the interface must be selected in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support is replacing a full domain name by the appropriate IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the computer is called IP addresses . if the machine htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS resol@@ ves this name to an IP address , such as 12@@ 3.4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the calcul@@ ator for the name resolution part of the e@@ quest@@ ers name solution enables simple management of this list . entries can be added , removed or modify . DNS entries can be changed by selecting a contract , or down@@ gra@@ dation in the list with the buttons . &quot;
by clicking the button to add ... from the group calcul@@ ator to the name resolution a DNS @-@ server can be added . it will add the dialog New Nam@@ es@@ er@@ ver .
&quot; first , you need to enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the button to click on . the entry is inserted in the list . &quot;
from the group machine to choose the name resolution you choose one entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog .
&quot; the list of nam@@ eless hosts describes the name @-@ to @-@ IP address settings for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is used primarily in bo@@ oting , if no DNS servers are available . in small , enclosed network , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains well @-@ known calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IPv6 addresses are supported . this still version of IP will still be replaced in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP address of the well @-@ known host and click Add .... Add dialog New also will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the well @-@ known host and click the button to click . if the well @-@ known calcul@@ ator has several alias name , button Add several times and enter the other alias name . &quot;
select one entry of a well @-@ known host from the list and select Edit .... the dialog box edit is displayed .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking OK the list of static hosts will be updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings used in the module settings are not effective immediately . to enable the changes , it must be set in one &amp; sole . the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net by which you can download the latest version of the source texts .
for installing the binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) it is enough if &amp; K@@ DE ; and Q@@ t installed .
the installation of the ready compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download and install the rpm package as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface can be used as a package or the installation tool of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; in this case , the installation of Q@@ t and K@@ DE is sufficient ; not , but in addition , development packages with libraries and others are required . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended users . however , it is not difficult to comp@@ ile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; to comp@@ ile the following commands . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on fundamental network technologies are given , in the second all by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; change configuration files are discussed . &quot;
&quot; this area may not replace any further knowledge via IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC is convey@@ ed into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IPv4 ) , and 5 has never found great dis@@ sem@@ ination . from IPv6 it is expected to move into the near future . this description is currently concentr@@ ating on the widespread IPv4 . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge to as@@ sign the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; workplace is the point of contact , which can be used a valid IP address . in any case , the IP address can &apos;t be selected . &quot;
&quot; when replacing an own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen from a specially reserved area to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not for@@ warded to the Internet , hence their use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , mostly addresses are used in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 254 . the area is large enough for networks to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the net@@ mask is usually set to 255.@@ 255.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so all the machine participants are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = its own machine ) . the standard route is needed for IP res@@ etting . &quot;
the network address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is assigned to a so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface that works like a closed circle .
&quot; in this part , the configuration files located by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions . &quot;
&quot; this file will sometimes change with DSL connections , so it will not be surprised if there is no content in the case of active DSL connections to find another content . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by using the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand can therefore occur as expected . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a safety program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to create several archives on a tape . the first goal was to create a surface for tar . the second purpose was the answer of a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you sec@@ ures ? &quot;
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be integrated by &amp; co@@ dat ; it can happen to three types : &quot;
&amp; dat ; spin the band back and reads the pre@@ ten@@ sion@@ ing information of the tape . recognise &amp; dat ; the sp@@ ell out of the band will not be asked if the band should be form@@ at@@ ted .
&quot; recogni@@ zes &amp; dat ; the Pre@@ sp@@ ell , searching for the appropriate index on your plate . can this not be found , you will be asked if the band index should be newly created . &quot;
&quot; everything went smoothly , the icon changes the tape drive to indicate that the band has been integrated . in the status bar a corresponding message appears . the content of the tape can now be searched for the band . &quot;
&quot; before dis@@ closure of the tape , first of all , the integration needs to be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; published by a change of symbol for the band , that the connection for the band has been solved and will show a corresponding message in the status bar . the band can now be kicked off without any risk . &quot;
&quot; before a volume of &amp; dat ; can be used , it must be form@@ at@@ ted by &amp; co@@ dat . &quot;
&quot; a band@@ age must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can use to store data . this process does not conform to the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . if your belt drive must be form@@ at@@ ted before using the volume of &amp; k@@ dat ; it is usually a form@@ att@@ ing of the band ahead , DA@@ T drives are usually not to be form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; after entering the belt called and the capacity , &amp; dat ; with the form@@ att@@ ing of the tape . all the data on the tape are lost ! after finishing the form@@ att@@ ing process the band will be integrated automatically and is ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you must select the matching files . that can happen to three types : &quot;
select a file or a folder in the local file tree . it is saved only this file or the folder .
mark a profile profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
mark files in a local file tree with a co@@ oks . only the marked files and / or sub @-@ folders are secured .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and pick you up in the Si@@ f menu ...
&quot; once the backup was initiated , the dialogue settings for backup . in this dialog you can check out the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , dialogue backup appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; mark a file or file in one of the files in one of the files for the drive . it is checked , only the selected file or the folder . &quot;
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a Hä@@ k@@ chen . only the selected files and / or sub @-@ folders are checked .
please click on the right mouse button in one of the archives and choose the menu entry ...
&quot; once the testing process started , the dialog settings for check . in this dialogue you can check out your selection and modify the working folder for checking . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check out dialog . this dialogue shows the progress of the testing process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can recon@@ struct the re@@ building , the files , which are to be restored , must be marked . this can be done on two types : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive , only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
specify the required files from one of the archives with one her@@ kins . only the marked files and / or sub @-@ folders will be restored .
&quot; right @-@ click , click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the menu .... &quot;
&quot; once the recovery process started , the dialogue settings will be rest@@ oring . in this dialogue , you can check your selection and modify the working folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; when you confirmed the settings for rest@@ oring , dialogue will appear . this dialogue shows the progress of the recovery process , and the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to create the band@@ inde@@ x@@ file using the tape @-@ content . this process del@@ etes the existing index files for this band . you can create the index to two types of the band :
&quot; here , a profile profile with the currently selected files and the default settings are created . you can make the following settings for the profile : &quot;
&quot; the current working file , in which the backup should be carried out . the list of the files to secured files is automatically updated according to the selected work folder . &quot;
&quot; for all folders that are listed under backup files , only the files are stored on the same file system , as the folder . file that can be found on other file systems , can be used separately under backup files . each record is considered by tar independently from the others . &quot;
&quot; perform an incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last in@@ correct backup file , a snap@@ shot file is used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
&quot; the name of the file , which is used to determine the changes since the last in@@ sist@@ ent backup . &quot;
del@@ etes the snap@@ shot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be secured and a new snap@@ shot file for the next f@@ use is created .
functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; and lt ; LT ; files was not completely implemented at the time of the creation of this documentation .
the settings can set you up on the menu option K@@ D@@ at ... in the menu settings . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to device file for tape drive ( usually / dev / T@@ ape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ winding variant of the tape device .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; co@@ dat ; before the band is integrated , the command will load on the drive . in some drives this is necessary before reading or write operations . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the option tries to lock up &amp; dat ; it may not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the connection of the integration of &amp; k@@ dat ; automatically cast the band off . don &apos;t use this option on Flo@@ ppy streaming . &quot;
&quot; the option is switched on , tries &amp; k@@ dat ; the hard@@ ship log @-@ size for tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you have to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only show a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file is composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; ( n Byte ) The band ID . the format of this character is the host : seconds , where the name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number second , which has passed since the era , when the band was form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file containing the same name in the folder $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat .
the remaining files on the band are pure tar @-@ archives that can be administ@@ rated directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar can run directly . even other tar versions should work as long as it does not deal with in@@ correct f@@ uses .
check the contents of a backup cover . this icon is only active if a band is integrated .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; is a &amp; K@@ DE ; viewers for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can get information about your system or where the system allows information on your system or where the system enables quick access to information on problems that occur on their server .
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; helps users understand what your calcul@@ ator makes in the background . the task is capable of in@@ experienced users who can not know where you can get information about your system or where the system is deposited on the various protocol files .
&quot; in addition , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; offers users the quick access to information on problems that appear on their server . &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; therefore tries to provide some enhanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by using the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other features are also included in addition and are discussed in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen photo , &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; functions are provided , with their assistance the individual protocol lines can easily filter and sort of . the individual possibilities for sorting and filters are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start , the system tries to open &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - to open it . if you are not displayed , it will be a small news window , so you &apos;ll find &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; very likely not have system down@@ right . the protocol files will usually do not have access to reading . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar , in order to filter a selected crit@@ eri@@ on or according to the specified string . in the default setting , the selection panel is displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is contained . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can also select another entry in this place . the string method is then selected only with entries in the accordingly selected column . for example in the filter bar the name of a process then show you &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; all protocol lines are sent out , which were sent out of this process . &quot;
this option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking color as protocol @-@ lines of level note . the color representation of protocol @-@ lines can be switched @-@ in dialog .
&quot; do you only want to display certain process ( for example in system log or cr@@ on protocol ) , so you can check the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in the column process . this can be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command , such as the start of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to enable new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new release lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; enables the display of several protocol files in separate lower windows . to open this function , use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the menu window to display an additional sub@@ window . once you have selected a window , select an ad in the menu . &quot;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; has a website on htt@@ p : / / ks@@ ystem@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. please find more recent information about the source of &amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ;
&amp; ks@@ ystem@@ log ; also available in the following folder of the &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Subversion archive : ks@@ ystem@@ log ; in &amp; K@@ DE ; -@@ Archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; K@@ DE ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the system V In@@ it develops quickly to the standard for control of the program starts in the &amp; Linux ; world . therefore , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and even more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ In@@ it . &quot;
I &apos;m not going to go further on historical aspects ( i.e. because I don &apos;t know about it : - ) .
&quot; the In@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because someone might try to make a machine on system V In@@ it , without a re@@ installation and re@@ format . therefore , you need to ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there if there was there . &quot;
SY@@ S@@ V In@@ it differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub @-@ file of / etc are instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c@@ .d@@ . D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folders :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service , which you want to start using the system or when changing to another running level . system services include such things like network , NFS , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services does not include such things like set@@ serial , which is only once started . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; r@@ c.@@ local should lie on the one hand under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems own this file , even if you don &apos;t want to create a r@@ c.@@ using in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something when you want to do something with the serial connection . &quot;
&quot; the kernel is looking for different places after the in@@ it program and starts the first , which he finds . &quot;
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find out that the pre @-@ set Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change that , you can manually edit / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab by hand and change the 3 . be very careful if you want to manually restart the system and execute the following : &quot;
&quot; but how do you start all the right scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the in@@ it@@ .@@ d directory .
&quot; how does it start and stops in@@ it , system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts are so written that there is an argument such as start and stop . you can indeed start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when an K includes , the script will stop using the argument stop . if it includes a S , the script will start with the argument . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could get &amp; eg ; a server running level , which can only run htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; S@@ end@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you can learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another index is easy to say : drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six run@@ level to launch it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also shift the scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere . this will only happen if they withdraw an entry from its original Run@@ level ( or its position ) .
&quot; note : entries are post@@ pon@@ ed when you pull them into a new area . to copy it only to a new Run@@ level , you need to select explicitly copy from the menu and add to the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of a entry can be not calculated sometimes . in such case , you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : there are currently no possibility to restore entries , which have been thrown into the paper basket . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ulator button to enable the different work@@ ranges ( Available System services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cur@@ sor keys to meet a selection of upper or below the previous . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X ) and insert it into the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to manually change sorting number or the name of an updated manually , press the input button to open the properties button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to dis@@ card the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are taken in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . pre@@ ferences are removed from &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; otherwise it will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I &apos;ve been experim@@ ented with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine will start ane@@ w . what can I do ? &quot;
&quot; enter the li@@ lo @-@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ itt@@ ab , and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) . &quot;
&quot; I provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; intended for version under running level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Del@@ ix ( D@@ LD ) you &apos;ll need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
&quot; the species , such as system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simplified the configuration for proprietary configuration programs in these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately no standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution , please check whether all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and even if they are in the correct directory ) just without a message if their configuration files are not present or false . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; running level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level , so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; c@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of &amp; user ;
&quot; after you have done changes , you have to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry store in the File menu . &quot;
&amp; user ; is a simple application . the main window is composed of two flash@@ cards , user and user groups . please select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group characteristics . &quot;
some flash@@ cards are only shown if you have activated extended system settings . only if you can use extended system settings . only if you can use limited system settings . further cards can appear if Shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d can be installed as in BSD Unix .
&quot; the card password must appear if shadow passwords , or e.g. / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d is installed as in BSD @-@ Unix . &quot;
&quot; this card card appears only if for at least a built @-@ in file system ( quota ) is enabled and initi@@ alized ( recogni@@ zable at the quot@@ as user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . here you can be changed for any user parameter , the limitation of limitation in KB are : &quot;
&quot; these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system will be selected using the field file system . &quot;
&quot; the cards are inform@@ ally informed of the group users of the selected user . the standard group , which belongs to the user , can be found in the Prim@@ ur Group . furthermore , the user can mark in other groups by adding them in the large field . &quot;
the dialogue properties of the group includes a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or a group , select adding of the user or group or click on the appropriate add @-@ button of the tool bar . editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works similar . &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the li@@ lo boat manager , add the Boot@@ pass@@ able , remove and change the time to the bo@@ oting of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
