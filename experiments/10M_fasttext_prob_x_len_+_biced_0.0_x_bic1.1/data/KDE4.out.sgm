<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also called Sabatier, a effect of the picture was created when one partially developed the brighter areas of dark and the colors caused by the second lighting. this tool was a partial negative of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar power. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. an additional increase creates a negative picture that is not possible to create photopleier."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system. the original picture is the (1) and the (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">The Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; -effect. it differs from a saturation that he has a stronger contrasts that makes the colours brilliant and glowing. try it easy to embellish many photos.</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an intense color film produced by Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet offers very popular colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias is highly saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts. Velvias is highly saturated colors but also some photographs that are hard to lify and too much.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neonlight on contrasts. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neonlight. in large pictures, the filter may trigger the whole CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">"digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual to adjust the color contrast and the luminous intensity of the photos. you can use the different color-basements of your photos with the menu below colours. once you are satisfied with the result, use the button Ok and you are used."</seg>
<seg id="418">If you get a photo at bad light conditions you can get the reverse problem. even in this case the tool for brightness / saturation can reduce your saturation instead of increasing it. if the result you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mold Gradation and the simple leukstarch / contrast / Gamma, the tool is set up to improve the exposure of exposure. even if dialogue with this tool is very complicated, you need only the range of sliding purposes only the range of slider. more specific the three slider below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graphs are three slider into which are clipped and the left side is to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digiate; exhibits three different tools for sharpening. each of them has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and simple, but, especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">Unsharfe mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. they can use it rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunst and it is a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and he is copyrighted by Winston Chang.</seg>
<seg id="482">"possibly the focus is probably the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adaptation."</seg>
<seg id="483">Photos without focus as well as most digitised images need to summarize. this is due to the digitalization process with only minimal differences to a color point. this means that sharp edges may be printed on paper. SLR cameras normally require more retrospeculation than normal cameras for the private user.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is frequently used for internal raising. images in the shell format must always be scanned in the processing format."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use sharpening filters already during the reading of the picture. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get usable results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening value. you can call up with the menu entry fee."</seg>
<seg id="487">"but should hereby be careful if the results are not very natural: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also reinforced the noise. in general, you can find more information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too tight. the solution to create a little soft is much easier than it. use the tool to adjust the softness with the menu entry, and experiment with you on the right side of the dialogue it shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter is unsharp masked is a very good tool to remove veils from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original picture and the preview can help edit the picture. this showcase shows the copy of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should be tried first. an increase of the radius or amount increases the effect. if you make the Unsharfe mask to make the noise and impression of grats near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius determines how many pixels are affected by the filter on each side. high resolution images allow bigger radians. they should therefore sharpens images best in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount is added to the percentage between the original and the wired picture, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is placed."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. it can therefore define a minimal difference for a edge of filter. in this way, areas with a soft change between tones of sharpening and therefore beauties are avoided in faces, heavens and water surface."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of unsharp filters. the original picture is the (1) and the processed image the (2). unsharp masked was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a swelling = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digiate; tool Refocus has focused on a picture of improving the edge. it used the copyright-protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to focus a picture to & quot; refocsierquot; this is better way to sharpens the photo. this is better than to try the photo. Refocus can usually start better results as unsharp masked. you can start it out of the menu by clicking using colors Refocus on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular fission work much better than the Gauß's Fender. the Gauß's Fender has a very long tail, which is far from the original distance pixel. the FIR Viennese Inverse is influenced by far off the remote pixel. this causes the unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular shifting. it is the most important parameters for the use of this module. for most pictures the default value should be 1 good results. you can set up a higher value if your image is very sharp and then in Heiligenscha.</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. suitable values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpest effect of module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase of smoke filter can help you reduce artifacts. however, values are higher than 0.1 but rarely useful. if the noise filter may be too low, and eg; 0 is very bad. a useful value is 0.03. a useful value is 0.03. a useful value is still tightened."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauß's sharpness. in most cases, you should add this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a zero value, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"die-size: this value determines the size of the transformatrix. an increase in die size can produce good results, especially if you choose large values for the circular code or of the Gauß. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">"the store as and store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any Refocus parameter is set for you to be saved, and then can be charged."</seg>
<seg id="505">"try all the cutting, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image. the reason for this is that much operations changes are not immediately visible immediately, which leave later unpleasant Artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read pictures and compress, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masked produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unsharp masked a larger neighborhood than sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, the result of the FIR Viennese filter has to be developed. even under optimal conditions it is possible to show that it is the optimal Lineare filter. practical, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is always at least just as good as the Unsharfe mask. the FIR Viennese filter is frequently better in handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between different filters, on a small unlimited picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp colour image has to be corrected. this picture has been made with an analog camera. the imfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="514">"the colour inks allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark, then you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">"the tool image error correction is one of the most developed tools, to remove non-desired Artefacts combined with unprecedented speed."</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm has been developed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different preferences as Starpoints to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings, you can use the tab cards and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail save p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a smooth glitter about the picture. however, a value of 0.9 should be so preserved, that no sharpening should be needed. please note that the details must always be subordinated to the surface dependence."</seg>
<seg id="520">"accuracy of Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly into all directions, while a value is close to 1 only in one direction. JPEG artifacts will create a high value of fibre-like pattern. JPEG artifacts will be best with a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatting [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor via all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, use this value matching the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter affects bigger structures. the higher this value is set, the more becomes smoothed if it is difficult to create the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh's turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetitions: can be run through the algorithm as often. usually 1 or 2 is normally enough.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle gradual da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of the anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small to create a long runtime. therefore, make sure that small angles should be a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and for your needs acceptable."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral stepper cent in pixels. you should avoid the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation: the More to quality you receive by selecting this option is only small. it doubles the runtime. we recommend it to allow him to leave.</seg>
<seg id="527">"to store buttons as well as loading, exactly this. any adjustment of image errors can now be saved in a text file and later recharged."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius will be controlled the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) which is used for the filter. large values increase the time of filters per pixel and can be rotated through the radius and the colour in it is smoothed, and thus smaller errors can be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the shark spacing. this value sets the pixel distance to the front. if it is increased, noise peaks are deleted. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details may not be preserved and roughitting or lubricate again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls the edge of edge for the sharpness. this value improves the response rate of the filter. if it is too strong, the whole space can be removed or noise peaks can occur. put it on a value close to the maximums, if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artifacts without any details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change either color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend you either color or luminance to change a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that controls the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gammatolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which typically become stronger. however, it also shifted the shadow zones."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controlled the adjustment of the phasenjittering absorption. this value defines how quickly the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges glatter will appear. if it is high, noise and phasenjitter may appear on the edges. it can remove noise tops and is the recommended method."</seg>
<seg id="542">"store up and load: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters on noise reduction, which you have set, can be saved in the file system and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="543">"this is an example of how noise reduction can change your lives. the original picture is labeled with (1) and the corrected (2), which was used with standard settings."</seg>

<seg id="546">"this filter for restoring gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts of your pictures. it is very well adapted to immerse Gauß's noise, film grain, compressive artefacts and local mistakes in digital, original or retrospectively digitised pictures, and therefore receives the content as it does the human eye."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture. the texture is performed with another tool, the image error correction, performed by the IMAGE team of the GREC CNRS laboratories in Caen / Franndale and is part of the Cimg project."</seg>

<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels have a distance of 1 of the pixel-block (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the standard filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block is pulled up to calculate an bi-square surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate an bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) that will then be used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>

<seg id="853">"with this KIPI module, you can import and convert your files stored in one of three formats JPEG, TIFF or PPM."</seg>
<seg id="854">The conversion is based on the command-set tool dcraw of Dave Coffin. a original quote from Him is: do not expect the same results as the software from your camera controllers. sometimes you get dcraw better results!.</seg>
<seg id="855">First select the RAW file that should be converted and launch the module. the Raw image converter window will then appear in mode for a single image. with the button you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides whether the camera settings are to be utilised. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can continue to process the image later."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected to use the contracting information. if your camera is working in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are happy with the preview, you can choose one of the three output formats and save it. the filename remains the same, and only the expansion will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a low-loss algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image format, TIFF, retains all the information of your image and use the lossless LZW compressing."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you prefer to edit your pictures frequently or later you should not use the JPEG format, since it only has a limited number of operations. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a storage format, the metadata is stored in the RAW file in the EXIF file."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adapted your settings, you can restart the conversion. if you want to break down the process again, you can use this process again."</seg>
<seg id="863">"the launching mode allows you to convert different pictures at once. use this mode therefore, if you are sure, for example, by testing on a single image that's the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images. however, you have to write the possibility of existing file automatically. this is helpful if these have been created in an earlier attempt. a preview is however not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced."</seg>

<seg id="1044">"if you turn on an anti-aliasing, calculates and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as standard is a adaptive non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is adaptive because each pixel is always divided and adaptive because the recurve depth depends on the calculated colour values.</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray include a beam of a pixel. if the difference between the values to the neighboring pixels, both pixels will be calculated using a certain additional number of pixels with super sampling. if you calculate the depth value of an additional number of pixels with extra points, a grid value of 5 then is 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1-r 2) + abs (g 1-g 2) + abs (b 1-b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference is exceeds the default threshold, the pixels is divided into 4 sub-pixel size, which can be checked individually and further on further classification. maximum depth of records can be adjusted using the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. if you switch jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>

<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3 kbps for complex music pieces and somewhat less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of titles. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for stereo-stereo systems with high quality."</seg>

<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size, then select this setting."</seg>

<seg id="1527">"in connection with body programs, there are often a combination of programming settings for the Kodierer and these parameters here. the manual or help to the Kodiers declare the switch for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; to add the title to the keyword (English: day) if MP3s must be encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters must be added; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & caudioCreator; for use of FreeDb, the closest mirror server will be needed. this saves bandwidth on the network and resembles the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of Spiegelservers for online departures of & CD; information on reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the actualizations of the database.</seg>

<seg id="1536">"there is rumors that cdparanoia is used; if you want to know it, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading the audio CD;. to note that the cdparanoia package has to be installed first if this is not done yet."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the selected WAV files, the Kodierer can be selected and therefore select the desired file format. at first open, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a loss-free compression of audio data) can be added to the tab. other coals can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the Kodierer package needs to be installed from the relevant Linux distribution, before the Kodierer can be used. this is also necessary for the pre-defined codierer. more information about Kodierer can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer."</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is necessarily necessary for synthesizer, which are not general-MIDI-capable. in this case, the MIDI-Map general-MIDI-events translated into events that synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI-map that converts all events of the type Change patch to Bright piano in the type Change patch to trumpet and therefore always sound a trumpet, if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you only have a sound card, you don't need MIDI-Map because all sound cards are GM compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM equipment and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"unfortunately, there are no programs to create MIDI-maps. so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand (with your favorite ditor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">"a MIDI-map is a text file, which stores all necessary conversions for the play of a piece."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except that KEYMAP section, which may appear as often as desired. requirements for this, however, that each occurrence has a different text ID (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">Define PATCHMAP... End Define KEYMAP "Name of the Keymap"... End Define CHANNELMAP... end options... End of the... End</seg>
<seg id="1659">"you see that Define is used to indicate that a section begins (except for options) and end, that the end of a section is reached."</seg>
<seg id="1660">"please send me your map file as e-mail, so that in future versions of & kmid; support can offer for devices that are not general-MIDI compatible."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"in this section, the patches of General MIDI is depicted on your specific keyboard. the general use looks as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored. it is believed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order, and also no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to lay all the sounds you need to put this instrument on the tone with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a tissue sample (e.g. with tone 60), you can do a drum (e.g. with tone 60), which can do the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if now a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (tissue signal), it will take Patch 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, irrespective of which tone in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the concept drum patch of the patch is meant to form a different percussionary instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the always the same drum (like some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">KEYMAP section is used to specify how sounds are shown on a certain channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important, as well as its presence. you need to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">"for each channel, you can define multiple keyboard for each channel and you must only use different names in the first line."</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keywords are used mainly to map sounds on the perkine channel. look for example the supplied keyboard maps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels on others. if you want to share the first and second channel, you simply do it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is part of the channel that is depicted on the channel N. if you use the keymap option, you will need to change the keymap with the name name for this channel. if you are using the ForcePatch option, all events will definitely try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x is used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can be useful for example, to always use the perkine patch on the perkine channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio will be multiplied in which ratio of pitch-Bender events will be multiplied. if so, a MIDI file will be converted with the value n * (r / 4096) and then redirected to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then be forwarded with the formula n * (r / 4096) so that in the map file there is no decimals."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed, because GM is prescribed that a keyboard that is to play a pitch higher with the value 4096 to play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards around two sounds want to play up to a octave. to try the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, open the dialog MIDI settings. you can find in the menu below settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">"the channel view is a window with a whole set of piano (one for each MIDI channel). see these piano, which sounds just played."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a select list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed a instrument, the button doesn't use more green but red, to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (until now) two different views to indicate the displayed tones. the view of the menu settings below the point of Kanalview: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed, with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find a song be too fast to follow the text, you can slow down. to change the pace, use the arrows to the left and right from the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how a music piece has to be played. it contains the scores, rhythm, speed, & etc. therefore, the same MIDI file can lead to very different devices, just like two different musicians play the same scores in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I cannot be able to force & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file needs 4 MB (an compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer. in a MIDI file you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc. you have control of everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary (rpm, deb) of & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support, you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's homepage)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I want to add a whole folder to a collection, but I don't want to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"understood, that's why & kmid; drag & drop. simply open the folder you want to add into & Conqueror;, select all files, and drag them to the & kmid; -window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"before, enable the automatic adjustment to the collection in advance. otherwise, the files are added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1689">You can click the arrow keys from the Tempo- LCD to slow down the playback. to restore the standard tempo you can click on the LCD.</seg>
<seg id="1690">"I have on a & KDE; desktop computer with my MIDI file and & kmid; on this desktop, I have to play if the collection is played at the end or I want to play a file, only switch into the & Conqueror; -window and move the desired file into the window of & kmid."</seg>

<seg id="2282">"the merging was very complicated, because one of the contributions made many changes and simultaneously had changed the objection. another programmer had changed much text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts with merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me was only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within that lines. and there were no clues on the places where perhaps only the recovery had changed. the merge of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">That was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could display differences in line and changes to white characters. later any amount of other useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it into the clipboard and add it in one of the comparative window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function made a lot of work, was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & diffdiff3; almost in a full file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">"also, 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful if two people work independently in a piece of code and make changes. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. this image shows three quell files at merging:"</seg>

<seg id="2290">Differences in white signs and tabulators are shown clearly. if lines only differ in a certain number of white characters you can see it at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no harm changes if there is no problem.)</seg>
<seg id="2291">"when one file is equal, and the other differs in a line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both files are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name, but in different folders, you can simplify your work by typing only the filenames of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"diffuse, folder 2, folder 1 folder 2-o target bindings, diff3 folder 2 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder 3 folder"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the opening dialog allows the manual typing of filenames, the selection of the file browser (file...) or select a recently opened file from the list of file. if you don't have to leave the file for C, the analysis of the differences are carried out with two files."</seg>

<seg id="2512">"if your mouse is restarted, you should clean your mouse. it is normally quite simple. the trick is in doing so that you do not only cleanse the mouse ball, but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball."</seg>

<seg id="2516">This happens when you use & kmousetool; using another window manager and move a window.</seg>
<seg id="2517">The solution for this problem is that you own a mouse click here. here the status of & kmousetool; reset and you can continue to work as usual.</seg>
<seg id="2518">Problem: if you type text is tried & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another place.</seg>

<seg id="2524">"to use & kmousetool; to be used, the XTest extension for & X Window; must be installed. this should be the case in most cases."</seg>

<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar, in order to filter a selected criterion or according to the specified string. in the default setting, the selection panel is displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a protocol line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search is contained."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"of course, you can also select another entry in this place. the string method is then selected only with entries in the accordingly selected column. for example in the filter bar the name of a process then show you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines are sent out, which were sent out of this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">This option is activated in the default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines. protocol lines of level errors are displayed with a striking color as protocol-lines of level note. the color representation of protocol-lines can be switched-in dialog.</seg>
<seg id="2951">"do you only want to display certain process (for example in system log or cron protocol), so you can check the process identification (PID) in the column process. this can be useful if you want to investigate the output of a specific command, such as the start of the samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to enable new lines in the context menu of the main window to display all new release lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; enables the display of several protocol files in separate lower windows. to open this function, use the entries in the menu window to open and manage the menu window to display an additional subwindow. once you have selected a window, select an ad in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has a website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. please find more recent information about the source of & ksystemlog;</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also available in the following folder of the & KDE; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & KDE; -Archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & KDE; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section holds a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the system V Init develops quickly to the standard for control of the program starts in the & Linux; world. therefore, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and even more flexible than the traditional BSD-Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I'm not going to go further on historical aspects (i.e. because I don't know about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because someone might try to make a machine on system V Init, without a reinstallation and reformat. therefore, you need to ensure that the old Init was removed from there if there was there."</seg>
<seg id="2960">SYSV Init differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a sub-file of / etc are instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folders:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service, which you want to start using the system or when changing to another running level. system services include such things like network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services does not include such things like setserial, which is only once started. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"rc.local should lie on the one hand under / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems own this file, even if you don't want to create a rc.using in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something when you want to do something with the serial connection."</seg>
<seg id="2963">"the kernel is looking for different places after the init program and starts the first, which he finds."</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can throw a look into the second column and probably find out that the pre-set Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. be very careful if you want to manually restart the system and execute the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how do you start all the right scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">You will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead every entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory.</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how does it start and stops init, system services? quite simple: each of the scripts are so written that there is an argument such as start and stop. you can indeed start this scripts by hand on the command line as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when an K includes, the script will stop using the argument stop. if it includes a S, the script will start with the argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could get & eg; a server running level, which can only run httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. also, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you can learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another index is easy to say: drag an entry from the range of availability system services to one of the six runlevel to launch it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also shift the scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by moving it elsewhere. this will only happen if they withdraw an entry from its original Runlevel (or its position).</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are postponed when you pull them into a new area. to copy it only to a new Runlevel, you need to select explicitly copy from the menu and add to the target range -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target range of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry can be not calculated sometimes. in such case, you have to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: there are currently no possibility to restore entries, which have been thrown into the paper basket. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to enable the different workranges (Available System services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to meet a selection of upper or below the previous."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it into the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to manually change sorting number or the name of an updated manually, press the input button to open the properties button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are taken in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are removed from & ksysv; otherwise it will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local sysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I've been experimented with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine will start anew. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">"enter the lilo-Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab, and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine)."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I provided some system services with & ksysv; intended for version under running level X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">If you are using & SuSE; or Delix (DLD) you'll need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution.</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the species, such as system services are started in these distributions, simplified the configuration for proprietary configuration programs in these distributions, but unfortunately no standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution, please check whether all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and even if they are in the correct directory) just without a message if their configuration files are not present or false."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; running level varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the runlevel, so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & user; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>
<seg id="2990">To start with & cuser; it is sufficient to read the chapter adaptation of & user;</seg>
<seg id="2991">"after you have done changes, you have to save them. either use the corresponding symbol of the tool bar or the entry store in the File menu."</seg>
<seg id="2992">& user; is a simple application. the main window is composed of two flashcards, user and user groups. please select the desired user or the desired group with a double-click on the entry. it appears the dialog user or group characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2993">Some flashcards are only shown if you have activated extended system settings. only if you can use extended system settings. only if you can use limited system settings. further cards can appear if Shadow-passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd can be installed as in BSD Unix.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"the card password must appear if shadow passwords, or e.g. / etc / master.passwd is installed as in BSD-Unix."</seg>
<seg id="2995">"this card card appears only if for at least a built-in file system (quota) is enabled and initialized (recognizable at the quotas user / quota.group on the file system). here you can be changed for any user parameter, the limitation of limitation in KB are:"</seg>
<seg id="2996">"these parameters can be set individually for each file system. the current file system will be selected using the field file system."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the cards are informally informed of the group users of the selected user. the standard group, which belongs to the user, can be found in the Primur Group. furthermore, the user can mark in other groups by adding them in the large field."</seg>
<seg id="2998">The dialogue properties of the group includes a list of all users. to add a user to the group, mark this user in the list. "</seg>
<seg id="2999">"to add a user or a group, select adding of the user or group or click on the appropriate add-button of the tool bar. editing or delete the selected user or the selected group works similar."</seg>
