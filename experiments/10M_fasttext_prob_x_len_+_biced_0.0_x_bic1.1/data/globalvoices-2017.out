although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love to America is extremely large .
&quot; how many of my generation I grew up with American movies , I have dancing at American music , read American authors and operated his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had an incredibly profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The Pel@@ ican letter , a fear@@ less journalist , who , with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student , was the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who had his interest incl@@ ined . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year , which I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the United States . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country where I ever lived , its diversity is so inviting , that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people . &quot;
I even had a very small love letter concerning his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
a lot has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and rac@@ ism of this man .
&quot; the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me , as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded . &quot;
&quot; he never stops on the mountain , as one says so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he considers , as a former colleague said it , and publicly declared his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African American and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his testimony and agreed in dro@@ ves for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes , which he won with the Republican presidential election , was the highest number hit by the party . &quot;
I was speech@@ less .
who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot person I asked me ?
&quot; I was able to get Tr@@ ump and his elec@@ tors , not to bring people in harmony with the people I met during my time in Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism program , bringing people out of all over the world , a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps also voted World Heritage L@@ ecture with Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er , &quot; the present editor of the &quot; Cincinnati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; in the game .
&quot; tr@@ um@@ ps int@@ oler@@ ance also stands in contrast to gener@@ osity which I experienced at Sandy B@@ ahr , who fought for their lives in the environment , and her husband Dave , my family of family who did me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits the Com@@ mit@@ ment of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and my colleagues helped us to gain the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then Andrew Lec@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors who helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and those em@@ bodied by them are deep@@ ened my love to America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a halt and the equivalent of its limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 over 50 million Americans stated that white , the Presidency of a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the idea of the idea that people had voted for Tr@@ ump because they shared either his rac@@ ism and fan@@ at@@ ism , or because they were willing to over@@ looked these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is un@@ fair to call the ump @-@ voters as r@@ assi@@ sts .
&quot; to arrange people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superf@@ ici@@ ally and respec@@ t@@ less and indicates an in@@ ability to understand those who act on a different way and think .
it shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into consideration beyond the hec@@ tic changes in their communities .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of whom most know are , for Tr@@ ump , because they want to reg@@ ain control over a country that she has disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; but one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ edy , who comments the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look differently than he . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( An@@ m . ) . : as much as &quot; Re@@ jection of the White against all other eth@@ nic@@ ities &quot; ; the word of white in order to the White and Whi@@ pl@@ ash , which means that great Van Jones , has exactly that which America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - what faith or background can always have , America is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as his pre@@ sidents , twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose story , as he himself says , nowhere else were possible in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the vote Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps , there is a huge part of white &apos;s America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with complexity , religious freedom , and the full term of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America , after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the rest , they say . &quot;
&quot; at all this , I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who was in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for Hillary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , could my son , captain Hum@@ ay@@ un K@@ ahn , could have a place in your America ? &quot; Mr Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; breaks the crowd .
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! they cried , and their voices were lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone who is not so is like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NE@@ IN . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , is that not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son was fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
this is now Tr@@ um@@ ps Land .
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find no place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart to me .

&quot; what has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero congregation in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca , with the children of the par@@ agu@@ a@@ ean town of Cat@@ e@@ ura together ? &quot;
&quot; the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also has a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump , just 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; an old colonial town that is very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colom@@ bian ruins and its world famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years , the La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has now been playing in the municipality : one of children and adults consist of existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found its musical instruments a way to overcome poverty . &quot;
&quot; a music school with 100 students , has become the central interest for the municipality of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca . &quot;
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the municipality , located in one of the poorest provinces , Mexico , is well @-@ known for their drugs abuse and the B@@ anden force . &quot;
&quot; however , after a random meeting with a French pilots who started a musical project and the youth had always offered a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; young band members take their comm@@ itments vis to the music group very serious , the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI writes : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come and play with shining eyes and play in the gu@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , trombone , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , o@@ boe , flute , forest horn , ti@@ mp@@ ani , Bon@@ g@@ os and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from MÃ¼@@ ll
&quot; more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura - a village that is practically produced on the largest land@@ fill of As@@ unci@@ on in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments which are made from re@@ b@@ able waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ decorated instruments which consist of local solid waste materials , manufactured in a workshop for musical instruments in Cat@@ e@@ ura , where the recycling of Fa@@ vio ChÃ¡vez had begun to transform parts of the waste in instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments include violin , viola , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , gu@@ itars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets , trump@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ ischen and Latin American music as well as music of Beatles , Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Cha@@ vez speaks a local ec@@ ologist and musical teachers of the children of Cat@@ e@@ ura , to the initial time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach in the same place , where the parents worked in the mill . the children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents , because many of them do not live with their children . &quot;
that changed when Fa@@ vio was something that he never had seen before : a sort of waste produced Viol@@ in .
&quot; today , there is a complete orchestra which plays on instruments from re @-@ prepared material and called The Recy@@ cled Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world produces approximately one billion metric tons of rub@@ b@@ ish every year .
&quot; those who live with him and live from him are the trouble - like men in Cat@@ e@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they transform him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational drama of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
this East African countries show how technology and team work successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that the wild illegal fishing fights .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that targeted over international , practic@@ ed solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the publication happens within the context of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already been operating in Liberia waters on illegal fishing before it was found on the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were raised correspon@@ d@@ ingly and little incl@@ ined to welcome a bar@@ rage of this species to their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles of mobil@@ ised rapidly against the ship . they refused to eat one of their ports and refused to give him a fisher@@ man permission . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the Prime Minister surrounded by countries who simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; remembers Bene@@ dict Ki@@ il@@ u , an executive employee of the Ken@@ yan F@@ isheries Agency . it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was driven out of the waters of the region : it didn &apos;t manage to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pill@@ aging the country &apos;s pill@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , the criminal practices crosses and protects resources , F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal fishing ( stop Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , members of this network are the six countries that were exp@@ elled from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are in@@ sol@@ itary and work together . they exchange information and stand each other at where it &apos;s illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , Head of Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding illegal fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden since it is extremely difficult to tap it . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing region . &quot;
&quot; by deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , which are supposed to be protected by certain habit@@ ats and types , illegal fishing ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; however , during actions against illegal fishing once and through bureaucr@@ atic obstacles were imp@@ aired , and also by the snow@@ ck@@ ent@@ emp@@ o , with the information between different countries , these actions occur in real @-@ time , tra@@ ce@@ able on F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; the individual countries , for example , can exchange lists existing licenses , news for susp@@ icious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive , when they move on the open lake , via satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this enables the authorities to identify ships which fish in banned areas - such as susp@@ icious driving gro@@ oves - such that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the involved ships have a catch license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can be found on the basis of this information , which means that the ships can not be sold in their ports . and that they could not be forced to sell their charge , as in the case of the Premier . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about significant financial losses for the owner , which means illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore . &quot;
&quot; and that is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Chief Executive director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is an en@@ forcement company which is committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already known platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales , which lose eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network every year due to the Il@@ legal fishermen that inv@@ ade in East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies , which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world . under these also illegal fishermen . &quot;
&quot; among others , actions include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license documents , inscription of Phant@@ as@@ en@@ amen , the fish protected species and the fish in protected areas . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they are targeted to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weak@@ nesses of a non @-@ bridge organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; formerly a ship could be fishing and a country could say &apos; You must not run my port . &quot;
but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &apos; and precisely this leg@@ ale gor@@ ges tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now .
so far the closed front works .
&quot; since its foundation , F@@ ISH @-@ i participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks , which had spread counter@@ feit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships which used several frau@@ dul@@ ent ident@@ ities , and it has found some wing@@ ed ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for fighting crimes , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share information on illegal fishing via large distances and preserved . &quot;
&quot; some of our investigations lead us fairly well to the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; it builds a system , which aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i susp@@ ects the susp@@ icious ships of precise . &quot;

fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system that will always be developed and also helps to cover illegal ships to hide themselves .
&quot; &quot; the Il@@ legal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Duncan Cop@@ eland , Master analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , a N@@ RO with f@@ isheries data and F@@ ISH @-@ i support technical support . &quot;
&quot; for example , some of the ships will switch off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be used by satellites . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system that combines different information levels together . it should help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find crimin@@ ating ships with larger precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations have influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes it . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each individual tra@@ ce@@ able ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbours , to get a better image of it , who knows what is doing , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to the investigation . &quot;
we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; Pe@@ w Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts has a similar project to run with which a global system allows for the persecution of ships .
there are indications that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities are not only crimin@@ als but they are also deter them .
&quot; ships , which previously conf@@ is@@ cated without license and had hardly to calculate with consequences , know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ ISH @-@ i took a 33 % increase in fishing sales ever since fishing boats anymore . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had assisted Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board lock nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we &apos;re an academic project . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries were closed together , so called West Africa Task Force , too . they now fight illegal fishing , following the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with security is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member of Somalia could report his first big triumph in October : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was under a false flag . and not only the ship was used without a license and have been forbidden to use to@@ wing networks . &quot;
&quot; the ship was still prohibited in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the action of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 put them a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing . &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the evidence that such a special , collabor@@ ative approach to protecting the oceans .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the application of opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ians re@@ acted the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country in which they gathered themselves on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( approximately : the withdrawal of Venezuela ) can be found in both pictures of these demonstrations , as well as arguments for and against them . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be led in other parts of the country - amongst others in the Bar@@ inas &apos;s low@@ lands , in the An@@ den@@ regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira , centrally located on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ as@@ a . &quot;
the political and economic situation of the country deterior@@ ates continuously what is noticeable in the everyday life of the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ ans by acute short@@ age of food and drugs .
many representatives of the opposition have seen the chance of a fundamental change in the official President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro ; ultimately the sever@@ ance of a new choice was blocked by the official authorities .
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summar@@ ises in their latest articles in the context of government statement as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation and ge@@ wal@@ tr@@ ate belong to the highest all over the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and extensive lack of food and medicine , the referendum was for many as the only way to restore its institutional structures and join a new government alliance . &quot;

&quot; the call was commented on Twitter among other things , as follows : &quot;

especially large waves struck the news about pol@@ ishing oppression in the central @-@ west city of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , protest@@ ers moved back to the local cathedral , in order to protect themselves according to their own statement before the police and armed pro@@ pon@@ ents of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ den@@ State T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ ch@@ ira don &apos;t wear a skirts , because you could not see something many nation@@ alities don &apos;t have ! &quot;

many representatives of the government had asked the validity of the demand for a counter @-@ counter procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .

the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced to view the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argentine city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano said now in the frame of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano is not looking for his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden , same name as his father , to bear the brutal military operations at La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept his family secrets .
&quot; in the situation , I believed that was in order . &quot;
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years , you don &apos;t remember that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; I could not recognize that my father was a thief , tort@@ ur@@ ers and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie@@ officials . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the intelligence department 141 at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppressed because of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and the kidn@@ apping of a 10 @-@ year child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ o &apos;s son , a man who had experienced the magn@@ itude of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and he testified before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows that great power has a parent over his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the Sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take home to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had been working with a boy , the mar@@ tial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and some days later he showed me a black and white photo , and called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are an ass@@ hole , you have become friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; think that they do not have a day , and I must save you . &quot;
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pueb@@ lo - the Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolutionary Democratic Party of Argentina .
&quot; therefore he for@@ b@@ ade me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later , he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be obe@@ y@@ ent . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that was fine . for so my father had taken me up .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers that heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , handwritten notes , literature , certificates , prop@@ ag@@ and@@ am@@ ity , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ da dr@@ um@@ ming the prisoners become tortured
my father scored a total of four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
&quot; on the first and last time , he left me at the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to go out . he led me to a bar@@ racks , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small tree wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to wear it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the bar@@ racks where the stolen items were shut down , and maintained me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said :
prisoners are tortured here .
&quot; I went in , and saw a lying lying on man . &quot;
she looked like a water@@ bed and metal springs .
&quot; later I found out that they hold it at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person , which was just there . &quot;
&quot; they spread a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , shot him with water and hun@@ ted a load of 220 volt into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the tank there was horri@@ ble ... like a dirty win@@ ch .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I became clear that this is the smell of a body in need .
I never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a man can do so much sorrow ?
I knew that these people were killed &apos;
&quot; as my father joined the work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were tied to eyel@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , an civilians who also was tried in the process ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were buried with the face down - all were tied on hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; in the proximity of the entering , people quietly wait for the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw to the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you think so , ass@@ hole ? &quot;
I met &quot; Why have you brought me anything else ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
&quot; they were thrown into a pit , and killed by soldiers and buried there . &quot;
I know this because my father spoke at home .
&quot; besides La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were known as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero struck a man there and killed .
&quot; according to survivors from the civilian , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of trial in the La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera , was also accused of the students of Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emilio F@@ essi@@ a , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way where you came in here is also the way , on which the left arrived here . &quot;
&quot; when you look on the map , see that they took about this path and tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number assigned to the process of de@@ formation . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the prisoners arrived at the top that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war of war &apos;
&quot; my father brought all the stolen things , home . &quot;
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; war of war &quot; - how they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was later in the military , - I was in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war@@ fare is a Ba@@ j@@ on@@ et or perhaps military sign , which one takes away from an enemy . &quot;

&quot; but if you walk into a house and the refrigerator , the turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then it is no war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I always asked myself , as my father , the leader of security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the G@@ end@@ ar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have happened to get into a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered : and you , who walk on the road ? &quot;
you are not crimin@@ als ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me , and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and stand alone . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a picture of that time , on which I wore a jacket and a roller pul@@ lover from wool . I had both my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes with home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence asked me to have been with this crime . I said , no problem , they can lay down for me what they wanted . &quot;
&quot; anyway , I was there to say . &quot;
&apos;@@ The disappearance of the body is the last ab@@ hor@@ ical act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel rep@@ ented . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if one only has children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
&quot; it is developed further , and recogni@@ zes that it is false to kill . &quot;
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you were ex@@ iled during the dictatorship . but what the bodies will disappear ? &quot;
why do children manage it ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with home whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; it was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
&quot; they could have been , however , to be put into prison . &quot;
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but what will her cor@@ p@@ ses leave disappear ?
did these people not have families who were able to surrender their mort@@ al remains ?
the cas@@ ual account is the last ab@@ hor@@ ical act that can do a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they hol@@ ed machines to eliminate the mort@@ al rem@@ nants of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and cared for somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
&quot; but anything remains , of course . &quot;
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people ! &apos;
only to clear it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gen@@ dar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 crimin@@ als - including my father .
&quot; the thought , to indicate my father , was developed during a conversation when he was placed under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience for him . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly and asked me , for what the whole displaced Patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian emotions , &quot; which they allegedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me what to me ?
I &apos;ve seen how you killed people !
&quot; you have committed horri@@ ble crime , and you have forced me as a child to participate . &quot;
&quot; he just answered , &quot; Well , I don &apos;t show me . &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
&quot; in 2010 , I filed the first indication . &quot;
&quot; finally , I realized that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can tell me that I am pre@@ set . I finally have said against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still at the end of the trial .
&quot; he was indicted for 416 off@@ ences : including serious , illegal imprisonment in 158 cases , torture in 154 cases , murder in 98 especially serious cases , torture with subsequent death sentence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of a under 10 year &apos;s child . &quot;

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magn@@ itude of the sentence .
&quot; after four years , in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended in August 1975 and December 1978 crimes committed against 7@@ 16 victims in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppressed for crimes against humanity is found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases sentenced to life sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there was no acqu@@ itt@@ al . &quot;
eleven of the 54 accused died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ pet@@ ition : murder , torture and rape by counter@@ parts . # Es@@ warm State terrorism &quot;
&quot; all def@@ endants were members of the military , including former military officers , former police officers and civil employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mont@@ i was kidnapped and brought to La Per@@ la with his pregnant woman in June 1976 .
he addressed the following words to the silence chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the Court is an historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for the victims for years .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argentine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. founded in 1995 , representing the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the trial lasted more than three years , but research took over 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government transferred the country to La Per@@ la , where there was a memorial to be erected there , which is now headed by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto with &quot; terrible drivers &quot;
the sign with the translation defect at a centre in Kyoto in which you can extend his driving licence .
the picture was spread in social media .
elabor@@ ation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Kyoto city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which you can extend his driving licence during the last month , witnesses of a completely un@@ successful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign the Japanese word , the &quot; &quot; old motor@@ ist &quot; , &quot; which means &quot; older drivers &quot; means , fal@@ sely - maybe even with ar@@ cing rear axle &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; as a &quot; fear@@ ful motor@@ ist &quot; was translated . &quot;
&quot; the wrong translation was from 1 to 20 September to electronic ads in the entrance area , and to read in the building itself . &quot;
&quot; mechan@@ isation of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was divided in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the mistake was pleased with the translator Julian Holmes , a resident Ky@@ ot@@ os , who was also attentive to the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Kyoto Shim@@ bu@@ n newspaper wrote in Kyoto :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult for older people and an international city as Kyoto simply un@@ acceptable , &quot; said Holmes . &quot;
&quot; the wrong English translation was initially removed . the designation &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; was later removed by the appropriate drivers &quot; &quot; Dri@@ vers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; horri@@ ble car driver &quot; ) , and it was not quite the correct name &quot; El@@ der Dri@@ vers &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police in Kyoto pre@@ ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation defect . furthermore , she explained that the error was already included in the text which they had received from the translator , and that translation was not checked before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger told how follows the exc@@ use :
&quot; we are sorry that older people felt ins@@ ulting by the in@@ sufficient correction ( the translation ) , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ Cast News used some more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terrible &quot; was den@@ ounced as in@@ adequate description of old motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers involved in accidents are involved , but quite an opportunity to worry about . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ fecture , a total of 19.@@ 460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005 , equivalent to a 10 % share . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , they caused seniors 1,@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; in this case , their share increased to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of seniors caused accidents during the same period . &quot;
&quot; the nam@@ es@@ accid@@ entally not mentioned in the article published in Yahoo comments on the light , which show what pre@@ judi@@ ces are some Japanese seem@@ ingly against older drivers : &quot;
the article on Yahoo concerning the translation errors was given the following comments :
- &quot; is this ( &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) not the reality ?
&quot; - &quot; If faul@@ t@@ less is the translation of all , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in all Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true mine for this bizarre mistake in English .
photo of Fli@@ ck@@ r users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide dis@@ sem@@ ination of trans@@ lators are varied .
&quot; to transfer , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires active domin@@ ation of the target language - something that is in language skills . generally , the conviction that translator should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speaker . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native language should translate into French in French - not from the French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language , which could make translations into English . this may lack understanding for the transfer , cost reasons , or the relatively small number of English native speakers , which learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , some companies that have no foreign employees cannot be fir@@ mer@@ ally . then the Japanese staff , whose English knowledge is considered the best to be trans@@ lators , no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Karl Baron .
machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the wor@@ r@@ ative and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences created by machine translation , show that this technology can not replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English forums in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic print@@ outs that are often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for ili@@ stic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless . but of large companies or from the government that have the means of ensuring higher standards , you can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto uses a seri@@ ousness source for their translations . &quot;
Venezuela : to take protests and c@@ ens@@ ation measures on the Internet and television
main page of the Port@@ als &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ t@@ ad &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ YS ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y So@@ c@@ ie@@ dad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , 7 April , Venezuel@@ an Internet users reported that they do not have access to the online transmitter Viv@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that Internet access from V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV wrote also no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online channel transm@@ itting images of the protests in Caracas , which were organised by op@@ positi@@ onal groups that oppos@@ e the Government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the duties of the Parliament to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author near Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is ste@@ amed , and recommended the user to get VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# Z@@ ens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages of Venezuel@@ an providers closed again .
this is from the page of @ Viv@@ o@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; as Viv@@ op@@ lay are popular with internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , traditional media have been hes@@ itated for protests . at that time , the Commission aimed at telecommunic@@ ation with fin@@ es and closing , when the Commission continued to report this as &quot; Call for Viol@@ ence . &quot; &quot;
without cable television and an informative national television channels I have logged in @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of lem@@ on@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro later confirmed that not only Viv@@ op@@ lay is in@@ accessible by a blocking of the domain name system ( DNS ) , but also two additional online transmitter . this also concerns the website where the National Assembly carries their meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier studies of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ YS ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , revealed that the local Internet service providers had to take up DNS . this is a technique by using the DNS @-@ server requests of certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server response or ref@@ uses the request to call such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS sper@@ re : @ el@@ ul@@ oli@@ ot@@ v and @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; at V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , the transmission was posted on Thursday , April 6th , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flo@@ res , who brought the protests in Caracas , was taken into custody . &quot;
Flo@@ res was beaten while sitting in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back again .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus , the Vene@@ z@@ ol@@ an@@ ers will continue to continue access to multi @-@ media coverage of the actual events in the country . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls become slaves to get a training
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child for Cri@@ ad@@ ita . now she visits the house where she worked for many years .
&quot; today Tina for the rights of children and colle@@ cts stuff to other cri@@ es , which were exactly as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the shortened version of a curator , which was published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission by the authors . &quot;
&quot; article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; &quot; flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) , which is edited and re@@ produced by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , where she didn &apos;t work together with the family who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before she graduated from the university , she returned to the home again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride in her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she started working as Cri@@ ad@@ ita for the family . in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to work to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is very simple : a big family with little money is over their under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another , more plentiful family . in exchange , the child will receive food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned above is that the children can afford numerous days of household work that will never be paid , and will never be paid for victims of abuse and abuse , and all that in the context of a contract you can &apos;t lift up . &quot;
this is widely used as Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go in Paraguay because of the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many complaints of human rights organisations .
&quot; after completion of her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ ad@@ itas - especially young girls , who are concerned about the practice of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go - collected witness , re@@ acted and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call the things on behalf , as the feeling of gratitude , which is vacc@@ inated the cri@@ es , guarantees in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family , who have their daughter in the belief that they conclude their education , improve their position in society and can do something from itself &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family stands that the girl is taking up and its exploitation by faith is just@@ ifies to someone who wouldn &apos;t have a chance to get an apprentices@@ hip as otherwise . &quot;
the Vic@@ tims of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experienced it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which is in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n was hosp@@ itali@@ zed in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent stro@@ kes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ ad@@ ita in household of former military leader Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as an official at the residential community .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ reira proposed as long as a stick to Mar@@ Ã­n until the fatal injuries suffered . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported on incident .
she felt that the murdered child was a Cri@@ ad@@ ita .
organizations like UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the sense of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go &apos;s practice responsible for the death of the girl &apos;s death .
they signed the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came to protest together and demanded that there may be no further Carolina in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in social media .
&quot; more cows are registered in Paraguay , compl@@ ac@@ ed by Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of married and nearly 60 civil society organisations demanded an intensive study of the case .
they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ reira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girls who was their cri@@ es to be sentenced to 30 years in prison .
&quot; if the case is in case of judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n could be landmark - if the case for the first time in the history of Paraguay is a case of Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go before court comes . &quot;
everyday life of an Cri@@ ad@@ ita
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ itas won &apos;t only exploited as a workforce , they are also isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , where her father worked , lost bank@@ rupt@@ cy and lost her father &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers , however , had to work all work and started selling sweets on the street or in the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on in the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of their employer between four and six hours every day .
&quot; in doing so , she had to share the time that it remained time for learning . &quot;
she got up every morning at 5 o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employer .
&quot; for example , she cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and all the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was at the end , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she had finished with learning , the more free time it had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to get more books from the library of the house@@ holder as food from the fridge , &quot; she remembers . &quot;
&quot; the library was well appointed and belonged to the house@@ holder , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some depar@@ tures of the House@@ er@@ r Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , in addition to him and Editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; or &quot; El Pueb@@ lo &quot; to read . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince her to give the reports of the official media on the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he held them for intelligent , but did not hold with her . &quot; the house@@ keeper had found someone who spoke to politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not allow me to visit my family often because they were the opinion that I would have to learn &quot; bad habits , &quot; that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , which belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ ani , would speak to their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the education that they had made , again , explains them . &quot;
&quot; it was , however , completely clear that she had paid for everything they had paid with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was also discri@@ minated in school . &quot; one thing about which almost never talked about , are mo@@ b@@ bing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans who cri@@ es to school if they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children of parents have parents , they immediately recognize that someone who has no parents , is a Cri@@ ad@@ ita . &quot;
I could not invite anyone home to me . I had no friends in school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships arise , I felt very much that I belonged to no group . &quot;
&quot; the isolation was the worst of everything , &quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a explains . &quot;
the society cheap the Cri@@ ada@@ z@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook Group where you can share a job for cleaning personnel and children &apos;s maid in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group of the group is Pep@@ a Ko@@ z@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city tour in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;

&quot; starting from Monday , when possible . &quot;
the ad got five &quot; Lik@@ es &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the village Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a el@@ dest girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman , who came from Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 year old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comments was written by &quot; a girl from the inner inner , which wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the author of the display turned out again :
dear friends . I &apos;ve found one . I &apos;ll look if it works with her .

bill writes Egyptian users social media to register with government

sixty Egyptian parliamentary report recently voted a bill to &quot; cover the regulations regarding the usage and working social networks . &quot;
&quot; if he is accepted by Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt with a government agency to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; based on the law then a place would be set up , which is instructed to share civil liberties and citizens to share social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the acceptance of the law , users have to register their users on the site with their correct name and number of personnel to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it be negle@@ cted to do this , so that a sentence could be sentenced by up to six months in jail or cash . &quot;
&quot; the bill that consists of six par@@ agra@@ phs and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; jed@@ we@@ de application , which runs on the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video and text . &quot;
&quot; it is un@@ clear as the law is en@@ forced , as the draft is being adopted , as Egyptian authorities do not notice the user &apos;s users who are not to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to register with the fact that the Egyptian government is not able to ensure the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Abdul Satt@@ ar , parliamentary and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered user names and users received a user name and password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall at national level around Facebook . because of them , it would be necessary for Egypt and Egyptians , to submit information on their identity , to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known so far that such plans consist .
experts and experts are sk@@ ep@@ tical about the technical feasi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Information &quot; ) of the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egypt Initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
&quot; I doubt strongly in the technical capacities , and the understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology . &quot;
&quot; according to my opinion , it is so noticeable that the same as they were able to control physical public and private spaces as well as it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , then it means that they are a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a judicial process . &quot;
&quot; this is technically not real@@ ist@@ ically realistic , but in Egypt everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s Legisl@@ ative Council and the Constitutional Committ@@ ees , before it goes to the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and en@@ forcement will be successful or not , the draft , &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military monument in parliament , where the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no other ob@@ servers are present on the surface area , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill of legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence was found for those who were found guilty to thre@@ aten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;

&quot; high above in the mountains of Kurdistan &apos;s mountains in the northeast of Iraq , the H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organisation established Iraq in order to protect the bel@@ gian Persian leop@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of the Leop@@ ards , which runs through Africa and Asia , are among the Persian leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . overall , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , such as the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered because of Wil@@ derness , loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat . &quot;
why is this specific type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza in the video shows , &quot; is the Persian leop@@ ard the only remaining pre@@ dat@@ or in the Kurdish ecos@@ ystem &quot; and health and the growth of the ecos@@ ystem also depends on that a big pre@@ dat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian leop@@ ards actually is small and goes against zero . as the team therefore noted that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , R@@ aza breaks into pure joy . &quot;
&quot; a trained biolog@@ ist shows R@@ aza , passionate about another side of their country , which consists of war and conflict . &quot;
it has been involved in the wild animals and training programs of Nature Iraq for six years now .
&quot; since 2013 , she has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and assumes that protection zones are set up for wildlife in the Kurdistan region . &quot;

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ based daily Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o , the progress made in the past six years have been affected by the life of those who had been affected by the &quot; three @-@ fold disaster &quot; of March 2011 . an enormous earthquake , a tsun@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ fecture was a certain pre@@ f@@ ect in Japan &apos;s Nor@@ theast , who had to experience the earthquake and the resulting tsun@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbourhood cultures Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to be evacu@@ ated because the tsun@@ ami had to disappear from the map .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima Pre@@ fecture still experienced a nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in fact alone 160 000 inhabitants have had to leave their homes . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o group shows a local point of view which resulted in progress for six years later to re@@ building the lives of local communities .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics from the Japanese re@@ building site as well as pol@@ l results of the affected themselves .
&quot; housing situation in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that in December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of planned spare @-@ houses ( formerly known as , im@@ plant , sa@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fec@@ tures Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , which was the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , were completed by 80 percent of the planned spare @-@ houses . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses while Fu@@ kus@@ hima , with 70 percent , is the final light . &quot;
&quot; even six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ated of Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ines ( formerly known as , Kaz@@ an su ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) is to be re@@ located in final spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after the triple @-@ cat@@ astro@@ phy , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in house@@ keeping . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , more than 36 000 people lived in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i had been more successful . more than 75 per cent of the evacu@@ ated revenues were displaced after the disaster in accommodation shel@@ ters . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the figure is 34 percent .
the stand of works and daily life in the three countries of the pre@@ fec@@ tures
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Zeitung could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools have been affected by the mis@@ fortune , its doors are open up to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , the industrial reconstruction is far more difficult in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; while nearly 100 percent of fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , in Fu@@ kus@@ hima , only 30 percent of fishing ports are resum@@ ed . &quot;
tsun@@ ami and nuclear accident have taken place in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land .
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i could re@@ produce 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 per cent of the ar@@ able land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that it is only a consequence of the atomic fact that only 690 hectares of 5 hectares destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in the nuclear zone of nuclear zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered well , but also Fu@@ kus@@ hima goes far away . &quot;
&quot; tourist arrivals in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent in the same stand as before the mis@@ fortune . Fu@@ kus@@ hima , however , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that since the catastrophe almost half of the coastal inhabitants , it is more difficult to find their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine a total image , the newspaper led numerous surveys under the native population and the evacu@@ ated by . she asked them about the state of reconstruction and also , as you find Emp@@ orium compared to the tsun@@ ami risk . &quot;
in her introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper declares :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o led a survey to bring more about the tsun@@ ami consciousness under the native population of experience .
&quot; the survey carried out that 8@@ 3.1 percent of the population resident , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and tsun@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respondents find that still not enough for cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention was done . &quot;
&quot; it is all about those who have evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture , &quot;
&quot; in her issue for the anniversary of the earthquake , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has strengthened its attention also on the situation of the evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the tremendous earthquake and devastating tsun@@ ami , no , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture was also a witness of the worst , cat@@ astro@@ phic accident , nuclear accident , Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were laid in areas outside the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were over 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , had been res@@ ett@@ led in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; after 2017 , still 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live outside their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ phic areas , most of the evacu@@ ated people are still more than 50 years old . you will be able to compete in proper comfort because the efforts are competing for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hima . this is about construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will be part in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our po@@ d@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries , which speak a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the simil@@ ar@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one recogni@@ zes that one appears more than it appears at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our pre@@ judi@@ ces , extending our perspectives and remember that the world ultimately is very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices of Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we will deal with topics that often get less attention than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders . &quot;
Ver@@ on@@ iki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ ar@@ ities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i Eg@@ her@@ man explained how love for music worked in rural culture ; Viol@@ eta M@@ aci@@ as speaks about the time when they worked with people out of all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back to his experiences that he collected in a small village in Madagascar .

&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to intensive care station at the age of 33 : last Friday , a police officer fought against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skul@@ ls of brain trau@@ ma and several fra@@ ctions . &quot;
physicians operated it on this Saturday and then translated it into a artificial coma .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local photo journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus who spread quickly in Brazil within a few days .
the pictures also identified the face of the police officer . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended until the conclusion of the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer as he proposes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with its striking position on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ reira ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; would a police officer accused of a protest@@ ers and take on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the whole repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ne@@ ali@@ z@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , who is attacked by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z , in which one sees how Mat@@ eus was attacked by the police officers and several sanitary shortly after him . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but from another perspective , is also di@@ pped in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the shown below , one sees the attack on Mat@@ eus down from the 50th second . &quot;
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users now donated 10.000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( roughly 2,@@ 700 Euro ) to discover a part of the cost of medical treatment and allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in the hospital . &quot;

Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil where it came to brutal police forces on Friday last Friday .
&quot; polic@@ emen sat at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where protest@@ ers had built a stage for speakers , g@@ ums and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the member of Fl@@ avi@@ o Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( PS@@ OL ) asked the police to refra@@ in against protest@@ ers against protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media prot@@ agonist wash@@ es by pointing out the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a window s@@ worn . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted about a broken glass window in order to illustr@@ ate a picture of their cover pages .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a sh@@ atter@@ ed bus . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window , than the protests of thousands of people who serve the defense of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary to recognize , if one is stri@@ ving against any form of damage . &quot;

the villages of forgotten villages in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ var@@ o Re@@ yn@@ oso , nearly hundreds of sugar products included in Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a ) &quot;
&quot; the municipality of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the Western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central in Spanish sugar mill - known , regardless of what there is no notable sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities in the sugar @-@ mol@@ ded factories were lame .
&quot; after the decline , the sugar cane sugar industry stood still in the region , and the factory lost gradually and after its plants , until only the sc@@ aff@@ old of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
approximately 272 workers had to inv@@ ent themselves .
some changed the work .
&quot; other re@@ signed and comm@@ ute daily to the factories , which are still grinding . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a Sol@@ data veter@@ an , who is open every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar industry does not smoke its sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that in the east of the region of sugar derivatives , which are returned after a long in@@ active time , because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expected .
&quot; it reminds us that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i would get the sugar cane factory , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already with@@ stands the case , the case of socialism , the low market prices , the poor efficiency , the poor administration decisions , and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the 1910 amount . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country some decades ago , but the bad harvest are already no re@@ leg@@ ality anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway platform of the church saw a better time .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
the processing of the sugar cane in the sugar industry was an economic necessity : the 155 cane mills were technically ob@@ sol@@ ete and hardly any competitive for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories left to produce sugar for the most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
&quot; the moti@@ ves , which led to such measures , were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the global market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the type of sugar rose again for about a decade . &quot;
&quot; between 2017 and 2025 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Economic and Food organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar @-@ export would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will go with security in history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of re@@ structure began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , a total number of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened at the Sug@@ ro@@ hr@@ ub Gregori@@ o Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; if N@@ ene , as a soldier , is known about the closure of the factory , is the word that He has repeated the most , &quot; Sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
&quot; almost all respondents are in the same opinion , not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down . &quot;
&quot; in order to receive the place , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
the first letters began to come in front of the first year .
&quot; it was officially licensed to the documents , which would be removed only concerning the parts that would be removed , the add@@ sat and the date distinguished . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility took over and the letters were still more common . &quot;
Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory for two years and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money to operate in operation .
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waits for retirement in another plant that Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in front of the factory , in whose construction he helped , was involved . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dismant@@ led one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and most important workplace producers was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases there were no alternatives for working positions and services such as plants in the communities , in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mamm@@ ut speech of 21 October 2002 , the then president in the eyes of the present persons saw when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories not work in operation for five years , everything was well running . &quot;
the price of the population for closure of sugar derivatives
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane is extracted only high by M@@ ays . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ atist@@ a )
&quot; after two years , the national congregation of Gregori@@ o Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich studied that many things change , but not always to the better when a factory was closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory was closed , or better said they began to de@@ duct them , they also listened to as@@ ure the road , and also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look up other factories . &quot;
they were to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people left the region too . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene came back to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
nin@@ ety and forty years of old soldiers bring a retirement of two thousand Pes@@ o per month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ i .
&quot; Lord N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear@@ er voice , is not a down@@ ward person , yet he gives the lies that one told him not . &quot;
they pe@@ eling him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene goes back to retirement age of 65 , not because it is missing in force , but because it is bitter@@ ness . &quot;

&quot; the original workshops were led by the ped@@ agog@@ ues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North @-@ Quebec with ten cre@@ ams and then worked with the Cre@@ e Hip Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will thus increasing the young participants in our conversations , such as &quot; cultural identity , language , meditation , love , self @-@ acceptable &quot; or whatever they will find in mind . &quot;
&quot; these questions are inspiration for songs and videos , in which the young people are the main actors . &quot;
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ neb@@ ago in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , even &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were generally not cleared .
&quot; the next video of the Nem@@ o Cre@@ e First nation uses the motive of a video game to mediate , as important to the preser@@ vation of traditional customs and customs , despite the influences of glob@@ alisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in Indian languages , although the young people are not always able to control the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation , the chor@@ us is sung in Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young@@ sters provided some help from Gary J@@ olly from the North@@ stars hip hop group , who gave them a verse in dial@@ ect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; at the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in the heading , as well as translation into English , which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel when nobody ever interested in me ?
&quot; but I &apos;m trying to walk further my days on earth , &quot;
&quot; that is the day , in which you will take our cry &quot;
because we have lost our way in life
&quot; but I believe that we will rise up a day , &quot;
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; so , they can grow and wear our youth . &quot;
&quot; thus , they can do that , what is the creator for the Creator ? &quot;
&quot; in the commentary part , the reader and supporters of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in Sil@@ ver@@ signature ( which is also published on his blog , and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , are located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ hin @-@ pur@@ u ( formerly known as &quot; &quot; Plast@@ ics models of the dishes &quot; ) of every food that is served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they can enter or continue the restaurant .
there is an entire industry dedicated to producing these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , there are a variety of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes which the German filmmaker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; most Japanese are so ordinary for most Japanese , so they do not even realize them . a new trend , however , turns them today in current mobile @-@ cell accessories and other g@@ ad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the Blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos depicting this unusual Twist using the sho@@ ku@@ hin san@@ it@@ u . &quot;
&quot; now in special sale : new with plastic dishes made of decorative mobile phones , as shown in the ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji to@@ y@@ u department store . &quot;
&quot; many of these artificial foods have been transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection , as in this case , refriger@@ ator@@ mag@@ nets : &quot;
here are some sho@@ ku@@ hin refriger@@ ator@@ i mag@@ nets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of the essence is increasingly consuming .
in this case an ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular rice bowl with seafood ) is transformed into a mobile phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as cell phone support .
we have also made this part for the Tokyo exhibition in Tokyo .
and here is an apple holding your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing flight into the compass .
some mobile phone support and cell phone designer allow you to create your own work of art . in this case ik@@ ura or Lach@@ s@@ che@@ ated is a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice .
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there anybody who would say : &quot; Wow , cool , now I can decor@@ ate my mobile phone with salmon ? &quot;
I think I will probably be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also be a less appe@@ ti@@ zing form , to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasant . &quot;
our latest mobile phone support has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; moreover , there are also travel balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , earrings and hand@@ pieces of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for further com@@ r@@ ile plastic dishes can be found under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag # , the , and the h@@ ash@@ tag # , &quot;
&quot; if you like to learn more about the origin of this trends , you &apos;ll find an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi District , which is devoted to the popular restaurant industry , such as the sho@@ ku@@ hin sandy . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes can be made .
a Mexican project tells stories of the survivors of the fight against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against the drug dealers . &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug traff@@ icking , &quot; in Mexico , the mi@@ sts and ge@@ aring regularly emerge only in statistics . however , these reflect not the extent of the human tragedy that this battle is bringing together . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses , such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ on , pressed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , anyone looks at the mourning or to the communities who have learned to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind every bone structure in the hundreds of heated graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never heal . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal , animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; learning to live a voice ) and tells stories about people who were in the fight between prosec@@ utions and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project as follows :
organized crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much deeper .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug retailers and all communities have to travel for many kilometres to buy something like milk . &quot;
the Pain of Vic@@ tims
a video showing the title &quot; Vi@@ das que cam@@ bian p@@ or el m@@ ie@@ do &quot; ( German : &quot; like fear of life &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guad@@ alu@@ pe , a father , who is seeking secret tom@@ bs according to his son . &quot;
&quot; or Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost their father for only one day , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two her ne@@ phe@@ w . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ est : &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing to get rid of us today and to the graves we are loved to search for the people who loved us . &quot;
Guad@@ alu@@ pe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric store in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never returned . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very hard for me , because I am now alone with three children who need an apprentices@@ hip . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is also with me here . &quot;
at the moment it has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but she does not pay them out because they demand a dying man . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r con el nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we don &apos;t just need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility , and the stat@@ ute . &quot;
the project is based on stories by readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ HB , a reader of animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in Central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your post reminds us that you should never consider violence as normal , no matter in which form it occurs : &quot;
I know about illness and sens@@ ory journ@@ alism now for some years .
I arrive at newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the cover pages with pictures which can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from acquis@@ itions of specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel , as if I am the only thing I am concerned or sad . it works , like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be considered normal or normal .
she continues her :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cousin wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) if it &apos;s big . and it &apos;s not normal that people talk about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is , as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they are so something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories to naked numbers are in a statistic .
&quot; the in@@ action of human beings is incredible for me , if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified to be justified . &quot;
&quot; I think they are trying to talk about such trage@@ dies , if they don &apos;t touch and still remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution &quot; Four months of compres@@ sing at the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed for month &apos;s money from their business , until they were not only destroyed by the end , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you lost and remember how some people can completely change your entire life in just a few days .
&quot; pain never passes away , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear is coming up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers as well . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are removed from each other , the better . &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they &apos;re going to kill or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days , whether weeping would dissolve my deep feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to weep . I have to learn how to live with pain . &quot;
&quot; the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one of the most distinguished generation . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions on how : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was killed by organised crime ? &quot;
what is it possible to grow in a settlement on the ver@@ ge of the most dangerous city of Mex@@ ic@@ os ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents take care of them . &quot;
&quot; Bryan is a Wa@@ ise and he tells that he himself had to teach himself how to make an egg , potatoes , tortillas , tortillas warm and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for babies who live with him . this is his name for the preparation of fl@@ acon with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
&quot; they are in@@ significant , compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ able for a boy for the whole life of violence , and who had to learn to live with it . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he said to him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was already over two years earlier , when he was only a few blocks away from his home , the bloody dead body of his father , who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Bryan was born , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Bryan was born in 2006 , as a violence by organised crime and struggle against the already existing social issues in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the civil security and government of the United States government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosecutor called 3@@ 103 murders . this corresponds to average 8,5 murders per day . &quot;
&quot; these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories , which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penet@@ rate the country &apos;s soul . &quot;
few stories still live in view of new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ er@@ a Vi@@ vi@@ r Con El Nar@@ co , &quot; animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico is established in 2015 , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the drug traff@@ icking , which has failed to represent the country in the past four decades in comprehen@@ sible ways . &quot;
&quot; if a picture is worth a thousand in@@ true words , &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ ing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Fli@@ ck@@ r @-@ users Ni@@ kl@@ as Viking ( CC @-@ BY @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this article and the pages where he links , include pictures , on which violence is represented . &quot;
&quot; the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to raise or un@@ mask a fake . &quot;
&quot; but how is the years after the first time immer@@ sed ? content in social media , no matter whether true or un@@ true , incl@@ ined to pass . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident in the Democratic Republic of Congo seven years ago ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been fully exploited and used trage@@ dies that have taken place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of image and event - &quot; wrong description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the termin@@ ology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - Do not deny the fact that there are abundant reporting on events in the DRC , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank paved the place S@@ ange at the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ pp@@ te around and explo@@ ded . 230 people came in . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country has been negle@@ cted and devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become too dangerous peac@@ ekeeping , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
trag@@ ically , the tank fell victim to the victim . &quot;
&quot; representatives critic@@ ises a fire@@ ball , the dozens of houses including a movie in the vicinity , which was full of people that illustr@@ ate the soccer World Cup . &quot;
&quot; the houses were hol@@ lowed , and twi@@ sted cor@@ p@@ ses were scattered in the streets . &quot;
many people were burned to ignor@@ ance .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; That is Nigeria &quot; . from Im@@ g@@ ur users Myst@@ ical Monkey , 12 January 201@@ 5. more photos of the incident make the grey scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
&quot; it displays rows of carbon@@ ated body , lying on the floor , while they have a look . &quot;
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; the same photo was raised several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real @-@ term trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar in particular . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar ?
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the ent@@ an@@ ted Nig@@ erian village Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
witnesses reported dra@@ stically of atro@@ cities before they flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and car@@ cases were burned in streets and bus@@ hes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; no one remained behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many were crushed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only using satellite images , the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ explained , but the army &apos;s point in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt of B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture taken back from the DRC again , as soon as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ concep@@ tual use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of fail@@ ures ; Africa Check has been documented in Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as a proof for measures . &quot;
a step further on personal comments such as this example crash the image from the DRC with sources of mass media in connection to provide arguments .
the picture from S@@ ange also occurred in conjunction with the deadly persecution of Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a flash statement , published by the United Nations , those who escaped could escape blo@@ ws , rape and some dead , some through burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts reported as the following , which brought these descriptions with photos from the DRC : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ al Arabian news site , which was fal@@ sely alleged that President My@@ an@@ m@@ ars Th@@ an has said to have been involved in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition she had used the image from the DRC to illustr@@ ate this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , which called AFP as their source , had failed Th@@ an His own testimony , but had not taken the picture from the DRC in connection . &quot;
&quot; the wide range of false data , &quot;
tracks of this wrong c@@ rank@@ ings go back to the years 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere in all over the world .
using a &quot; reverse image search &quot; you can see how far more details can exceed borders .
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found out of 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of May 3 , 2017 ) 344 pictures , which are very similar to the mentioned picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have attempted to un@@ mask the counter@@ f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; we have bor@@ dered examples of ab@@ used use and brought them in connection with the respective countries , based on which page they were published . thus , we want to display the range more clearly than the language alone . &quot;
several examples of mis@@ use are used in the listed countries ( which were also associated with each other in some cases ) .
here are some cases that can now be felt completely up ( on the map in orange ) :

&quot; as the picture later , in connection with the massacre of the B@@ oko Har@@ am of 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to ref@@ ute that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ Ä±@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ or@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria comes to sleep the world ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo first appeared , provided with this t@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , and dissolved a discussion in Muslims after the massacres of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and at Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities had taken these events , which took place in the name of the Islam@@ s , a larger attention . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
the picture was we@@ ath@@ ered as a proof for the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times ret@@ we@@ ds ) . but the messages that were associated with that were taken up in no religious context .
&quot; instead , the aim was to raise attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media coverage in comparison of Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message that supposedly had been written by a &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ erian massacre , it fell into circulation as this was shown here on Vietnamese and declared it to the Counter@@ feit . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the picture was included in the DRC , the organization of the Clar@@ et@@ iner Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of a faulty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; the Tin@@ Eye can also be tra@@ ce@@ able to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and pages in the following countries ( the portfolio in grey ) , but are not fully tra@@ ce@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and perhaps China . &quot;
&quot; ( data entries with UR@@ Ls and time / date stamp exist on the web cra@@ wler and to be isolated , they have access to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . ) &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident in 2010 , the image can ultimately correct a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or appro@@ ach@@ able . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong themes or frames ( frame ) that go through this posts . the first frame is focused on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to larger discussions on the silence of Muslims in the context of Muslims or - to defend the Muslims - the Muslims of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as through Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; understanding religion , and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worthwhile to investigate how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer give this pictures longer . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are nin@@ ety people who are un@@ intended to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ars this mood of mal@@ icious and fal@@ cons , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true , and did the real horror of what actually happened in the DR Congo , in Nigeria and in Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of non@@ violent pictures has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
an argument is that the back of images resulting from a ref@@ us@@ al to recognise the tragedy . sometimes these pictures are even demanded by the victims themselves .
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent pictures and audience des@@ en@@ si@@ zing and gave them the ability to emp@@ athy emp@@ athy ( such as this study , investig@@ ating how violent media to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some more violent represent@@ ations in the media media , fact is fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news coverage . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologists have experim@@ enting with algorith@@ ms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; in which a picture can be certain , in which a picture can be certain , however , which may also be replaced by the context or at completely mis@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; each examination of false ass@@ essments , however , should also be considered internationally as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages

&quot; a blog with the name of Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . un@@ mistak@@ able ) endeav@@ oring to offer language enth@@ used a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to be translated . &quot;
&quot; such words are in any language : they express certain situations or feelings , which are often very complex or specific . &quot;
some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known ( like the famous Portuguese Sau@@ da@@ de ) and others who are ro@@ oted in a specific culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ slow@@ esa ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of an easy translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not sufficient , that is why a full explanation and sometimes something context is necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for a long time in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , during the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find words from V@@ anu@@ at@@ u &apos;s VAT language , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - En@@ try your parents in recognition how to stri@@ ve for yourself in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language , which are spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi - The convenience or sl@@ oth that you feel after getting caught in cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog about :
&quot; they grin@@ ders other cultures , reveal other thoughts and wake our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists in this page , and show more of these &quot; un@@ mistak@@ able &quot; words , show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treasure Languages , &quot; very much appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

&quot; like Sri Lanka , with the worst flood catastrophe of the decade &quot;
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently the worst floo@@ ding and land@@ slides in this decade .
&quot; the mon@@ soon triggered by the mon@@ soon which usually collapsed in late May , rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and Att@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; according to a statement by the cat@@ astro@@ phy of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and just under hundreds of people are missed due to the floods and slaugh@@ tering . &quot;
&quot; over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and approximately 100 000 people have been associated with 304 secure residence . &quot;
&quot; the rain@@ falls left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the waterfalls in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene interest of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still un@@ appro@@ ach@@ able areas .
the following pictures and videos con@@ vey an impression of the extent of the flood catastrophe :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water volumes up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to the high water conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # Flo@@ od@@ SL to monitor the extent of the catastrophe .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly sins wor@@ sen the think@@ ers crisis , save the Children , after further rainfall are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa bus stop in the floods , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle is also flooded due to the last survi@@ ving water p@@ eg@@ s of the Mor@@ og@@ o@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five planes for rescue operations and five are made for transport of emergency supplies for the residents in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and start@@ ups have also made ready to help .
Facebook pages such as Help Flo@@ od V@@ ICT@@ I@@ MS in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on high water conditions and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams are required for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 44@@ 6@@ 39 . &quot;
to don@@ ate dry foods and food @-@ needed goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ en@@ i@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals in this field need help .
&quot; the taxi @-@ created app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their site data with the help of the app , so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ Centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the trop@@ enst@@ ur@@ ms Ro@@ anu , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood relief &quot; &quot; button , allowing users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up and donations . these were then for@@ warded to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; as well , they led to a &quot; SOS &quot; key which included more than thousand requests and 150 successful bo@@ ret@@ inal activities for the result of floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , residents in need of security and make help of aid . &quot;
this has prevented the loss of further human lives whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore the norm@@ ality .

&quot; the Women &apos;s March 9th , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ ib G@@ ha@@ zi .
use approved . Dam@@ as in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbor and a dear friend .
&quot; I trusted her my four year old daughter , familiar to me her children ; she is my rock in the bran@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we still call Par@@ gan@@ s for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are located in a sea of umbre@@ llas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head scarf , bound from an American flag , other channels of slo@@ gan@@ s against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; these things don &apos;t concern yourself , right ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already led these activities .
&quot; people , with whom I am working or people who have met me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar which they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in her conception . &quot;
they det@@ oxi@@ fy me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion different .
we identify us to be a Muslim on different kind of art . but somehow we are all put in the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is designed in our collective not@@ ion that as soon as Muslims , which , as I don &apos;t fit there , can be susp@@ icious . &quot;
to be dra@@ fted
I don &apos;t get this alone .
this is even the poet that poetry is best selling in America : Rum@@ i .
which pictures are one in the sense when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ al@@ ud@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I &apos;m now , he was an orthodo@@ xer Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western introduction , religion was deleted from Rum@@ is , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims in this world .
&quot; another consists in the reduction images of Muslims , that the Western books have been colonial for centuries . &quot;
&quot; this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man that you should fear , and the exotic woman you should save . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian scientist Edward Said performed its history behind these pictures . &quot;
but these images also stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood them continue . &quot;
&quot; I have worked for thirteen years in the news industry and I saw , as this powerful , defective narr@@ ative that domin@@ ate our news feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narr@@ ative overs@@ ha@@ dow the reality that have led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the USA will not even choose their first female presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; this narr@@ ative fails to recognize that if French , Muslim women will be hin@@ dered to wear their head@@ scarf in public buildings and acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women by their government to cover their entire body , which both sides are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercises his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; this strong narr@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women , stimul@@ ating movements for change . &quot;
&quot; it looks , that the first Muslim prayers were spoken at the African soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this Nar@@ r@@ ative has occupied our collective pre@@ fabri@@ cation force , deeply and er@@ ron@@ eous that often S@@ ik@@ h men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ milit@@ ant attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and due to the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of another . &quot;
the 1.7 billion belong
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
&quot; we also create Nar@@ r@@ atives , helping us understand the world . &quot;
&quot; and in this way , my industry has never failed to capture the sc@@ r@@ ative of the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; and we failed to have failed , where seven million Muslims comprise the highest degree &quot; various &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than one @-@ third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ sto@@ cky Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims are among the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;

four decades ago my parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American super@@ st@@ ics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan post@@ pon@@ ed the world &apos;s Sky@@ lines in the world , my parents were un@@ disputed Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I in the Muslim and American woman now ?
&quot; sometimes people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork meat , I say - instead of getting out my Muslim recipes or get my hand@@ ker@@ chie@@ fs that are all Muslims with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ p@@ ah W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I am jo@@ king , we do not wear all T@@ ash@@ co@@ ols with us . &quot;
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; to be selected by almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim schol@@ ars , Muslim activists and religious activists who make an effort to fight far widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced in the current volume of a well @-@ decorated Islam@@ opho@@ bia with money @-@ makers , think tanks and experts for fal@@ cons , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and due to the species , in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia lies in more than just a strange woman , who ri@@ pped the head@@ scarf with a woman . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms attacks our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it uses our identity , which is so far reaching , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as the Muslim , but a Muslim was first born in my presence , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when Social scientists describe religious life , they attack the following terms : belief , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend would be my friend , my neighbor , my rock in the bran@@ ce that I am Muslim if they could separate through the 15 @-@ metre concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the everyday rit@@ ual with my daughter , if I kept her to my poor and her the Arab verses to protect the Koran and called the Q@@ s . &quot;
&quot; each of them , I repeat three times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I beg you , that they may be protected from evil , the evil one that can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be seen , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the image of my grandmother &apos;s maternal side with her sisters ; as she would win a competition of the art of floral arranged in Kar@@ achi before decades .
&quot; it &apos;s the picture of her that I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished paintings by Su@@ fi @-@ Saint ; and a basket with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost complete . &quot;
&quot; to be the Muslim , to speak the prayers that she told me , when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; to be the Muslim , as she taught me to refer to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who has been colonial for centuries - through a &quot; Imperi@@ um &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name of British East Fris@@ ia company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; affili@@ ation means to grow up and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my brother is crying . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , while he writes books about modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir@@ s , N@@ ana Ja@@ an ruled around his family in India , with K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he did not close to his arms in a half century . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ation is to know that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians who have been torn apart from colon@@ ists , including col@@ oni@@ alists , who have divided the Muslim world as at stake . &quot;
&quot; to be aware that in the last two centuries , Europeans have been colon@@ ised all to four Muslim countries . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it means to know , that the first fli@@ ppers of the history was thrown off over a Muslim country in front of a century . &quot;
&quot; it means that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , k@@ ins@@ ane sub@@ jection of the British Empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; as it was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world when I ever had ever been and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go back to our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ plug@@ ged story .
&quot; it is recall that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops which had been distributed over any continent except from Antar@@ c@@ tica , were spread to Iraq in order to pursue mass destruction of weapons who did not exist . &quot;
it means that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
&quot; an American Muslim , to know , means that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that if a tragedy is home to the US , and the susp@@ ects bears a Muslim name , which tells the story four times more than a history with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that four hundred years ago , the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was proclaimed by a free black slaves with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means that two hundred years ago , an African Islam@@ ist named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought to this country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X to call an American hero .
it is warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against Muslim Ban .
&quot; it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams , and when we say black life . &quot;
&quot; an American woman to be a Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ erin , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Punj@@ abi , a Muslim and a journalist means that inher@@ ent inter@@ sec@@ tional inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our with multiple conne@@ c@@ tiv@@ al ident@@ ities , but to fail to communicate them on others . &quot;
&quot; the narr@@ ative of the 1.7 billion is more possibilities than a magic cubes , but is represented in the reduced branch &quot; &quot; we &quot; &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother , to take care of my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged persons to establish structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia consists in the Muslim regi@@ stran@@ ts that began with President Bush and were under President Obama under President Obama .
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in immigration , who takes five years old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
&quot; it consists in a country , which includes its borders against people from just the countries that it bom@@ bed . &quot;
it &apos;s a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; No @-@ Fly @-@ list &quot; which largely accepts Arab and Muslims .
&quot; there are the wars that we lead , and the bombs that we throw on Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , researchers of North@@ western University researchers showed a scientific in@@ correct picture and asked them to assess groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the least scores .
the conversation we have to lead
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to reveal the Muslim , or the &quot; &quot; others &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades , the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous image print@@ outs that we ate in our news re@@ productions . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry that attempts to capture our multiple ident@@ ities and forgotten history . &quot;

&quot; but I am worried because of this difficult global time point , in which we are located . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go out over 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for the con@@ spir@@ ing theore@@ ti@@ cian that existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
they have grown exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims to &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; another group , which has been exp@@ on@@ enti@@ ally grown , has grown by the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
a few years earlier it had not yet been given ; now they rule out large areas in Syria and Iraq .
&quot; I am concerned about real@@ ities and the story that I was not aware of , as I was so old now , as it is now my daughter , but those who have made me an in@@ um@@ erable Muslim . &quot;
things I have left here like a bread cr@@ ater track in my speech .
&quot; things you might wake up memories , because in all the inter@@ sec@@ tions that make our humanity may listen to a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversation at the 8th Annual Conference to Islam@@ opho@@ bia are held . &quot;

&quot; we must imagine un@@ comfortable questions after the role of his , consci@@ ously and un@@ consci@@ ously the &quot; other &quot; to mis@@ chief ; as it is my girlfriend and I have seen a new future in which we have no pre@@ sidents , the chocolate cake as already broken &quot; &quot; people &quot; &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .

can there be a possibility here and now in spite of a language barrier with someone in connection ?
&quot; Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , is a possible answer to stories in their original language . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices told short about another initiative by Steven Bird , the Un@@ mistak@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; but here , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language of big cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has already carried out events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not given to the children born there . &quot;
to the M@@ acher &apos;s M@@ acher project :
&quot; the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities , accept diversity - safe spaces , in which residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are . &quot;
&quot; while listening is often associated to understand &quot; &quot; these events instead &quot; &quot; listen to appreciate , to make , to link . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their de@@ vot@@ ion and their representation make sure the audience leadership can make it . &quot;
&quot; they call laughter and emotions , when the language is no longer a barrier . &quot;
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional history of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round , the story of the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ d@@ ou will also take the opportunity to explain typical of stories for their country . &quot;
in another event John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the F@@ able of the rab@@ bits and the Pa@@ vian in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe :
&quot; after he explained the meaning of his message , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is that to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in , he tells his feeling of exclu@@ si@@ vity : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of the Treasure Language Stor@@ yt@@ elling took place in three cities and organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all those who are inspired by the project can make T@@ LS in contact to organize their own story stor@@ yt@@ elling . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls on the United States Re@@ fest@@ ation of sovereign debt
&quot; the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars participated last April 3 , 2017 , various religious and bourgeois organizations at a mass demonstration ; the march started at the pu@@ rest Capit@@ ol , the capital city of the capital , and went to the Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fr@@ ente Ci@@ u@@ da@@ d@@ ano p@@ or la Audit@@ or@@ Ã­a de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( the front for the neur@@ on of debt ) and the Ec@@ ological Church of Puerto Rico . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the inter@@ c@@ cess@@ ation of the debt of debt have also submitted a pet@@ ition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States . &quot;
this is their requirement :
&quot; the people Puerto Ric@@ os calls for the politicians , banks and government agencies that are responsible for debt , for their corruption and corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial examination and a tap committee without personal interests in public debt , with a firm , our working conditions corresponding to the business . &quot;
we will be pres@@ supp@@ ressed and supp@@ ressed .
Puerto Rico people ref@@ uses to pay a debt that is not thei@@ rs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pension@@ ers will not be found with sin@@ king Rent@@ als .
we demand instant action .
the island - not in the United States of the United States - suffers from a heavy financial crisis .
&quot; hence , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; an non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with focus on soci@@ o@@ economic development , a law for state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis Puerto Ric@@ os requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; the measures imposed on the outside , without the participation and conviction of the citizens are danger to be rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian Palestinian Web developer Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missed since one year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives have continued the campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions which he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : PU@@ BL@@ ICA , the annual conference held for digital culture that will be held in Berlin , dedicated a event to the # Free@@ bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the UK @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara RÃ¼@@ hl@@ ing , Managing Director of book Cost of Freedom : a Colle@@ ctive In@@ ner ( The Cost of Freedom : a collective research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and licensed here , contains a number of sets containing free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is an homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it means :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge and what the real costs are , with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge have been working on site to check out our news feeds and to create something from our different experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteers , which has been detained in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was kn@@ itted by the A@@ dra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his present state or position . &quot;
&quot; the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Colle@@ ctive memory gives his friends and his family a voice that trouble on his release , and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; to see how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us will let us start thinking about their own fate , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what have we decided for ?
&quot; in this process , what have we abandoned in this process of temp@@ oral beliefs ? &quot;
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital activist has been detained in the Syrian government agencies since March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution which was transferred to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police bases on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; initiated by the military tribunal of his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she had been cont@@ acted by persons on November 12 , 2015 , who presented themselves as a insi@@ der of the Assad government and put it in knowledge by an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
his residence and condition remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel has played a crucial role in expl@@ aining the Internet and knowledge to the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently transferred the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel writes on the sides 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bass@@ els &apos;s cultural prototypes are looking forward to work with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually recon@@ struct ancient ruins of Pal@@ m@@ yr@@ as .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ wise of numerous ci@@ vil@@ is@@ ations and here mer@@ ging Greek @-@ Roman architectural types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel could not know that ten years after he started working with this work , the IS would put all this architecture that would not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
this stamp in the digital archae@@ ology and the preser@@ vation has created a time capsule which will be inv@@ alu@@ able for the public as well as scientists and artists in the future of inv@@ alu@@ able .
trag@@ ically , Bas@@ sel could not complete this project yet . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ ha@@ zi , also contributed to the book , writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life to dream of freedom , and Bash@@ an taught me to embrace her . &quot;
&quot; I was overwhel@@ med , when I call his name . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ sel made me English , even when he was already in prison . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English . &quot;
&quot; he always has his knowledge with everyone who asked him . he taught others to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened the gate to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smart phones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught others to others , as they use computer , at least in theory , without knowing they actually held one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( waiting ) , a trial that she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 when he was in prison . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ our@@ a worked together on the book a year .
she sm@@ ug@@ gled the lyrics to him when she visited him and translated it to English from Arabic to English .

Bass@@ els &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the 2011 protests against the Bashar al @-@ Assad regime , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) , more than 6@@ 5.000 people have disappeared . &quot;
those who were arrested or executed under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians in jail since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of bas@@ sel since 2012 .
we repeat our demand today in hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption and convicted director after dis@@ miss@@ al release again
&quot; the Mos@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with anger on a corruption case , in which a government member returned to the workplace after half of his sentence , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ b@@ aza , who was arrested in 2008 and arrested in 2010 , together with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 , with four other def@@ endants were sentenced to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , the Council of Cam@@ b@@ aza between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was released in 2016 because of good leadership and called for immediate restoration of the company , which took place on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the General Prosecutor of the Republic which provided the application , there would be no obst@@ acle for Cam@@ b@@ aza , to obtain his old post again , because the company had no disciplines after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not give the action good . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution dedicated to public transparency , condemned in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the decision of the company to address the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the absence of transparency and is even a reg@@ ression regarding the efforts of our legal system , such as C@@ IP . &quot;
&quot; what we have to know , that the company should also have a disciplines of disciplines against the conc@@ essions . &quot;
&quot; however , the company seems to do not set appropriate legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Mozambique social media , re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; contradic@@ tory &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ b@@ aza had a competent guy , he would be counsel@@ ors after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of them had to eat . &quot;
he could maintain lectures and motiv@@ ating speech@@ es he could advise and pol@@ ishing his image .
&quot; but as he is in@@ competent , he has tried to re@@ integrate into the company , which he helped inf@@ lic@@ t damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ b@@ aza will gladly pay for his silence .
resi@@ sted !
&quot; bit@@ ing Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ ans , and Student of Political Sciences in Brazil says the director of no mor@@ ality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza was rewarded by the State because he was ins@@ ulting him , I can &apos;t believe someone who has already rewarded the state so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza do not need to return to mor@@ als and to serve the state , * he had already served a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead , only served by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ b@@ aza used the state , as a hand to become an in@@ exhau@@ stible money source and the State itself has become we@@ ary of this man , the pre @-@ charged and finally sentenced to a long sentence . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I do not know why this man has been rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te fav@@ oured to remind the prime minister of Mos@@ ambi@@ k , Sam@@ ora F@@ el , to remember that a thief is heard in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ ie@@ ves belong to Sam@@ ora F@@ el &apos;s prison will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as a sharp , inter@@ sec@@ ession and - by the way - prophe@@ tically red@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral represent@@ ations , when he was energetic , that &quot; an ambitious man was able to sell , even the father@@ land for its amb@@ itions that sell his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes the tac@@ tics , but he does not change his amb@@ itions . &quot;
an ambitious human being criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , reactions were also opposed : &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cen@@ sored many users to wrong
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pairs &quot; means chick@@ pe@@ as or b@@ aff@@ old .

&quot; according to data from Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because it contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although more than the origin of the word is still discussed , it will usually be used to refer to people East Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ jective &quot; indi@@ an . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cen@@ sored by the word &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; or , &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar , &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the ascent of radical nation@@ alist movements have given an extremely decreasing con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nation@@ alists than hate crimes against Muslims which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to tackle hate speech in Myanmar , the company has licensed a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; today &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; may normally be associated with rac@@ ism , but the word of itself does not appear automatically . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; many people have reported that even Po@@ sts , in which they have discussed the use of the Word or expressed a doubt of his use , cen@@ sored . &quot;
&quot; in addition there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with fundamental differences , which have the same accounting sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair can be written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same characters as well as other words such as &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( age switch ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ at &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar@@ ka@@ ar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ nut@@ zer A@@ ung Ka@@ ach declared the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; :
&quot; a post of my friends was deleted today , because he contained the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; however , he asked his friends on a spiritual way whether she knew how he could relie@@ ve his back pain by doing a word game . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resem@@ bles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various responses to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in win @-@ win is the opinion that they are likely to decrease in tongues of radical nation@@ alists , however , also emphas@@ ized that Facebook must be analy@@ tic before it insi@@ sts out all the posts suspected in sus@@ pic@@ ion of rac@@ ism . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it automatically filters the word automatically .
automation is not understood what you are writing on fac@@ er@@ ook .
&quot; what it should do instead , is carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the following words . &quot;
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pairs . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these three nation@@ alists , hate speech , spread a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all of them that hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not be long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat demonstrated that the c@@ ens@@ orship is often called a cat@@ ch@@ - and mouse game , whereby the user will simply start to use social networks to express their views in order to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to extingu@@ ish his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; is ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a post to inform my Facebook friends that the word is blocked . &quot;
&quot; ir@@ on@@ ically , my post office was removed from Facebook and I was saying to the li@@ ken , post and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not answer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook has a variety of posts from people that have no negative int@@ entions , or who just try to show their opinions against the hate speech radic@@ ally nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post has been removed which has nothing to do with Hass@@ language :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion about why extreme nation@@ alism and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
Chan my@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more than the beginning of the initiative to ask for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community about advice :
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce rac@@ ism in Burma by their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
&quot; such words may be cen@@ sored , even more hatred will bring in the various communities . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have forbidden such words as &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; pe@@ sen@@ cur@@ ry . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they have made mistakes , they did not attempted to report the fal@@ si@@ fied po@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; if they only had more respect for the 15 million use , that would be a big turnover , would be great . &quot;
Fac@@ ebooks automatic c@@ ens@@ orship has given a lot of b@@ ass@@ oon among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now have fun and write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of Hass@@ language to see if their posts will be taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that failed to abst@@ ain from Hass@@ language , but still removed : &quot;

the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch as a pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
just to try out whether Facebook contains the post which contains the word Kal@@ ar .

&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious Fund@@ ament@@ alists who have used social networks have increased their voices and their influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks will pre@@ heat the violence in the municipalities in Myanmar , especially in Rak@@ h@@ ine area , where disp@@ utes between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook was crit@@ ici@@ zed for his failure to say that hate Hass@@ elt to his bur@@ mes@@ ian pages were crit@@ ici@@ zed .
&quot; but rather than listening to the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at context than on code concentrated initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end of the children
a wedding ring in sand .
&quot; photo of Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC BY 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s before is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanimously decided to offer a law to offer this practice , so that the marriage @-@ enabled age is now at 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of the year there were some members of Hin@@ doo and Muslim religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 , brother Har@@ ry@@ pers@@ ad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the religious groups of the country , said that the state should not inter@@ fere with the representatives of the various religious groups , as that , the age does not im@@ press the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened un@@ noticed by the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contra@@ ctual partner of the UN Children &apos;s prevention , the min@@ ors of less than 18 years &quot; defined . &quot;
&quot; for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 shows that the proportion of children who were married at 15 were already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 were 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s central office of the country confirmed that by 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married to 19 . &quot;
&quot; online pet@@ ition@@ ing and social media movements that were stri@@ ving to abol@@ ish the laws of child before , followed by the foot and enjoyed great support . without doubt , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , no everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; an Hin@@ du @-@ leader , for example , had no concerns to say the criticism of children before they should take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition campa@@ igned for vol@@ t@@ ages in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and sometime in some doubt , doubts whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against children before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( among them one woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and declare the law .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators offered a status update on Facebook , which was once again post@@ oper@@ able to Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ ag@@ ram : &quot;
&quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence R@@ amb@@ har@@ at : the bill of the bill was against her children before the House of Represent@@ atives , with 35 votes and not a single one decided against it . &quot;
&quot; after he had previously decided in the Senate , the design can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users was thr@@ illed because the laws had been changed for children before finally .
&quot; fac@@ ebook @-@ member of Lov@@ el Francis , which was commissioned by the Ministry of Education in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary g@@ ossi@@ p used to wear the core of the matter , but you know what ? the children &apos;s before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every prize . &quot;
&quot; while Abel was Jackson &apos;s opinion , I definitely took enough to do the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ al @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status Update on Facebook from L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ e - Thomas , which says : , Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the Eh@@ eg@@ es@@ etz has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which heard the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WIN@@ AD ) , a civil society which was right openly about how important the adoption of the law is noted : &quot;
the married age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the religious affili@@ ation for 18 years .
&quot; the draft on the change of marriage was approved today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Represent@@ atives , there are 41 members of it and 35 were present at the vote . &quot;
&quot; all members who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s before is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ mar@@ ri@@ age@@ is@@ ome .
many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
thanks to our M@@ EPs .
&quot; nevertheless , a possible hook comes in the form of satellite Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of San@@ atan D@@ har@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most well @-@ known Hin@@ du organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; prior to months , Mahar@@ aj has announced his intention to establish a judicial steps , the law should be adopted , and he seems to redeem his promise now . &quot;
&quot; during the General At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a supp@@ orter of the law said that it would be quite law@@ fully when Mahar@@ aj turned against the law , the most social media users , one would change the debate on the subject matter . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; rather , sat , if we , instead of keeping the discussion so general , say , instead of talking about the problem , that we , to protect the state into our bedrooms , simply targeted that it might be ab@@ used by large , gri@@ ev@@ ous men who are against them compared to the advantage , would you then be willing to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think it is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a judicial action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - but there are still places in the world where the children are legal or remain the norm , even though there are laws which they say . &quot;

&quot; Sunday early on Sunday , the Office of the State Prosec@@ ution hosted the local news service Y@@ ar@@ News that they were min@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; through the sk@@ e@@ wers of web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia content again . &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ speaking Wikipedia page was presented on January 18 , 2012 , to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IPA copyright legislation in the USA . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC BY @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month , Turkey has now locked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ edia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; daily for day , how important is the platform for users to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and fans of TV series are fighting against the lock .
&quot; though many techni@@ qu@@ ated Internet users are used to use tools for blocking websites ( a recent article by the New York Times states that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence in the world ) , most common Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; even though Turkey has been locked out by Wikipedia , as recently published in an published report by the Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University will find regular blocking of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; after China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive C@@ ens@@ orship by Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , several mir@@ ror@@ pages ( pages , which reflect the contents of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , as the platform provided all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( so host computer lin@@ ers ) which does not make itself difficult in the system of domain name and therefore makes a complete c@@ ens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; however , the content is det@@ ach@@ able in spite of legal prohibition . &quot;
in a Blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS report on his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( on the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything to put snap@@ shots of Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this may help users to view at least all Wikipedia content , even if they can &apos;t reach the www.@@ wi@@ ktion@@ ary@@ .org website itself . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS gave also that this step was implemented independently of the Wik@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely a screen@@ shots and no live versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wik@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to avoid the lock . &quot;
&quot; Crist@@ ian Cons@@ onn@@ i from Wik@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ p@@ ci@@ .org , a Mir@@ ror@@ page from Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that everyone can use to explo@@ it similar mirrors @-@ pages when Wikipedia is blocked . &quot;
Cons@@ onn@@ i reported the Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member and employee at Mozilla in the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks of Pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy @-@ address , a Mir@@ ror . &quot;
&quot; access to another URL , which is not the original . that &apos;s what you can see is from Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; essentially , the server runs the request to the right Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the content of Wikipedia itself then if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
for this is executed by a server that is not in Turkey .

I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park with a world natural heritage . what could there be better to give for a passionate Wild@@ look ! !
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ aj ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had a call from my father that on the shore of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard .
the dam is just a few minutes away from the tourist place Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started working with my camera and was there in a few minutes there .
&quot; my father was watching him and showed me the place on the other river side , where the leop@@ ard was found , and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! ! &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a , and originally appeared on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community organisation from India . &quot;
an revised version was re @-@ released as part of a Content @-@ Shar@@ ing Agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , there are women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands , or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ o@@ uns or say &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hatt@@ is@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h to respect women that they should respect the social pressure to the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm in life . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned from the Indian state of O@@ sm@@ a by a pseu@@ do court and spur@@ ned by her family and the village community after being addressed a married relatives with the name . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also not call upon name , is also common among men . however , they did not fear less assign@@ ments if any , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of Pun@@ e , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , among them health staff , and house@@ wives , a unique club and were therefore quickly became the main discussion of the city . &quot;
&quot; it is a place only for them alone , in which they discuss and discuss the host@@ ility of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , who exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the community video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ate for the dismant@@ ling of the patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was working for seven years with the help of their vide@@ oc@@ am@@ era to the coverage of practices , such as child marriage to the ban of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected , and direc@@ ts this club . &quot;
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and made it at the same time as ambassador to the mur@@ al .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion , did women who call their husbands at the name . &quot;
she decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their husbands , an agent , whom they have all condemned , and never asked any question . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
this tradition test@@ ifies that a woman respects her husband and wish him long life .
&quot; a woman who doesn &apos;t stop this will be considered back as a woman , without mor@@ ality . &quot;
tradition is so deeply ro@@ oted up that we never did so far back to this discussion round .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini wanted her husband to have never known her husband &apos;s husband , at home how it works . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law .
Roh@@ ini tells you :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband silent long after the video was at an end .
&quot; Pra@@ k@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said , I should call him from now on by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started her first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in Bag@@ ini .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; never before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women were protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in Ut@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in motion . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy , anno@@ yed , lov@@ ingly , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked them all , &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our husbands , but they can call us as they want , meaning that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over her lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the breaking of a year@@ ling tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells you :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during all the practice , she just drove before , and another decided to leave the whole day fru@@ stration against him and his family , spreading it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; even in A@@ dr@@ en@@ al@@ in@@ r@@ ush on how to have broken with an ancient bridge , the women decided that they actually would try to call their husbands at the name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next days , Roh@@ ini received a wide variety of reports . &quot;
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put on women in his head , saying : his wife could not stop saying his name . &quot;
another wise member decided to do it with supper before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was an error . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini said that I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understand@@ able and the situation art@@ ete in violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices , such as the wearing of interest in the red point on the forehead , which shows the marriage status : &quot;
why do only women have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would bear the interest no@@ red point if it was possible . &quot;
&quot; he laughed only , and I heard that he might carry him . &quot;
&quot; the other women were not completely stopped , but I mean , they are now in a better position to choose to carry it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion hits a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives . &quot;
&quot; we make a trip with every discussion tour .
normally we take lunch and water and go out into the box .
&quot; I don &apos;t want to make the women take care of what could hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their lives and talked about things which they had never done before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years , and yet I have worked on some things such as our ident@@ ities to our husbands , never talked to hon@@ estly . &quot;
&quot; it feels great , certain things can be no@@ isy , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only bore sar@@ is in their marriage .
&quot; most of them is okay , but some wanted to carry a sal@@ inity @-@ Kur@@ ta , a vast shirt of a pants , they don &apos;t have . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own coat @-@ dial , the mor@@ ality associated with the Sar@@ is and much more , sm@@ ug@@ ely Roh@@ ini her own pair Kur@@ tas ( upper hem@@ den ) in a discussion round , so that women could carry them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a where they can carry Je@@ ans and Roh@@ ini is sure that they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; at the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion , Roh@@ ini confirmed that things come slowly into the roll : &quot;
&quot; so far , we have made only little steps . &quot;
&quot; some women tested it a few times , but then they stopped to say the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do not make it , but only if they are alone and there are no other family members . &quot;
one or two will continue to say the name of their husbands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their fore@@ heads .
the women in discussion hits that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the shooting of more mobility or its own coat @-@ dial - at the end of a difficult to navigate .
&quot; in making each other self @-@ confidence , they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
as Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a sacrifice of patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
&quot; however , this club gives us the confidence that something will change . &quot;
&quot; and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction , if every woman enters the club and other people will say what we are talking about and what we are doing . &quot;
we all sit in the same boat .

&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping persons for the organs , probably for super@@ st@@ itious purposes , worried the police of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations into life to stop the practices . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated and a part of the organs were taken .
&quot; two men were arrested and in the consequence , they stood that the organs of Sh@@ aman in Tanzania and Malawi have been used . &quot;
&quot; it will give the local super@@ st@@ ition , that the head of a man of a man &apos;s gold will discover gold , declared the police officer of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia to the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that succ@@ essive attacks on single @-@ headed men were registered in Mozambique .
a further group to aim for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country led a mission to investigate these practices .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of Southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government &apos;s campaigns had developed to fight these super@@ st@@ itions and pre@@ ju@@ dice . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who have prepared to travel into the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who are travelling to Mozambique are purpose rit@@ ual men in Mozambique are aiming for rit@@ ual attacks , warned the Mozambique police following the latest generation of three @-@ three @-@ strong men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ k , where the kill@@ ings took place were arrested . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ sen@@ e Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and residents of the town of In@@ ham@@ b@@ ane in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police have already gone after : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the pu@@ bic kill@@ ings are involved in the death of the dead men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of regular individuals for the extraction and the sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Z@@ amb@@ Ã©@@ zia , has given the police of the Republic of Mozambique ( PR@@ M ) , which also exists that there is a faith in Mozambique , according to which the victims were in the head , the wealth of wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men were murdered with hair loss problems in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ reira Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the chron@@ icle of the Blo@@ g@@ gers arms S@@ na@@ i@@ ppa , indicating that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty of which Mozambique is opposite : &quot;
&quot; I want GER@@ NE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambi@@ k , TH@@ AT S@@ Y ashamed A land where people would like to turn up on the road and other services , a nation , in which people would like to make sex against good notes , a country in which neither the al@@ bin@@ os can be hun@@ ted or even better for super@@ st@@ itious purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; to get to a quick rich@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; despite the sin@@ cer@@ ity of the phenomena , some had the opportunity to avoid hum@@ our humor . &quot;

&quot; free Bas@@ sel : ne@@ ti@@ ces Under Seri@@ ous , December 2012 ( in English ) new reactions to the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and dis@@ sident Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photograph of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Liu X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version is published within a partnership agreement by Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the incar@@ nation of Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o arrested in international community , after his lawyer had been announced at the end of June that he was hosp@@ itali@@ zed due to liver cancer in the terminal stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State Court ) , after having responded to the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o that demanded democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in China has given Li@@ us case as an internal matter , and a speaker , he told it as &quot; not necessary to discuss this thing with any other country . &quot;
&quot; however , China continues to receive views of the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , poet Liu X@@ ia , allow to release himself a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summar@@ ized some reactions from abroad .
United Nations
&quot; po@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met by the end of June Chinese officials to discuss the case of Liu . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment if the United Nations should practice pressure to allow Liu in foreign countries . &quot;
Norway and Norway
&quot; Norway , Norway &apos;s Minister of Ministers Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us . &quot;
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came into the Sto@@ cks , after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010 , although the Norwegian government hur@@ ried that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued only in December last year . Norway signed an agreement in order to absorb the salmon crew to China because exports since 2010 were largely blocked .
&quot; after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee brought his hope to an unconditional release to the expression and invited Liu to take his price in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; because of its imprisonment , he was unable to meet his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Liu was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a decision in which China was asked to free Liu and his wife to free from the house arrest and allow him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mog@@ her@@ ini , demanded the release of China as well as the release of Li@@ us on the 30th June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect that China lifts all limitations of Mr. Li@@ us wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they want to meet and receive all visits , which they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States
&quot; U.S. ambassador Terry Bran@@ stad told us that the Americans would like to him , that he would have the possibility of treatment abroad , in@@ as@@ much as it is necessary to help him . &quot;
&quot; the message of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AFP on 27 June that the embassy release the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also his wife Ms. Liu X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US embassy moved from China to herself , with the utter@@ ance of the Foreign Ministry that &quot; no country have the right to interv@@ ene and ir@@ responsible comments about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel agents and access to medical care in its choice , to which they have to have according to Chinese Constitution and legal system , and international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the US Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and Ted Cruz did not have a decision in the Congress to push the Chinese government to push the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
I urge China to release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o without paying attention to proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o
Germany
&quot; on 3 July , Berlin , the German government speaker Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote that Liu explains all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o needs the highest priority . &quot;
the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources reported in Beijing news agency , that China had doubts about whether the vort@@ ex could overs@@ ha@@ dow the visit in Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on June 28 , the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um requested China to provide a reasonable medical care to provide a reasonable medical care and allow him to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AFP that Li@@ us Mrs , Liu X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but police have always monitored the room in the hospital and that Liu is not allowed to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um says further :
&quot; Canada requires China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , to uph@@ old free and respect for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France
&quot; France &apos;s foreign Ministry of Foreign Affairs urged China to release Liu from humanitarian grounds , on 29 June : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments , which he , ir@@ respective of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and his family are to contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news broadcast France Info had already reported that the French government would welcome Liu in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information that France will ultimately succeed . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; the Council of the Social Affairs in Taiwan requested China on 27 June to release Liu &apos;s release and a greater tolerance towards those who want peaceful funds to challenge political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ n@@ u , also called on China &apos;s ruling party , also called to allow the ill of intellec@@ tuals to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was concerned in an explanation on 28 June around Liu very worried and gave that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us Well@@ being . &quot;
he said about Liu :
&quot; it is my faith , that the initiatives that he took and had been punished for a sin@@ c@@ ere , more stable and wealthy China , which in turn would have contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt very moved and encouraged me personally when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellec@@ tuals and affected citizens , inspired by Liu Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter 08 signed , which stands for democracy , liberty and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am should be regarded as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blog@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Association of State of New York , the Minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he support Singapore should be considered a city .
nobody asked whether New York is a democracy ...
&quot; this is , with most people taking a mistake . &quot;
I tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ al@@ ier@@ io accused the Minister of Justice to twist the logic in order to defend the existing authorities in Singapore .
&quot; and then , according to all our efforts and offered to create this valuable country , we hear that we do not end a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the sight of a flight before the responsibilities , a must viol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons behind Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am were not very no@@ bel : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of his , he appeared irre@@ conc@@ ei@@ vable un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco , or New York alike . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re can be reached by the author@@ itarian mach@@ inations , who for@@ sake the Democrats , leaving the twi@@ sted logic , since it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week the final week of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our Ju@@ di@@ k@@ ative , our political system truly non @-@ answers . &quot;
he would ask the relevant questions with non @-@ responses .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng calls for Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am on his opinion , because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city is , so to which country is our city ... &quot;
&quot; short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our advert@@ ised K Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am would take up the effort to clarify this point , if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; commenting on the blog , he comments on the critics that one should start to read the entire tran@@ script of the conference , so that you can understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am better according to which Singapore was a city and no country . &quot;
please read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is more a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; as a country , &quot; &quot; he declared why the elections are so important in Singapore , even if we are looking forward to free and righteous elections . &quot;
he contra@@ cted Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said , &quot; Singapore &quot; is not a country , &quot; he obviously doesn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
Cl@@ ement T@@ an shows his dis@@ appointment of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such pol@@ em@@ ic statement .
I am aware of what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Gar@@ de , which I expected to agree with them or not , but this is another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure whether he really believes that he is defended correctly . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review lays the vulner@@ ability of Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ ams arguments :
does Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am granted a mistake on &quot; ben@@ ign a mistake &quot; or was it a Fre@@ ud@@ ge speaker ?
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are considered as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , in which country goes back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
Singapore is unique . it is equally countryside and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government wireless , the testimony of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ m@@ ug@@ am is of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city ? &quot;
who needs to pay our prime minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the journal Journey of a Dec@@ ade invites you to anni@@ hil@@ ate , Singapore is always a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this set seems to have off@@ ended many people of Singapur ...
nobody ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we were always a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that &apos;s not quite right . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .

global Vo@@ ices asked for short his editors : what is the most Miss@@ ing aspect of your residence or homeland ?
&quot; their answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world uncovered , and another fac@@ et should be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ pson , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question posed by me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have lived and returned to Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation occurs , it is considered to be cour@@ te@@ ous , interest in his conversation partners , making personal questions . &quot;
&quot; on my clari@@ fication , mostly the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , ice hockey , nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans may cook until they are kept for Americans , but anno@@ ys me not . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distingu@@ ishes us Canadian Americans . &quot;
&quot; this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans make a Canadian flag well visible on their ru@@ ck@@ sack , if they are travelling . &quot;
they all love Canadian .
by contrast ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began 20 years ago to travel through the world - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always worn small A@@ hor@@ n@@ leaves on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
there are no weapons with us !
gay E@@ hen have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are polite .
we obviously say very often &quot; exc@@ use . &quot;
Canada also applies to ethnic groups as well as the toler@@ ant country against ethnic groups .
we are not like those guys south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends I ad@@ mi@@ red very much . &quot;
it would not make me anything if you would switch me Johnny from Dallas as an example .
with Marc out of Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; firstly , as &quot; nice &quot; to become called &quot; nice &quot; means to be sk@@ ill@@ ful , such as the ben@@ evol@@ ent , gentle , but trag@@ ically , in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flanders of &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( which has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation of people like N@@ ed Flanders , it would be indeed a step forward . but the actual problem lies that &quot; nice &quot; no personality has . &quot;
&quot; there are no edges and edges , nothing at which one can encounter . &quot;
&quot; be harmless , to be in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous and to make no attention . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good when you want to remain un@@ noticed in the background , fer@@ na@@ b of the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even be going to say , to say that the desire , free and alone , is a leading international Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders advert@@ ise as &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool polit@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence along with the neighbours .
&quot; we are missing the warm @-@ heart@@ ed , open kindness , which I connect with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) Justin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice . &quot; our prime minister has made Canada just sexy .
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ ded Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; one in Thailand famous pop @-@ band has published a music video showing the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and re@@ united the civilian government in 2014 . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells his girlfriend .
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers to the continued military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the country &apos;s situation .
the video to song was a huge success .
&quot; the video uploaded to Facebook alone within the first three days , and received 8,@@ 800 Lik@@ es . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists sent the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , as special as it is the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; have a look at the videos of the videos that relate to some of the political issues , which Thailand has har@@ assed over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; relate to the dra@@ con@@ ical section 44 of the preliminary constitution , which gave the Commander in Chief of the army &apos;s absolute decision making an important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your setting &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for the &quot; integration process &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians , and other people who are considered a critics from the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crimin@@ ality , whose v@@ age and un@@ clear rules are often used by the authorities to render activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit in the army has been set up , supervised the online content and persons accused of having sl@@ anders the monarchy , was charged on the grounds of the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand reli@@ es a strict statement against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ estic &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the war was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the Army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to purchase , is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although security experts ask them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax ev@@ asion . &quot;
&quot; in the video even shows how people will be thrown into a black v@@ ans , before you put it into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are sitting in prison , because they are supposed to have caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened long pen@@ alties , they should ins@@ ult the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the band members , presented the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; which was already used by coup leaders during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in ruins of the vul@@ tures in eastern Asia

&quot; the following article written by Dmit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ no@@ v , first published on the website of OC Media , published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society is re@@ covering very slowly in East @-@ Asia , especially in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ov@@ arian War was officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the deser@@ ted villages of the northern districts in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ basins of Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Asia @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ n@@ oses live in the area today . &quot;
such settlements are also called vul@@ tures towns in Ab@@ ch@@ asia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people still in this ghost . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of 16,000 people had barely increased after over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early &apos; 60s , called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ schu@@ ki@@ w@@ kas , are symbo@@ lically standing for the decline and devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are fallen and rarely they are inhabited by more than two families .

&quot; at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , I met a native elderly man . &quot;
he starts a conversation and it is difficult to end this .
&quot; all this is a result of war . &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
it &apos;s nevertheless unique . &quot;
&quot; before the war , the village was full of life . &quot;
&quot; there were community centres , schools and kinder@@ gardens , served all of the community . &quot;
now there are only paved road with f@@ aded spl@@ ash buildings .
&quot; people who once lived at this place lived and their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , managed to leave the district . &quot;
&quot; in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live about fifty inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; there are about 38 people living in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v accommodation , which are still one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where they are dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they withdraw immediately . &quot;
&quot; our mother is forbidden to us that we let us take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she was simply forbidden to us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers on her friend something and suddenly leave they leave the destroyed buildings and van@@ ish .
many people work in the area for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al@@ ug@@ ol .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sist@@ ence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as cattle breeding , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the laps .
the district administration supplies candles for free candles and bread to the villages .

&quot; I do not know what will happen , but we will grow cour@@ g@@ ettes &quot;
&quot; ten years ago , an older woman was named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya , as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina hasn &apos;t left Ab@@ ch@@ asia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ asia . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina wants to take no financial aid from her daughter , and insi@@ sted that she supports her young grand@@ son instead . &quot;
Gal@@ inas monthly R@@ ente are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you neither have a vegetable garden even a house , it &apos;s very difficult to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
&quot; aun@@ t G@@ alya tells that she and other vill@@ agers try to get regularly , and holidays together . &quot;

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman , as well as a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if a holiday , we visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; &quot; T@@ ante G@@ alya her to her . &quot; they said that we could build zu@@ cchini . &quot;
I have prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we are going to grow cour@@ g@@ ettes . &quot;
&quot; you can get acc@@ ust@@ omed to everything , &quot;
&quot; G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ation@@ alist Nat@@ ascha , together with her husband and the five common children lived in her house for some time . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day she reminds of the village of Dor@@ s@@ ben in front of the war .
&quot; despite the relatives who live in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ as@@ el broke out ) , they did not leave the opportunity . &quot;

Nat@@ asha received around $ 9 child money for every child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ ascha &apos;s kinder@@ garten were once found , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and h@@ ens . &quot;
she tells that it was first a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .

many people believe this building was destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , however , it has more to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
&quot; after the war , there was hardly any work and all lived like them was right . &quot;
&quot; every day , I remember how the city and the war were once . &quot;
&quot; as our conversation incl@@ ined to the end , a small boy is running to us . &quot;
he runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .

a group of children now persecuted the ball .
&quot; while walking , some of them cast stones at the falling building . &quot;

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa houses &quot; migrants in their long journey
&quot; Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez manages a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , on the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

&quot; this article by Amy Bra@@ cken , published on April 19 , 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org , published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants , cross Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula he is located on the border to Guatemala .
it is a very simple hotel near the city centre .
&quot; it is managed by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mex@@ ic@@ an@@ erin , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink br@@ ist frame and golden brown earrings in ted@@ dy bear shape . &quot;
she is called Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and grew up in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) become a target for Afri@@ cans and Ha@@ iti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel rather has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,50 dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , br@@ ittle walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ r@@ ots in a cage .
there is no sign@@ post to the hotel - but hundreds of African and ha@@ iti@@ an migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells us the people in full small bus@@ ses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you M@@ um Africa ? .
&quot; at the time it &apos;s rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on boxes outside . &quot;
she would not refuse to refuse .
&quot; she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they can &apos;t pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m that frigh@@ tened away from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived in a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ om is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a jog@@ ging ) pos@@ ing with Conc@@ ep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he respon@@ ds to a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her , as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister , hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard of other mer@@ chan@@ ters of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the circuit , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
&quot; he tells the Ha@@ iti@@ ans and the Afri@@ cans often travel together the route and that , the Afri@@ cans speak on What@@ s@@ app by Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; as many of his leaders , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker at the construction site of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he started his journey into the United States . &quot;
&quot; he has been a guest in M@@ um Africa since months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money , to buy the Bust@@ ers to Ti@@ juana . &quot;
I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again , &quot; he respon@@ ding . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells that their guests are often sending messages when they are gone to gr@@ in , or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
it explains that their Christian faith is the impulse of their work .
&quot; they don &apos;t know much about Africa , but their guests have taught chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well @-@ known , but she is not the only spar@@ king hope for migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
&quot; at the other end of the city , a sa@@ w@@ g@@ asse to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela leads . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family lived in their little house . &quot;
he is polic@@ eman and has found that the Bust@@ ets are sold to many African migrants to be sold too expensive .
&quot; he began to help them to get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment 25 people are here , mainly Ha@@ iti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ cian explains that he knows what the guests do .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border with the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . this is the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after he lived for three years , he was sent out of the United States after a raid on his workplace . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other residents open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press money without a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he was asked for an accommodation and an unknown , an omni@@ vor@@ ous , has offered it its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests .
&quot; in the courses , trav@@ ellers should consult their teleph@@ ones . &quot;
a small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia .
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy about her that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
&quot; like a proud grandmother , she prepar@@ es her album with numerous photos . &quot;
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African fol@@ kl@@ es , who made her a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and elderly . &quot;
&quot; she &apos;s sad , while she introduces herself shortly . &quot;
&quot; Ya ze fu@@ eron , &quot; repeated every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ in@@ jiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check Point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang of Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the residents of X@@ in@@ jiang , an ethnic minority region in the West of China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on 10 July , the cell phone users received a mobile notification in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi a mobile notification in which it indicates the district government to install a surveillance app named J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; will hin@@ der access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities called the app for more than the com@@ b@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h Women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture because they had installed the app shortly after they had replaced the app . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app states that the app and distribution ways would determine and pursue the terrorists together with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ w@@ angs Website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service provider with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is the block of por@@ no@@ graphic websites , by online fraud , Tro@@ ians and Ph@@ ishing sites to make users alert how much time they spend on how much time they spend online and control their own home network . &quot;
&quot; with the filters for min@@ ors , this app will help children to develop a healthy lifestyle . &quot;
&quot; of course , an app with these features can be used in various ways . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; or even h@@ ack@@ ers could manipul@@ ate the home network of a person to manipul@@ ate or steal home network . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announ@@ cements on digital c@@ ens@@ orship in China mostly focused on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often dark for those who live in distant ethnic minority regions such as X@@ in@@ jiang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme interest and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ etic internet connections . &quot;
&quot; based on Twitter based media Out@@ let &quot; Images from Main Country , China , the cen@@ sored news in China , showed photos of a chec@@ point where polic@@ emen cont@@ acted in@@ discri@@ min@@ ed if they had installed the monitoring app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure the people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people will install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are found on a chec@@ kl@@ as with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; people are forced to use devices that are intended for older people , to use . &quot;
this is a form of captivity by the rest of the growth .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main Country China &quot; ( Cel@@ est@@ v@@ ang Product Description , which is based on a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password requirements of a Windows operating system , thereby receiving un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ in@@ jiang . &quot;
&quot; in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may have a reaction to the instructions of the City Party Council to minim@@ ize the prolifer@@ ation of illegal content . &quot;
&quot; all government branches , authorities and party @-@ related institutions , including universities and research institutions are required to follow the instructions of Cyber@@ security Office during operation of their computers and communications equipment . &quot;
&quot; a recent report from Freedom House , a U.S. human rights organization , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ in@@ jiang , the authorities issued the authorities on 27 June in a district of regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , until 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and anni@@ hil@@ ate any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , this promotion does not viol@@ ate the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
sleep or death - Part 1 : everything cri@@ es after death
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo of : Cor@@ rie Bar@@ kli@@ on ( CC BY 2.0 ) .
this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death &quot; in which the activist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison .
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and stell@@ st that you are all alone at one place where everything is important . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually broken down , and revealed a truth which is clear , both inside and from outside . &quot;
one who makes the glory of their name .
one who has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that won &apos;t allow met@@ aph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality takes you up and you look behind the scenes , the beautiful scenes and performer - turn the characters in essence of flesh and blood , and everything cri@@ es after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt solve yourself in smoke , and you will become conscious of your existence even though the earth is tra@@ pped on the axis of trouble . you will clear that you are caught between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have taken me and my father three times , but that was not enough to put my lesson , as the boss of security staff was form@@ ulated , with the promise that the fourth time would become a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he set his power over us , making it even the sim@@ pl@@ est concepts that we knew . &quot;
five you@@ ths were torn apart from a peaceful protein as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our Revolution .
&quot; it was enough to disman@@ tle the city the darkness of the night with &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; -@@ cry . &quot;
&quot; all the quarters were cov@@ eted , but my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was silent , mot@@ ion@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I had no high demands on a city that is con@@ gest@@ ed to the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their compli@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little calm after the power supply had heard in the fourth night . &quot;
I broke through the silence by shou@@ ting several times &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house shelter .
I heard my voice contradic@@ ted by the silence .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to come together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we sat down to a splendid picture that filled my expectations full and fulfilled . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment you are aware that you delivered the spirit out of the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t care in the hand . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my Father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the Military Security Building . &quot;
he set up .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey can you go down - nothing can return to you , after you have swallowed them all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear as you cry &apos; All@@ ahu &apos; Ak@@ bar &apos; or you &apos;re only brave enough to cry , if we are not in the vicinity . &quot;
his eyes met on me .
&quot; and you will be afraid to watch me in the eyes , and not to the ground . &quot;
what I did so did nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood before this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was on my fool@@ is@@ hness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure , when I replied , &quot; I didn &apos;t think you had forgotten my voice for yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation , which could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret what I said . &quot;
&quot; put it in sol@@ itary and his father , with it . &quot;
&quot; like his father , right with it . &quot;
the ank of this cursed sentence lies to me now in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a se@@ greg@@ ated torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I scre@@ ams the farm .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , through the courtyard and into the second office , which leads through a gear to the single cells . &quot;
I prepared all the details exactly before I charge the room .
otherwise they have allocated a bigger cell in this time .
&quot; I must share it with only one more prisoner , and may immediately put me immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the civil servants left the cell , and I laid back on a well @-@ known communication method : to strike your fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ fin was a &quot; heir . &quot;
&quot; after a long hes@@ itation , he finally answered me . &quot;
apparently there was no middle aged aged in any of the surrounding cells that is similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness there can be no mark@@ eters of sight , and doctors do not exist ; we are all the only numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice is similar to my sounds ? &quot;
all answers inter@@ fere with its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the large cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
investig@@ ators had assured me ; they would be free when I stay .
liar .
&quot; I would like to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row , to distribute all these cro@@ ws , which l@@ acks fruit in the garden of my head . &quot;
from the distance I still hear them &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that made us the flower in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Thunder &quot; , &quot; Pl@@ aying on 13 . S@@ ure of Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be heard .
&quot; thus , the secret was to protect themselves : to protect the state security in front of us and to prevent the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wit@@ e dial@@ ect - so they played their counter@@ essi@@ on@@ elle dial@@ ect - so they played their denomin@@ ational narr@@ ative and disgu@@ ised the close eye view of their world domin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; this is no house , which is not a country ; it is a curse to call it co@@ exist@@ ence to turn the crimin@@ als of her cl@@ ans into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I shared the listening room and meet at Abu I@@ mad , a sl@@ ender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me so . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the expressions that you der@@ ive from him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can join this day with your life as you &apos;ll see this day and protests , which will soon be an end soon . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I don &apos;t have it used to answer .
I really can &apos;t say anything more precisely when ins@@ ults and stro@@ kes turned into a friendly conversation for me to an ordinary communication tool .
when and how this happened was irrelevant .
&quot; some voice in me said that I was able to pun@@ ish myself or badly , although I had done nothing to make this punishment . &quot;
at the penalty in all its diversity .
&quot; his command is to ri@@ p me as much flesh as possible from the body . &quot;
he calls the lov@@ ingly &quot; confession &quot; confession .
&quot; it begins with a plastic pipe , which probably comes from the clo@@ ak . &quot;
your Hen@@ ker erg@@ es to your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with it , and you cannot keep your cry back . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams had not yet enough him enough , which is why they inter@@ act the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first capture , I asked whether the investig@@ ators had worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to normal working amenities . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables dressed in each other , to present us from their sight , great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
&quot; within one hour , three of them changed , while I was still in the range . &quot;
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body , and my voice , which I heard . &quot;
the Hen@@ ker noted the cooling down and found no delight to them why he is coming next to an electrically charged rod .
&quot; electricity through my whole body , enough to supply my whole neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; my semi @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
&quot; after two terrible hours , he decided he had to fulfil his duty for that night . &quot;
this must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to lay down again , let &apos;s say that was my only option . &quot;
several hours passed away that came to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light ful@@ fil@@ s the space &quot; .@@ R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fic@@ ker . &quot;
&quot; I reply with the voice of an exhau@@ st@@ ive young people : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to worry about dre@@ ad@@ ful concerns . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk away , you are re@@ located . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise it had always been released .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian Rap@@ per Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib speaks about the rights of LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free opinion from expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib smoke a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ ib brings most of his time inside ; once again he co@@ ve to his screen , to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but where@@ of you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or to discover nic@@ ot@@ ine be@@ ating lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel had forced its occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from her village in Palestine in which she had lived as fel@@ im@@ ye@@ en ( about : Farmer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ ib is a passionate activist , who was transferred to the conservative majority ( for six years ) and asking their original opinions about gender roles , sexu@@ ality and free opinion of expression through art and rap@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; with his music that often deals with topics like Orient@@ alism , rac@@ ism and the situation of the whole Arab world . all these topics not only find in its hom@@ etown of Amman , but also in cities that spread from Damascus in Syria to a whole of San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ ib sees itself as someone who is not affected in his thinking , and he can feel the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if it fails to access it , he swe@@ eps on the US foreign policy a special dis@@ like . &quot;
H@@ da@@ ib sees his art in his studio in Amman .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib doesn &apos;t believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian resistance of the second generation &quot; - so he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own life circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ ib st@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a human being &quot; while in water sol@@ dered nest @-@ cafÃ© in two cups , it is the holy month Ram@@ ad@@ an ; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fa@@ sten from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ram@@ ad@@ an .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ ib revealed a certain weakness for keeping with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee at a sen@@ ing hot Jun@@ it@@ ag has little with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the shu@@ ffle speak warm coffee and the s@@ quad@@ ron of the K@@ ent cigarette into the nose in the first line of freedom .
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it avo@@ ids easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ ad@@ an water - to avoid not in prison . &quot;
recently the Interior Minister Jord@@ an@@ ians had cancelled a appearance of the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila to the second time .
&quot; the Muslim Brotherhood of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argu@@ ed that sexual orientation of the country is contradic@@ ted by the Muslim Brotherhood Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , the cultural and traditional nor@@ ms of the country . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring , human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous acti@@ vism that places the established legitim@@ acy of author@@ itarian regim@@ es in the entire region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila inv@@ ents the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; which continued to apply for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement is probably not simply sil@@ ky rh@@ et@@ oric , but actually reflects a clear cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which occurs in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work clearly . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the H@@ da@@ ib traditional gender @-@ nor@@ ms turned out to body by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have been vo@@ re@@ hel@@ i@@ chen . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an obvious unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust .
&quot; over the past few years , in Jordan , the number of &apos; honorary citizens &apos; has increased - the un@@ official out@@ ward outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ mor@@ ga@@ des reached its peak in 2016 ; however , it still exists , that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women , victims attempted murder or domestic violence . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on frag@@ ile control from 1954 women , women who are under threat to family @-@ family violence , &quot; and for their release is often necessary to have a few years of bureaucr@@ atic expend@@ itu@@ res as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ bs Music enjoys great popularity and is well known for it to rever@@ b the topics that are long as tab@@ u in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib den@@ ies that his work is politically , however , knowing that he is his music that is full of explic@@ it att@@ itudes on sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , politics was en@@ fe@@ eb@@ le , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ ib takes the question about the Palestinian identity in attack .
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs , which are politically politically , can continue . &quot;
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ ib released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is often repeated :
&quot; you are free , and each other is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ ib describes the world as a kind of market , on which one can , in his words , &quot; that can be what you want &quot; - be it faith or anti @-@ faith , H@@ et@@ ero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he not@@ ices that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and les@@ bi@@ ans and that comments on gender equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cen@@ sored until in 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ ib led an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian On@@ line@@ program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments were torn from the context , twi@@ sted and been cen@@ sored in his opinion . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube , it was uploaded without cuts , but he was only a working version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ ib buys open to the Arab LGB@@ T@@ Q + Community and represents the opinion that int@@ oler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als do not speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he menti@@ ons Abu Nu@@ das , a poet of the eighth century , still today remained in remembrance thanks to its hom@@ o@@ erotic poetry . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ ib wonders : if Abu Nu@@ das , who later was to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century . why cannot Jord@@ an@@ ians not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ ib , did nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ L@@ eila or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ic kingdom , it is nothing new anymore that the government &apos;s attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes become silent . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian Intelligence Service took up several former government officials and members of the teaching position , with the reason they expressed in commentary in social media to solve the problems with which deeply ro@@ oted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the show H@@ da@@ i@@ bs said that only the top of the ice@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jord@@ an@@ ians . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is an independent slide and take . Jordan has denied a gig in a row , but the way of progress - so it looks H@@ da@@ ib - consists of slow , thought and intern@@ alized changes . he is sure that these changes from day to day at the heart of the Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ ib dreams , like millions of other Arabs also , of a Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to experience &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will be carried out by music , art and literature of real and basic op@@ enn@@ ess - and not by bombs , tra@@ um@@ positions , and artificial nature . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; until it is done , H@@ da@@ ib continues to ra@@ p and resist the resistance . &quot;
this report was conducted by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Management , which was heard as a student Fel@@ low . &quot;
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these large , extravag@@ ant war@@ d@@ olls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories about the origin of the Neb@@ uta festivals .
&quot; one might susp@@ ect that there is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festivals , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ kus . another theory states that the Fest@@ ing and dancing over a thousand years have crossed over a thousand years to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we could grab a few great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
you can imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint center in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en again for a long time : two fort@@ resses have just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and another breathtaking way to spend his summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was here and I watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the view of a 18 meter high car was unbelievable .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rare were external appar@@ ition and body care so important as in this history , because it helps to keep the Peru@@ vian youth from crime , and promote a legitim@@ ate profession as to the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us main marina , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic centre of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate , where street smo@@ kes and illegal drug retailers are everyday . &quot;
a survey released in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance , and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sport@@ s@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has led to make sure that more standardi@@ zation can be found in the experienced hands of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers which can make these elabor@@ ate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ s@@ ers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other in order to show who of them can create the ec@@ cent@@ ric L@@ ooks like you can see in the following video ( more videos to current competitions there is Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os public Facebook profile ) .
&quot; education institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , who found himself in El Call@@ ao , found here a chance to convince young people to share their weapons against hair@@ dresser tools and instead of bad advice an apprentices@@ hip in hair@@ dres@@ s@@ men , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can seize a profession which is currently in fashion . &quot;
&quot; prior to March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of its successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the community and the district , which we are very proud , because of love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; &quot; Liebes@@ messages of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea after T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this entry will be published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people who we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who have cast out to suit the aff@@ ection ? &quot;
exactly this question went out of the two young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ Ã¡@@ r@@ ra@@ ga from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation not out of the head and inspired them to the campaign cart@@ as p@@ or la Recon@@ cili@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) to write young people to write gu@@ err@@ illa fighters .
&quot; recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government concluded a peace agreement with the gu@@ err@@ illa movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces Colombia ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the sign of peace agreement was considered as significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received for his mer@@ its the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; in front of Colombia , there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ err@@ illa fighters that have lived for many years in illegal camps , have been exposed to war rh@@ et@@ oric and around the clock , their weapons were forced to ins@@ ure themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; in turn , the Colom@@ bian society itself , who had acc@@ ust@@ omed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , now has to support them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Crist@@ ian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bian must join together and help integration process .
&quot; and exactly what they did : until now , thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters to welcome them back in society . &quot;
&quot; the goal of the campaign are 6@@ 900 letters - one for each former gu@@ err@@ illa fighters , which should be handed to personally . &quot;
Valentine &apos;s Day as a inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for Recon@@ ciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Lau@@ re@@ ate , which was held in Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there Leonardo and Crist@@ ian had the opportunity to talk shortly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ arth@@ i , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this declared that we love those who love those who love thousands of love letters , but those who need much more necessary . &quot;
&quot; he plan , he told , in this year he talked to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , which is now ready to build up a new life . &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is willing to make the dis@@ course of a war history to a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; so far , more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bog@@ ot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I never thought that someone would forgive me &apos;
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of J@@ aver@@ i@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bog@@ ot@@ way Foundation to create the letters in person . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were so on how they had done it earlier in order to oppos@@ e the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no commands , but letters of sub@@ s@@ men from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s unbelievable how many different emotions you can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between &quot; , &quot; told the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ nez Av@@ ila later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca Province , described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after having passed the letters , a former fighters led me through the camp of gu@@ err@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , where the gu@@ err@@ illa fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ err@@ illa fighters who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed there was a M@@ GL @-@ pomegran@@ ate , a fatal weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I said to him , &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; he answered , &quot; I answer a letter which someone wrote to me . &quot; &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before me in my life , someone wrote something so beautiful , that &apos;s why I answer it . &quot; &quot; I suddenly heard the tears on the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I h@@ ug@@ ged him , and sat down beside the pomegran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter , and would help him to write this ep@@ ist@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else than war . he never had anything else from life than war . &quot; &quot; the F@@ ARC was the only opportunity to keep him and his six brothers before the Hung@@ er@@ to@@ d . &quot; I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
&quot; but now I know , that there is a society out there , waiting for us with open arms . &quot;
until now I have learned how to deal with weapons .
&quot; but now where peace re@@ igns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the start @-@ start , students and some leader of the F@@ ARC came together on a discussion round together . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up and already war , and the F@@ ARC already out@@ lived in secret places . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC states the history of the organization , its ide@@ als and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have experienced how the social in@@ justice organized by the state on the whole Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to create a political party , we can contribute to the society in this country fair . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magn@@ itude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; those people who had never found hearing , and had no electoral law , and to know that the people I often have seen as a monster , and even those who have turned around as monsters , who were turned around through their lives and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality , in which the country lives , hurt me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and so much damage have caused us to contribute to us , and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have answered the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp at Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , the Archbishop of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colombia was prophes@@ ying that there would rule peace after de@@ hydr@@ ation .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as ine@@ quality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to rise up and to protest the weapons , and that is completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace , no matter which race , religion or ide@@ ology have to listen to all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring offerings , because we know nothing is simple . to those who defend life as the basis of existence , many difficulties are im@@ min@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; on our way , there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a trans@@ woman talks about persecutions in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

homosex@@ ual and que@@ er people living in the Caucas@@ us region are exposed to a great range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have experienced the reporting of the last months on the persecution of gay men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but the threat , which is based on the local LGB@@ T@@ Q community , was not only created by night . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experience with us , and talked with us what is happening in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q legal situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines before several months , after reports published , which have been published , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities seeking susp@@ icious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; they brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sabrina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since her childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya was not a safe place for her , why she went to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group had learned from the gender equality of their land , the hunt for Sabrina has been opened . &quot;
they came out of fear for her life in the United States .
Sabrina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ mets on a human rights organisation .
&quot; one day , I told me that someone needed my help . &quot;
&quot; this was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone , from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sp@@ ic@@ iled them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there is no more men in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya who can solve these dis@@ grace ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos taken from my documents by all the What@@ s@@ App took the round . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I had just been doing some shopping cart from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; &quot; here &apos;s a gift for you of your uncle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time for Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya : &quot; how long will you honor the family , you dishon@@ our ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost the consciousness and a@@ woke the last end of the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had taken everything and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man was fled .
the women had called a ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two no@@ oping in my right lung wings . &quot;
OC Media : what health care have you been laid - in men or women ?
&quot; Sabrina : my documents are ob@@ sol@@ ete , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful to him .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Caucas@@ ian name . &quot;
but he turned out as a good man .
I am grateful to him that he was respec@@ t@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , foreigners , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ fall .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; the slow@@ ed to send me back to Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya , to prove that everything was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they described the absurd demands : some told me , I must prove it by passing through the streets ; others wanted me to rise in the official television in Gro@@ z@@ ny , and say that I wasn &apos;t changed my gender , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say in television ?
OC Media : how has your family tried to deal with this pressure ?
Sabrina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some older people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , not only your family , but the whole republic is ashamed . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she put a rope around his neck . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , they came and saved them . &quot;
&quot; at the time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later there stood a car with a dar@@ ken@@ ed window and a license plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I was clear that there was something la@@ zy . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sabrina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something un@@ belief . &quot;
I can &apos;t understand how it could be .
&quot; just before my departure from Moscow , I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived . &quot;
&quot; I bought it without hes@@ itation , without identification , without any identification . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw them in the tr@@ ash .
arrived at and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card to my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by What@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you &apos;re in safety , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ est . you even know your room number . &quot;
just to prove it : it &apos;s the number 115 .
can you imagine this ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sabrina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the gender equality . however , this is a table theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Caucas@@ ian elements .
&quot; as much as I wish it , these se@@ el@@ ic barrier can &apos;t be overcome . &quot;
&quot; I always say that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; if we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person that they are remin@@ ded of their past - so remember my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends do , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sabrina : I filed a report in Washington last week .
for this I needed latest information about the situation in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
I spoke to somebody who had dinner one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ ad@@ an no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ ad@@ an could hardly wait to wait , and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; that I mean , they probably charge the relatives , these are responsible for the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced by blood . &quot;
OC Media : are you also gay men now set up in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sabrina : a friend of me says it was not very many .
&quot; if , especially those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to present the Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they will be held there , so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : should they be killed , they will show their bodies in television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply disappeared , but specifically di@@ pped to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a guess or have you a source for this information ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m reading someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their be@@ ard was grown .
there has been nothing new from them since .
they simply took them away .
&quot; and so called Lord , this person was present themselves when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , until now they were not presented as band@@ its , so far there were no reports so far . we assume that such actions are possible . &quot;
why else could it not allow this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these persec@@ ut@@ ations and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people , who have heard a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , have already took place in the past ? &quot;
Sabrina : I &apos;ve always been wearing my hair long .
in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 I was already very well known , when I was living there - and I never had problems . &quot;
seriously ! in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much more secure than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia was originally intended to bring us back to the civil war , but ultimately led us back to the stone time . &quot;
OC Media : what is it possible with the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sabrina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were bre@@ wed ; I had painted l@@ ashes , wore tube je@@ ans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Security of Sch@@ aria has never dar@@ ed a hair with me .
&quot; before the Russian Theatre in Gro@@ z@@ ny , there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a speech : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that means : &quot; sp@@ ire not about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
&quot; it is often said to children , if people have fun with wre@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : so they simply have their eyes closed before you , because they believed , you are sick ? &quot;
Sabrina : yes .
&quot; they never ins@@ ulting me , never hun@@ ted , and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did these gifts hold on ?
Sabrina : as long as Kad@@ y@@ row occurred to the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed prime minister in 2005 , he began talking about mor@@ ality in television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but primarily about the behavior of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who had laughed and laughed , looked at once with sus@@ pic@@ ion . &quot;
during the time I left Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the republic is steadily growing . &quot;
OC Media : what activity will you go now ?
Sabrina : I &apos;m working as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the United States .
&quot; apart from that , I &apos;m still active as a activist . &quot;
&quot; at present , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I comment with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we perfectly organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , conventi@@ ons , I teach them to hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t leave any cents .
I discovered these people themselves when I ap@@ per@@ ched a curse .
I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ den@@ ab ?
Sabrina : that &apos;s al@@ tim@@ ely .
&quot; thus , nature , that has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same like ch@@ uck@@ les , who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth , that there is no gay ones with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have those who have the cab@@ ar@@ din@@ ers who have the Russians also have ; on the whole planet it is - but not in Che@@ ch@@ n@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , that &apos;s why it is un@@ pleasant to listen to something . &quot;
I meet so many men out of Caucas@@ ia .
many of them - practic@@ ing Muslims in the mosque and during the Ram@@ ad@@ an fa@@ sten - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think of Tran@@ sid@@ ent@@ ity to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a tru@@ ste@@ er . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of emotion , to be exact , different living conditions . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not harm me for my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I &apos;m going to personally personally , but my final intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I myself am myself .
&quot; local groups war@@ n against an increase of self @-@ murder within the pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ Zul@@ i community in Iran , Iran &quot;
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the past few months , there is a strong increase of self @-@ moral . &quot;

&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 , the desper@@ ate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ az@@ i community in Iran , which is influenced by poverty and unemployment , into the spot@@ light . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under Ang@@ st@@ illness , depression , and he was ashamed for his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , who want to join the in@@ ability for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ Zul@@ i human rights groups who are working in Ah@@ wa@@ z and would remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; on YouTube video , a video showed the moments when he ign@@ ited themselves . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to extingu@@ ish the flames immediately , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ eg@@ ger hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ aries were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide not to ex@@ ert itself in August within the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ Zul@@ i minority , and activists war@@ n the place that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; Ah@@ wa@@ az@@ i Centre for Human Rights reported that this month several other - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ b@@ awi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung this month . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : there were all family fathers , who felt safe and in@@ capable due to persecution by the Iranian government , hel@@ pless and unable to pursue their families with safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which a large majority of people living in Iran , was sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to dispute its living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ahl@@ avi monarchy took power in 1925 to stop ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ mad region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields and some of the most sustainable and most valuable areas of agricultural farming . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , regional economy continues to slow down only , and the native population gets only little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of un@@ treated diseases , hunger and de@@ be@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; Iranian regime has been denied by Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i Arabs systematically in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a multitude of dem@@ men who lie waters of the Arab areas in the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ oma are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dem@@ on have only managed to destroy the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness caused devast@@ ation , and the local agriculture , as well as the fish and palm @-@ trees industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate below the Arab A@@ Hawai@@ ian young@@ sters rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director for Co@@ oper@@ atives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who seek a job to termin@@ ate the primary school , 55 % completed a secondary school and 45 % completed a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... aimed to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ az@@ i human rights activist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , leads to a &quot; high increase &quot; the number of self @-@ moral among young Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially the unemployment has become worse , the reason for this is a combination of a high number of people in Ah@@ mad ethnic Persian and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the setting process : &quot;
&quot; as officials and institutions do not prefer@@ ring Arab labor force , the local Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i will continue access to work opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and to force her living outside of her homeland Ah@@ mad . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to hide their ancest@@ or and sur@@ names to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i , because even Arab names are not toler@@ ated in the workplace , because the speaking of Arabic language or the traditional Arab clothes are not toler@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ w@@ az@@ i have to endure , they propose human rights activists , before the situation explo@@ sively . &quot;
&quot; it remains to wait , whether the world is w@@ aking up and knowing . &quot;
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
&quot; depression is treat@@ able and committed , avo@@ id@@ able . &quot;

they even rehear@@ sed scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a femin@@ ist and why we generally should be a femin@@ ist * inside .
&quot; for example , that women may still earn less money in the same education as men . &quot;
&quot; that women are still under strict observation , if it is about what they are to do with their body . &quot;
violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life to a gl@@ ac@@ ne blanket , and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced of that and I suffer double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , when I come to skin color on black women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ IQ @-@ community or black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I consider how we are physically ab@@ used in the LGB@@ T community or in black women , many white femin@@ ists decide to hold many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; however , they all agree that women - all women should come together to take up their voices , and &apos; Kum@@ b@@ aya , my Lord &apos; to sing &quot; to sing equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it in addition to sexu@@ alised violence a institutional form of assi@@ mil@@ dly motivated violence , which we are subject to black women in two times . &quot;
or above that black women and women may benefit from other eth@@ nic@@ ities and high@@ ways less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school , as a white girl , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black sp@@ ouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk , domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and ever any skin color have the same rights ; on the other hand , I can &apos;t connect to a movement whose center is the white woman who ref@@ uses to refer to in@@ justice in their mind as well as to the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and won &apos;t be strug@@ gling to fight my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ femin@@ ist sp@@ ouses who always and countless other black women always have rejected .
&quot; so@@ jour@@ ner committed suicide in 1851 in their speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain a ide@@ ology , in which the black woman is a human and mar@@ g@@ inal beings . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join me group , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to promote their eg@@ o@@ centr@@ alized program . &quot;
&quot; I will not try to learn white women the importance of the over@@ l@@ apping of skin color and gender . because some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for the femin@@ ist movement , no matter how many black women are attemp@@ ting to honor them . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ medi@@ al femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different approaches a home and ren@@ ounce itself from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is in his name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to get rid of myself full and full of femin@@ ism , which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman , instead of using me for a white @-@ femin@@ ist para@@ dig@@ m , which is so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly celebrated that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a new phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now , it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and engage us into the spher@@ es which we created for us . &quot;
Cl@@ en@@ ora Hudson @-@ We@@ ems who define the author of the book Afri@@ c@@ ana wom@@ an@@ ism : recall that we can defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be rever@@ ed , which make up the black women . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately call separ@@ at@@ ism and exclusion , after reading these lines , I ask you about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradic@@ tions of femin@@ ist movement , of which the black women is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ red environment , I can claim black women and women from other cultures , because in this para@@ dig@@ m exist . &quot;
&quot; due to my dark skin and because of my existence , I recognized as a part of this para@@ dig@@ m . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life doesn &apos;t survive , nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man who protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports in@@ special about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement , this article will be re @-@ published here . &quot;
&quot; ever again , Nabil Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with surf board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region of Iraq . his mission aims to develop the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , we follow Mus@@ a , who declared to us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its church . &quot;
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child , &quot; said Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fears that the decades of war , the construction of reservoir , pollution and un@@ controlled development , lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organisation Water@@ ke@@ epers Iraq - a subsidiary of Water@@ proof Alliance - which is committed to protect the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summar@@ ises the pressures and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water anymore , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was filmed and produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the emphasis on their work is followed , little noticeable sub@@ cultures and distingu@@ ishes itself through the use of co@@ oper@@ ative video photography and new multimedia techniques , with their help to tell their stories , their stories can tell their story . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and worked version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by tur@@ ally . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # soft eg@@ g@@ inity ) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay .
most names were changed to protect persons affected .
&quot; A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez said that she could not do anything against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex partner , who could have been active as for@@ cible . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police , her statement would not be laid , but more could you do . &quot;
&quot; when another wife Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed nothing due to abuse , the ac@@ claimed ad@@ vert of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second wife moved away their ad@@ vert . &quot;
the v@@ icious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women are allowed to display at any time , they do not receive assistance from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , the women are also fin@@ anci@@ ally dependent on men who abuse them . this explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to admit victims of violence in general , in law en@@ forcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; In@@ vol@@ 1 stro@@ kes and Statist@@ ic 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that has nothing sub@@ ter@@ t@@ 3 of the laws : good approach , lacking implementation hit and st@@ ats &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to determine how many women can really be mi@@ stre@@ amed , says My@@ rian Gonz@@ Ã¡@@ lez , a social scientific research institute in Paraguay . &quot; there are different information and reports , which show not even a sat@@ in @-@ the magn@@ itude of gender violence against women in Paraguay , &quot; explains them . &quot;
these figures have to be al@@ ar@@ ming however .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District Office of At@@ tor@@ ney General , there were 9@@ 600 ads for domestic violence . 70 % of them went to violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads come from women .
there were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace dishes . 86 % of the ads attended by women .
&quot; in the advertisement , 40 % of women said they were physically har@@ assed , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di are only given a few of those off@@ ences in fact . &quot; on each woman , who will not be ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , there are 9 women who do not . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2014 , two women who do not do this will be ref@@ unded on every woman who does not do this , &quot; declared at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay has no own off@@ ences , prosec@@ utions authorities cannot be documented , as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country . &quot;
&quot; the Coordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible Mis@@ ab@@ uses and a legal system that doesn &apos;t under@@ takes anything
&quot; before Mariana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , however , however , however . this should always repent . &quot;
&quot; today , Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psych@@ ic violence against women , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time . &quot;
I have never thought that I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier this , I always thought that the only women had happened that they are subject to violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen to me .
Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name , she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his ins@@ ults and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he isolated them . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos itself . he asked rh@@ et@@ oric , whether he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mariana , why they had fallen that so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost like that , when they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least some complic@@ ity in it . &quot;
&quot; Victoria Santos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , to prove that their former partner she mi@@ stre@@ ated her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women all in any way victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can speak with others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take statements on women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
&quot; finally , her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it initiated a process against their former partner who developed into an un@@ search@@ able legal conflict between Paraguay and its home country , where it mainly went for money , power and the influence of their former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay Law : good approach , def@@ icient implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws which are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the ab@@ uses of ab@@ uses is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; says Victoria Santos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a draft law was discussed under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ e@@ j ( # FÃ¼r@@ sten@@ ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and movement # Ni@@ sym@@ Men@@ os ( # non @-@ L@@ ess ) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law looks to explain Fem@@ izi@@ d into an independent crime @-@ continu@@ ance and harder to pun@@ ish as it is in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legisl@@ ature has changed in some points , in order to win the MPs for the Law , that &apos;s the way to de@@ crimin@@ alizes the de@@ crimin@@ alization of abor@@ tions , which are generally banned in Paraguay up to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original bill had provided , the majority of the ( bureaucr@@ atic and economic ) travel costs which have to bear the victims of violence at present themselves if they simply want to maintain and maintain a safe housing to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argu@@ ed that the law is not effective , if the legisl@@ ature is unable to provide sufficient financial resources for this purpose : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is seen as part of the human relationship . &quot;
&quot; here , a circum@@ stance will take place , that violence is no longer considered a bit of standards . &quot;
&quot; who , in view of these facts , makes it guilty and we@@ ars the perpet@@ r@@ ator of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
we have to restore so long ad that is no longer valid until fail@@ ing is not considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law had been changed . among other things , a passage that the partners were forced to reconc@@ ile the partners in cases of domestic violence . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
&quot; the section regarding the reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for aggression , to attack his victims . &quot;
&quot; however , the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political power &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is considered a great set@@ back . &quot;

&quot; a year , independent media in Oman a year after the ban of a newspaper remain ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; this website has been locked out due to a resolution of the information of the information &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than one year ago , the om@@ ani authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n due to their reporting on corruption in the s@@ ult@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison where he served a year sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and tried again later , but later was freed . &quot;
&quot; since 1970 , Oman has ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn , who came to power after he had de@@ posed his father , Said , i@@ bn T@@ aim@@ ur . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important branches in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defense , Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces , Minister of Ministers , Minister of the Supreme Council for the planning and president of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sultan is characterized by the efforts of security forces , especially of domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , public fre@@ ed@@ oms , including press freedom , restri@@ cting and rights activists , independent journalists , blog@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitim@@ ate activities in the area of human rights systematically and hin@@ der citizens , also activists , remember their views on public matters of country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and detention three of their editors last year is a hard blow for press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper in which since its founding in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) was reported until it was forbidden by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on July 28 , 2016 , security forces Ibrahim Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , was issued an article entitled &quot; &quot; Hoch@@ ran@@ ty parties into the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; it went to corruption in the Ju@@ di@@ ality and the interference of high @-@ ranking officials in court decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials accused the judge of the Supreme Court in Oman under pressure to raise a verdict in an inheritance . &quot;
&quot; issue of the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level Parties shall bind hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a member of the Executive Committee , was charged at the ISS before the special department and was arrested by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS received the Deputy Chief Editor of You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who had been managing director of Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed on a definite period after the Information Minister had given the directive that &quot; the publication and dis@@ sem@@ ination of the newspaper on any way , including online , as of August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial before the Court took place in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the Court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closing of the newspaper .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convicted of the disorder of the public order &quot; and &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the state . &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of an infr@@ in@@ gement of an audience and sl@@ ander for guilty .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to three years of prison and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 Caucas@@ ian Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . he was also charged with a one @-@ year professional ban against the two journalists .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 2600 US dollars ) after making use of an information network to spread material that could be found guilty of public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , there was a deposit in the amount of 5000 om@@ ic Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appeal Court acquitted Al @-@ Abram &apos;s extradition hearing on 26 December 2016 , but Al @-@ Ha@@ j sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 following the restoration of his six @-@ month prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ cat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his sentence in prison .
the Appeal Court also turned the decision of the Information Ministry to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to allow Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper seems to be exposed to attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Information Minister issued a statement with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Information Minister personally signed a further statement , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , with which the Minister set up another time against the decision of the Appeals Court , the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
&quot; the constant closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases where in Oman at the youngest time , freedom of press was injured . &quot;
&quot; for further injuries , for example , the closure of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ in and the exercising of pressure on al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to enter their operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the prolonged closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the imprisoned journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression is that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to prepare an end to the vast violation of the press freedom . &quot;
Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights and G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the public authorities to :
1 . You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately release and unconditional surrender ;
&quot; 2 . to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3. to protect the press freedom in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights advoc@@ acy and journalists in Oman their righ@@ t@@ ful human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered , and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judicial ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organisation , including independent journalists , blog@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and the right to gather access to peace@@ fully , supporting and providing them protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture takes place with his consent &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely rare or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; for the need for medical research , there are two reasons : for a lack of medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical demand on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuberculosis and malaria have increasingly severe effects in the poorest countries as elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases by pharmaceutical companies have a great problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , in order to establish its own research capacities in Africa . a major role in science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is director of the Centre for the research of infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was first focused on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for studying in the United States , initially in Louisiana , later in Indiana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania , he studied the HIV @-@ virus , before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ b@@ ische healthcare system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions of the media about this research . &quot;
( Dis@@ claim@@ er : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research theme ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ b@@ ische national programme for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; I also launch a research program for developing molecular diagnosis tests for HIV , TB , and other relevant path@@ o@@ gens . &quot;
g@@ v : what are your opinion about the most important scientific topics in your country and in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise , we will always be recei@@ vers instead of being M@@ acher . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is impossible to use them here . &quot;
g@@ v : where does finance and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is to find appropriate scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or draw here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : what is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work that you didn &apos;t have before ?
RW : the basic infrastructure does not comply with the standards in developed countries . it costs much money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import from other countries . &quot;
g@@ v : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there are already interest but only a very limited understanding of science methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods were taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; g@@ v : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should they focus on and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all age classes .
&quot; there are need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , investig@@ ating world trau@@ ma , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and cont@@ ag@@ ious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it . &quot;
g@@ v : can you describe the advantages and dis@@ advantages of life as scientists in Africa across western countries - based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often it &apos;s limited speed to do things , and the overwhelming access to scientific expertise that are shown here . &quot;
&quot; the system , that magazines are only accessible to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports about solvents worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on had been dancing in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties such as out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA @-@ Astron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; almost 20 years of work , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was made only by its own income and the question how many salads ... he can get limits . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use the bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special rot@@ or or green leaf . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereals or cardboard . due to this trends , plant bre@@ eders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia of old tradition , Mort@@ on still uses salad , however it takes longer when his work is increasingly difficult for ever since its work . &quot;
&quot; it is , as if a rock lie in a river , in order to make the bl@@ unt . &quot;
&quot; so we have to do this now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents are going to go far too far . &quot;
&quot; and if they stick to judgment , no one can breed a new salads , because all characteristics are already patented . so it &apos;s so good as possible and tries to extract those features that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to use no material , which is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement , which is growing in the USA and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; -@@ bre@@ edings ) . &quot;
ast@@ ron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have produced red skirts of the variety out@@ red@@ dish in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; plant &quot; of the station . there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that , as if the movement from the IT area would come and not from the area of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software to provide alternatives to copyright @-@ protected software .
&quot; it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property , and so for plant bre@@ eders are usable . &quot;
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , U.S. bre@@ eder can also under@@ take that others may be able to use far@@ med fruit well . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; bre@@ eders allow only others to breeding their seed , and it is not immediately infl@@ amed - two aspects which are forbidden by many plant pat@@ rons . &quot;
dozens of bre@@ eders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
dark outlook
&quot; Professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Madison and O@@ ss@@ i board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg are control of the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants , both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to him , it plays a role in larger associations such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent bre@@ eders would try to try the latter not or only little to use the seed with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg st@@ resses that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified plants . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , we need control of organic farming or not . &quot; to buy our goal of ecological sustainability , such as it may be offered on farms in the global agricultural industry , so it should also know that the way is bred on farms as such as this vegetables is bred . &quot;

&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supp@@ orter argue that the future of food supplies are threatened , since the available Gen@@ pool due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights in plant material , which is therefore always limited to be reduced . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , a Director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability . she found out that about one @-@ third of all cardboard features is protected as intellectual property , which is either us@@ eless for plant bre@@ eders . &quot;
&quot; for other plants , such estimates do not exist , but experts like Lu@@ by susp@@ ect that mass@@ en@@ sely inn@@ ed plants like wheat in even greater style patented are as let@@ tu@@ ce or carrots . &quot;
a question of visibility
&quot; plants will be so bred that they are targeted characteristic features - of such , as their taste or their color improves , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments such as p@@ ests and diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents based on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for bre@@ eders is steadily decreasing . genetic diversity is currently more constra@@ ined than ever since the changed conditions are predic@@ table much worse by climate change . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spre@@ ader Car@@ ly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to know that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States , the company set itself for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , in fact , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property including other bre@@ eders , as &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties innovations promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan which everyone can follow once the patent has expired . &quot;
&quot; often , these instructions help others to get the same result with another method . &quot;
&quot; this means that such protection does not in@@ hib@@ its innovations , but promotes them by making more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years waiting until a patent exp@@ elling , certainly does not have any innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for so long to breed plants , which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one could have lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources still have been a general public , and there should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant bre@@ eders have neither the time nor the money for such form@@ alities , and monetary inc@@ enti@@ ves are not attractive for us . &quot;
we want to make farmers easier .
&quot; that is what we drive us , and it is impossible to use us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept to examine plant features : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics . &quot;
&quot; plants form themselves , and as bre@@ eders , we have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a mystery of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol Dep@@ pe , plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and O@@ ss@@ i board member , there is another important aspect of the plant breeding : &quot; who is breeding a variety , also breeding his own values into it . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ oc@@ ul@@ tures , for which cultiv@@ ates are necessary her@@ b@@ icides , breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just gent@@ leman . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets but smaller than e.g. Mon@@ san@@ to are ) patents , there are most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either do they reject the patented , or they are not worthwhile or both in the case . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on is searching for an independent plant garden Sal@@ ate .
photograph of Karen Mort@@ on .
&quot; Mort@@ on is also the view that bre@@ eders through avo@@ idance of plant pat@@ ron@@ ics would say : &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that patented . &quot;
&quot; I need a lot of new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years even , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is 20 years ahead of competition , with which you simply make it very nice . &quot; worldwide reson@@ ance &quot;
&quot; although the USA seem to be a leader in the &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding , the concept has now spread rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources , is an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed program . &quot; for obtain@@ ing the seed of traditional plant veget@@ arians , the centre is working together with farmers and helps them meet new varieties . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell her own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an &quot; open source &quot; license which , ultimately , is a formal and legally binding form of the O@@ ss@@ i commitment to bre@@ eders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( rules for bre@@ eders differ from land to land , absent for O@@ ss@@ i commitment not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , states that the conventi@@ onally @-@ bred plants should not be patented . thus , she talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office , the patents on conventi@@ onally cultivated plants . &quot;
&quot; however , a statement is not yet a law ; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the patent offices to this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization H@@ iv@@ os organized a conference entitled &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , to farmers , operators and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and global trend to investigate seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for H@@ iv@@ os &apos;s programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed , states that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed @-@ ben@@ ches , for which the next year the official start should be dropped . &quot;
&quot; a combination of environmental protection and development groups ( including H@@ iv@@ os , the international non @-@ profit aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , technology and concentration - Action Group on ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of eating - a consortium of aid organisations like the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - have published a report . in this , she represents the opportunity to exchange and improve and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply with food @-@ food . &quot;
&quot; in the report , the importance of a varied , local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphas@@ ises - a connection between the Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes to recognize it soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has been respected above all , where and how little is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , so Lu@@ by . &quot; we are trying to make people clear@@ er that there is still more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the newest goals of c@@ ens@@ orship in Egypt
still un@@ locking the Egyptian government content on the Internet .
this time it sur@@ passed the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a column .
&quot; on the weekend of August 5 , the Egyptian government closed the website of the &quot; Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights ab@@ uses in Egypt and the Arab world , and reported on that . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook where it critic@@ ised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Universal Network for Human Rights Information Wa@@ it - despite this attack and the constitution of Egyptian law and the Constitution to defend this goal , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I , even though it was never so difficult to overcome them , so it was never so important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I was able to overcome all technical possibilities to overcome the blocking , and not afterwards . we hope to keep our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first licensed site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabian language of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jazeera network for &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of web site lock@@ out for victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the key data sources for human rights in Arabic language htt@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ HR@@ I , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and Human Rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada is no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took his blog for the spread of colum@@ ni@@ es and articles he writes in Egypt &apos;s non @-@ access websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he set up in order to circum@@ vent the Z@@ ens@@ ur@@ rection of the Egyptian government , even target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , which is home to the Zi@@ adas blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video how the police reported physical violence against two students . &quot;
his article turn mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook commentary , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking due to the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , but has a priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ att@@ ah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaning@@ less for the world , so it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It happened to them to give me the feeling of a siege to mediate , an attempted murder , an attempted murder , re@@ loading of the national Security Council , the blocking blogs , as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You demonstrated that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , if only in a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I took it to the post of articles to b@@ ypass the c@@ ens@@ orship .
&quot; however , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the Mu@@ ch walks through the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( AF@@ TE ) the Egyptian authorities closed from May 24 to August 06 . 133 websites . this showed technical tests on the networks of various internet service providers ( IS@@ P ) , including orange , Vo@@ da@@ fone and Et@@ is@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; also , AF@@ TE also documented the blocking of providers due to the transition of internet c@@ ens@@ orship and private surfing , called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
&quot; such a practice suggests , focusing on the intention of the government , continue to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users could have access . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the situation is intensi@@ fied , that the interest decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis in which they can proceed in court against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with c@@ ens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
fighting the inhabitants .

&quot; day for day reports newspapers in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard illustrations . &quot;
some of these lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school shot , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro was assassin@@ ated , &quot; &quot; Die@@ be rau@@ ben &apos;s pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ an sends 8500 soldiers of the army , marine and air@@ af@@ ee to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ang@@ ed financial situation , the violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called the United Nations to interv@@ ene .
reports such as these are everyday and this is un@@ acceptable &amp; # 8@@ 212 ; at least the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio known newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; on 16th August , the Editorial &quot; That is not normal , &quot; in which they arrived to setting a new column called &quot; war in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the moti@@ ves for their decision explained the newspaper :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in any major city on the world as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexu@@ al@@ ings , etc . everything , but what happened in Rio , will be published in the &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : that &apos;s not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative if we don &apos;t close our eyes in front of the cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , Chief Editor of the newspaper , that this decision was no occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper in the whole world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that did not recognise the war .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist wrote that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , 8@@ 43 areas there are areas of criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the Editorial , the newspaper writes : &quot;
&quot; we realize that a war dis@@ course , if it is dist@@ orted , too , can also be used , atro@@ cities of the police , which only fl@@ ushes and then asks questions to be confused . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose goal is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Mafia and their partner . &quot;
does the name &quot; war &quot; more than they use it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bras@@ il , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argu@@ ed that violence as &quot; war &quot; refers to a just@@ ification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it harder to rule the responsibility of the police . &quot;
this is no war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and worse planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with in@@ sufficient investment in personnel , enlighten@@ ment and a historical and sel@@ f@@ ences of the public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than only its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro , is false : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and north @-@ east of the country . these are the latest available data . &quot;
&quot; none of these cities are in the state of Rio de Janeiro , Rio de Janeiro . &quot;

&quot; in addition to these safety policy measures , the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia Paci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the Federal State of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to capture a fav@@ ela of police and deplo@@ ying a unit permanently . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this resulted in a decrease of for@@ cible deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP was to protect against the poor churches and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor churches which should protect the curious police unit , increasingly under fire . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux was quoted from one of his articles from 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio do not comply with the term &quot; civil war &quot; by the Geneva Convention . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio is also serious consequences for human beings . &quot;
&quot; for this calls on the state to use resources and ways that are typical for war . this is the penetration of a &quot; enemy &quot; territory , where a civil war is a non @-@ sharp point in the landscape and the object for &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; and &quot; ir@@ resi@@ zed spher@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ el@@ as are still suffering in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week , it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ u@@ cin@@ ho police to pay the death of a polic@@ emen . &quot;

to stay alive : besie@@ ged Syrians to plant mushrooms
screenshot out of the promotional video .
source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the following civil war , many Syrian cities suffer for brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; according to victories , a joint initiative of the Peace Organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , are located in Damascus and Um@@ land , Homs , D@@ eir ez and Id@@ li@@ b about one million Syrians in a state of the siege . &quot;
&quot; the region of East G@@ hou@@ ta , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 is affected by hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre of the Assad regime was carried out . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these territories have been under siege of controlled areas outside of Damascus , which led them to local or through tun@@ nels and control points of gu@@ ile foods . &quot;
&quot; due to the lon@@ gl@@ ands block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat has become un@@ att@@ ain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ part , a group of Syrian humanitarian aid and ac@@ adem@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; li@@ fel@@ ine food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ am@@ da and perform the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional crops , in Syria , and are only extremely rare part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes it an attractive food source for many indigenous people of besie@@ ged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; direct to the project , subscription Nabil , said to the French news agency AFP : &quot;
&quot; we opted for cultivation of mushrooms because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant it in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed L@@ eila , one of the organis@@ ers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that this project has been fighting for three years and pressed his relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , use the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ as , as the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to provide 125 families of knowledge to plant fung@@ i , so Dr. L@@ eila to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article they reached over 100 % of their expected target of about 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do from Monday , 04 September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is based on generators , which keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity of 80 % . &quot;
&quot; due to fuel short@@ ages , locally manufactured greenhouse gases are used in plastic to supply generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. L@@ eila said Global Vo@@ ices , that they began with the &quot; production from the regions of fung@@ al seeds , &quot; before they checked their quality , and if they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms anywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
Dr. L@@ eila explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; we want to teach people the fung@@ al breeding for various reasons , &quot; The breach of the siege . &quot;

&quot; creation of new jobs for people with disabilities , which are tied to their home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea in the whole world , so our success and our fight against hunger and siege is visible . &quot;
&quot; we want our experience to people in conflict areas , and we can help mankind . &quot;

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of capit@@ als in Portugal and sought justice for the victims of fires that gr@@ assi@@ oned in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; two and forty @-@ two persons died , and approximately 70 were injured as a result of the forest fires between 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week from solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gal@@ icia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 cre@@ ators , which spread themselves in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forestry monitoring system that the forest areas were monitored by satellite photos , in 2017 alone about 500,000 acres of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the serious situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .

the aim of the protests from Saturday was the call for a better pre@@ emp@@ tive and fire fighting measures .
people questioned why the civilian protection was not able to en@@ c@@ ate the extent of the tragedy as far as possible .
JoÃ£o So@@ ver@@ al from the federal government of farmers in Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages have been evacu@@ ated . &quot;
this Sunday they did this n@@ somewhere : there are dozens of open roads which were enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could happen in June , since the streets were very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits will be prevented with high bran@@ dr@@ is@@ iko . &quot;
&quot; a far reaching proposal on the whale @-@ form , which had brought the government after serious fires in the years 2003 and 2005 , was transferred from the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obst@@ acle for investments . &quot;
&quot; the government led to the conduct of the law , which allowed the case of case that the applicant had a case to self protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val carries on the same article in the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organisation Quer@@ cus made sure that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of light @-@ flamm@@ able wood , turned out as in a v@@ icious circle , according to fires of that kind . &quot;
&quot; these issues were added that the website of the civil protection from Portugal on 15 and 16 October , seeking information , sought or tried to contact relatives . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used the own civil protection data using the application f@@ og@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time over the site and the spread of fires .
&quot; the project was founded in 2015 by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina in order to simpli@@ fy the work of the Fire Brigade , so that the servers pursued the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400,000 users who followed fires , not counted : there were more than half a million people . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in one night in the autumn of 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began with the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years before , a terrible civil war broke out between the various mu@@ ja@@ he@@ din groups that had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . in this way , Afghanistan had become a country of terror and desp@@ air . &quot;
&quot; at this time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati sat , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t talk about it then , she knew she would no longer see her son - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was breaking up . &quot;
his uncle would pick him up and bring him to the lock .

&quot; Abdul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the leader of Haz@@ ara dominated party He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat was killed just by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt rel@@ essly . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , which were known for her hatred , came in closer to the Haz@@ ara . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; some days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a co@@ h@@ let . the work was heavy and made him sick .
&quot; then he took that which was left out of his low wages , and went in Iran . once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and to@@ wed sacks with mort@@ ars , which were heavier than he himself to earn their living . &quot;
&quot; back then , in Iran &apos;s life was shaped by mis@@ ery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site , on which we worked . &quot;
there were no facilities there and no heating . we hung nylon before the open window , so that we can &apos;t freeze at night . &quot;
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without Pap@@ ers in Iran and ready for the journey to Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the dangerous crossing on the sea he suffered ship@@ wreck and ran on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time was A@@ shar@@ af ob@@ el@@ essly , ran alone through the streets of Rome , asleep in parks and went to a church , which distributed twice a day meal in need in need . &quot;
&quot; true that Italy is a kind of second chance for ref@@ unded asylum seek@@ ers . however , it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seek@@ ers can be found in the country is dis@@ astro@@ us . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
the vast majority of asylum seek@@ ers will be accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; it is an impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel .
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seek@@ ers can only be allocated to a reception center if they officially opened an application for asylum - which can still be requested for the registration of the asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; until then there are people who have no money to accommodation , either on the hospitality of friends or need to sleep on the streets . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his immort@@ alized lifestyle helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af had his entire savings to the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this ran so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a snap@@ shot .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ at@@ is success story is now on the theme of the &quot; Behin@@ d Venice Luxury , a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a trans@@ itional solution on the road to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans managed companies , including ten@@ der@@ ies , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ mad@@ i had the idea of his restaurant Orient experience , where the wa@@ iter and the kitchen staff mostly refugees from different parts of the world are . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells us through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes the history of their journey to Italy . &quot;
the Afghan entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a Sushi Restaurant in Rome are also available .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims to go beyond the Italian Wine industry and retail trade and aim back to the country , which he had to leave a teen@@ ager as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; I never forget my country , and I cannot live happy if I know my people suffers . &quot;
I plan a project for farmers from the country &apos;s poorest provinces especially for women .
they represent half of society and need to get the same possibilities like all others .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also decor@@ ates plans for the opening of a factory in Kabul , where people can learn packing and preservatives . &quot; &quot; they can improve their appointment in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of a successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through un@@ certainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
A@@ shar@@ af made this journey itself . now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path .

the Egyptian Parliament exam@@ ines a bill to determine that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency .
&quot; users had to use to use the social networks in order to register their social networks , register within six months after the successful legisl@@ ature on the website of the authority under the explanation of their full name and its ID number . &quot;
&quot; whoever ref@@ uses this step , could be sentenced to six months in prison or the termination of a pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently deb@@ ated to the legislative and constitutional Committee of Parliament . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of the legisl@@ ature filed a law@@ suit in which harder pen@@ alties for the ins@@ ult of the President or a high officials would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the off@@ ence of the President as well as a state agent is already stra@@ ined . under the bill , such a matter , however , would be pen@@ dic@@ ated with prison and fin@@ es , as right of Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this may mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would be a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud _ Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he demonstrated Egyptian polic@@ emen , who had led opposition to protest@@ ers who had led the military coup of the elected president Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 protest@@ ers who had been arrested during the same incident was arrested for four years in prison on a court date . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was post@@ pon@@ ed on the 20th of May , because the prison line would not fail because of human rights groups , def@@ ending the def@@ endants from prison to the Court &apos;s room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups embar@@ r@@ assed , ruling load of among others arms ownership , illeg@@ itim@@ ate assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal court in G@@ iza was free of two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their reporting to pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya in Cairo .
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalist Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mustafa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who also were arrested for the previous incident , 25 years ago . &quot;
tun@@ ic activists listening to le@@ av@@ ed documents
&quot; we spent six hours with the stop of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia is mainly li@@ stens to a le@@ aked action plan , which according to the plan explicitly endor@@ sed a controversial bill of bill , which according to the plan expressly acc@@ use by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption . official am@@ nesty would be provided . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , raises a light on how the pre@@ stige plans for the support of the legisl@@ ature will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia , refused to nomin@@ ate the nam@@ ing of his sources , referring to Article 11 of the Tunis@@ ian press de@@ xes that journalists con@@ sec@@ ures the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he joined the district court in Tunis on 9 May as a witness . &quot;
will China comp@@ el the users of social media to present their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users need social media in China to write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the registration will be required for registration with the full re@@ generative name . &quot;
analysts assume that the Eli@@ mination of anonymous comments should be reached within social networks . it is un@@ clear until now how the authorities will apply these regulations .
&quot; Chinese networks have suggested to social media in the social media , these regulations have only been sel@@ ective to protect the civil journ@@ alism and its independence . &quot;
do we see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
may the state c@@ ens@@ orship from Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat .
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat sent to register at the state government as &quot; organizer of the information common . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this designation is part of a bill from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government conduc@@ ts a list of online services , which allows the &quot; publication of information &quot; to make responsible services responsible for removing contents , and to force them on request to request users . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently belong to websites like V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ z@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2,@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court disp@@ at@@ ched the blocking Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administ@@ rators refused to extingu@@ ish two in English articles , the figures , Turkey supp@@ oses the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Marine Affairs and Communication admitted that the site was blocked because they collabor@@ ate with &quot; an information source that collabor@@ ates with groups to promote a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey is blocked the website completely . it is thus , besides China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can not stop fighting her@@ b@@ ating
&quot; after this week , in the middle of a deliber@@ ate consultations , the government is in the midst of a deliber@@ ate surveillance auth@@ orization to force the Internet service providers to monitor communications in real @-@ time monitoring and back@@ pack programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government cons@@ ul@@ ted telecommunications company and intelligence services regarding the proposal , however , has left other technology companies and civilian population . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be for@@ warded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
