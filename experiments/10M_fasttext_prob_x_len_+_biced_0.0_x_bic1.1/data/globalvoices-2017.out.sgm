<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love to America is extremely large.</seg>
<seg id="4">"how many of my generation I grew up with American movies, I have dancing at American music, read American authors and operated his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had an incredibly profound effect on me that I was mainly because of an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless journalist, who, with the help of Julia Roberts as a Jura student, was the Supreme Court of Justice with judges who had his interest inclined."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," I was it, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year, which I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the United States."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," "America is the only country where I ever lived, its diversity is so inviting, that you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of equal people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had a very small love letter concerning his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">A lot has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me, as he goes with his narrow-minded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he never stops on the mountain, as one says so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he considers, as a former colleague said it, and publicly declared his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African American and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his testimony and agreed in droves for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes, which he won with the Republican presidential election, was the highest number hit by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">Who are the Americans who support this bigot person I asked me?</seg>
<seg id="21">"I was able to get Trump and his electors, not to bring people in harmony with the people I met during my time in Phoenix."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism program, bringing people out of all over the world, a deeply believing man with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps also voted World Heritage Lecture with Peter Bhatia, the editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer, "the present editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours to see the "Phoenix Suns" in the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"trumps intolerance also stands in contrast to generosity which I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought for their lives in the environment, and her husband Dave, my family of family who did me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits the Commitment of Kristi Kappes, who helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and my colleagues helped us to gain the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then Andrew Leckey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors who helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and those embodied by them are deepened my love to America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a halt and the equivalent of its limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 over 50 million Americans stated that white, the Presidency of a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the idea of the idea that people had voted for Trump because they shared either his racism and fanatism, or because they were willing to overlooked these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the ump-voters as rassists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to arrange people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficially and respectless and indicates an inability to understand those who act on a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears are not taken into consideration beyond the hectic changes in their communities.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of whom most know are, for Trump, because they want to regain control over a country that she has disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"but one can hardly forget the words of David Remedy, who comments the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down with contempt on those who look differently than he."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(Anm.).: as much as" Rejection of the White against all other ethnicities "; the word of white in order to the White and Whiplash, which means that great Van Jones, has exactly that which America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world value the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - what faith or background can always have, America is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as his presidents, twice the son of a Kenyan, whose story, as he himself says, nowhere else were possible in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the vote Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of white's America's promise and says: to hell with complexity, religious freedom, and the full term of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America, after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the rest, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"at all this, I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who was in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word change with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, could my son, captain Humayun Kahn, could have a place in your America?" Mr Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" breaks the crowd.</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no! they cried, and their voices were louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone who is not so is like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NEIN."</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is that not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son was fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">This is now Trumps Land.</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find no place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart to me.</seg>

<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that targeted over international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The publication happens within the context of an agreement with Global Voices for common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already been operating in Liberia waters on illegal fishing before it was found on the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were raised correspondingly and little inclined to welcome a barrage of this species to their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles of mobilised rapidly against the ship. they refused to eat one of their ports and refused to give him a fisherman permission."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the Prime Minister surrounded by countries who simply refused everything," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, an executive employee of the Kenyan Fisheries Agency. it is part of a team that discovered the ship at the time and followed."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was driven out of the waters of the region: it didn't manage to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillaging the country's pillaging."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, the criminal practices crosses and protects resources, FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal fishing (stop Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, members of this network are the six countries that were expelled from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" we have eight countries that are insolitary and work together. they exchange information and stand each other at where it's illegal fishing "," says Tony Long, Head of Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending illegal fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden since it is extremely difficult to tap it. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing region."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by deliberate disregard of existing laws, which are supposed to be protected by certain habitats and types, illegal fishing ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"however, during actions against illegal fishing once and through bureaucratic obstacles were impaired, and also by the snowckentempo, with the information between different countries, these actions occur in real-time, traceable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the individual countries, for example, can exchange lists existing licenses, news for suspicious activity or details that you notice or experienced during a harbour inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i tracks the activities of ships also very attentive, when they move on the open lake, via satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this enables the authorities to identify ships which fish in banned areas - such as suspicious driving grooves - such that indicate that a ship loads his caught fish on other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the involved ships have a catch license where they were on the way and possibly whether they have a criminal."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can be found on the basis of this information, which means that the ships can not be sold in their ports. and that they could not be forced to sell their charge, as in the case of the Premier."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about significant financial losses for the owner, which means illegal fishing is not worthwhile anymore."</seg>
<seg id="118">"and that is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Chief Executive director of NFDS Africa. the latter is an enforcement company which is committed to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already known platform was created to win an estimated 20 million USD in lost sales, which lose eight members of the HISH-i network every year due to the Illegal fishermen that invade in East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing companies, which attracts the region of commercial fishing from all over the world. under these also illegal fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="122">"among others, actions include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license documents, inscription of Phantasenamen, the fish protected species and the fish in protected areas."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they are targeted to use the lack of international cooperation and make the weaknesses of a non-bridge organized control system," "says Long." "formerly a ship could be fishing and a country could say 'You must not run my port."</seg>
<seg id="124">But another country could say 'Come to me'. 'and precisely this legale gorges tries to close FISH-i now.</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its foundation, FISH-i participated in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks, which had spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships which used several fraudulent identities, and it has found some winged ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international agency for fighting crimes, FISH-i can share information on illegal fishing via large distances and preserved."</seg>
<seg id="129">"some of our investigations lead us fairly well to the networks of organised crime," says Bergh. "</seg>
<seg id="130">"it builds a system, which aims to help FISH-i suspects the suspicious ships of precise."</seg>

<seg id="132">Fish-i's satellite system that will always be developed and also helps to cover illegal ships to hide themselves.</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the Illegal fishermen use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, Master analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, a NRO with fisheries data and FISH-i support technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"for example, some of the ships will switch off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be used by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system that combines different information levels together. it should help FISH-i to find criminating ships with larger precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations have influence on the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes it."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the platform Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed worldwide through the position of each individual traceable ship."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together with the neighbours, to get a better image of it, who knows what is doing, "" he says. "" here's a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">We should do this at a global level. "" Pew Charitable Trusts has a similar project to run with which a global system allows for the persecution of ships.</seg>
<seg id="142">There are indications that FISH-i's activities are not only criminals but they are also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which previously confiscated without license and had hardly to calculate with consequences, know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i took a 33% increase in fishing sales ever since fishing boats anymore."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had assisted Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board lock nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that us now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we're an academic project." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars disappear every year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries were closed together, so called West Africa Task Force, too. they now fight illegal fishing, following the same model as FISH-i." "with security is the goal to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member of Somalia could report his first big triumph in October: in October there was Greko 1, a ship that was under a false flag. and not only the ship was used without a license and have been forbidden to use towing networks."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was still prohibited in banned waters that are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the action of measures against Greko 1 put them a strong sign that they proceed against illegal fishing." "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the evidence that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="231">"on the first and last time, he left me at the entrance in the car."</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time he commanded me to go out. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, television, fridges - just everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>

<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut down, and maintained me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he interpreted to an open space and said:</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide dissemination of translators are varied.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to transfer, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the original text and active language skills to transfer it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires active domination of the target language - something that is in language skills. generally, the conviction that translator should be in the target language - not in the initial language - native speaker."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native language should translate into French in French - not from the French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies employ no staff with English as a native language, which could make translations into English. this may lack understanding for the transfer, cost reasons, or the relatively small number of English native speakers, which learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"nevertheless, some companies that have no foreign employees cannot be firmerally. then the Japanese staff, whose English knowledge is considered the best to be translators, no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr-users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation are also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the worrative and enigmatic sentences created by machine translation, show that this technology can not replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English forums in Japan, including the enigmatic printouts that are often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for ilistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be as jewelry still acceptable or at least harmless. but of large companies or from the government that have the means of ensuring higher standards, you can expect more careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, then it means that they are a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who seek approval or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a judicial process."</seg>
<seg id="517">"this is technically not realistically realistic, but in Egypt everything is possible."</seg>

<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the tribe of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, even" Highway of tears, "in which almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>

<seg id="702">"in the following song, the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation, the chorus is sung in Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the youngsters provided some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip hop group, who gave them a verse in dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"at the Facebookpage of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in the heading, as well as translation into English, which is translated into German:"</seg>

<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses, such as El Chapo Guzmán, chief of the Sinaloa carton, pressed the stories of the victims of conflict completely in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, anyone looks at the mourning or to the communities who have learned to live with pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind every bone structure in the hundreds of heated graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never heal."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal, animal Político is the digital project" Aprera Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" "learning to live a voice) and tells stories about people who were in the fight between prosecutions and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>

<seg id="756">The effects are much deeper.</seg>

<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprera Vivir con el narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we don't just need to show the faces of those who are afraid of fear. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility, and the statute."</seg>

<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) if it's big. and it's not normal that people talk about the" heroism "of the offenders if they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is, as if they have lost those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they are so something like that."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories to naked numbers are in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the inaction of human beings is incredible for me, if the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village is justified to be justified."</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they are trying to talk about such tragedies, if they don't touch and still remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the contribution" Four months of compressing at the main city district: how a family has been plundered for month's money from their business, until they were not only destroyed by the end, but also their family apart. "</seg>

<seg id="799">"the journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article" "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: one of the most distinguished generation."</seg>

<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents take care of them."</seg>

<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he said to him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>

<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the civil security and government of the United States government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 murders. this corresponds to average 8,5 murders per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">"these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories, which leaves the organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the country's soul."</seg>
<seg id="814">Few stories still live in view of new headlines. but this project reminds us of those who are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprera Vivir Con El Narco, "animal Político is established in 2015, whose aim is to present the complex information behind the drug trafficking, which has failed to represent the country in the past four decades in comprehensible ways."</seg>

<seg id="1142">"the mass mortality of the world can be avoided when we create cities, accept diversity - safe spaces, in which residents don't have to forget who they are."</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening is often associated to understand" "these events instead" "listen to appreciate, to make, to link."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers introduce their story first in their own language and translate or explain it in English."</seg>

<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored by the word" Kalar, "or," "Kalar," "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the ascent of radical nationalist movements have given an extremely decreasing connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by Ultra nationalists than hate crimes against Muslims which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to tackle hate speech in Myanmar, the company has licensed a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today 'Kalar' may normally be associated with racism, but the word of itself does not appear automatically."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even Posts, in which they have discussed the use of the Word or expressed a doubt of his use, censored."</seg>

<seg id="1470">An revised version was re-released as part of a Content-Sharing Agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, there are women with the greatest care to pronounce the name of their husbands, or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronouns or say" father of my child. ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh to respect women that they should respect the social pressure to the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should preserve the norm in life."</seg>

<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also not call upon name, is also common among men. however, they did not fear less assignments if any, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the district of Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, among them health staff, and housewives, a unique club and were therefore quickly became the main discussion of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"it is a place only for them alone, in which they discuss and discuss the hostility of the patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, who exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the community video Volunteers and advocate for the dismantling of the patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas working for seven years with the help of their videocamera to the coverage of practices, such as child marriage to the ban of HIV- and AIDS infected, and directs this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and made it at the same time as ambassador to the mural.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini showed in their discussion, did women who call their husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She decided on this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about Patriarchate with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands, an agent, whom they have all condemned, and never asked any question."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wish him long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who doesn't stop this will be considered back as a woman, without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted up that we never did so far back to this discussion round.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini wanted her husband to have never known her husband's husband, at home how it works."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother in law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband silent long after the video was at an end.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said, I should call him from now on by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started her first discussion with this self-confidence in Bagini.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "never before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women were protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, women tried to bring the discussion with a exercise in motion."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different emotions - happy, annoyed, lovingly, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then asked them all," If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, meaning that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day to whom they brought the name of their husbands over her lips," says Rohini Pawas from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra over the breaking of a yearling tradition in which married women may never speak the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells you:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during all the practice, she just drove before, and another decided to leave the whole day frustration against him and his family, spreading it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"even in Adrenalinrush on how to have broken with an ancient bridge, the women decided that they actually would try to call their husbands at the name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next days, Rohini received a wide variety of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put on women in his head, saying: his wife could not stop saying his name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another wise member decided to do it with supper before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she stared her, she was afraid and said that it was an error."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini said that I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understandable and the situation artete in violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reported how women have attempted to stop other practices, such as the wearing of interest in the red point on the forehead, which shows the marriage status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do only women have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would bear the interest nored point if it was possible."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"he laughed only, and I heard that he might carry him."</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women were not completely stopped, but I mean, they are now in a better position to choose to carry it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion hits a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and objectives."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"we make a trip with every discussion tour.</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we take lunch and water and go out into the box.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want to make the women take care of what could hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their lives and talked about things which they had never done before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years, and yet I have worked on some things such as our identities to our husbands, never talked to honestly."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great, certain things can be noisy, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only bore saris in their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"most of them is okay, but some wanted to carry a salinity-Kurta, a vast shirt of a pants, they don't have."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of dispute and discussion on the advantages of your own coat-dial, the morality associated with the Saris and much more, smugely Rohini her own pair Kurtas (upper hemden) in a discussion round, so that women could carry them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa where they can carry Jeans and Rohini is sure that they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"at the question of whether in the five months since her first discussion, Rohini confirmed that things come slowly into the roll:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">"so far, we have made only little steps."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tested it a few times, but then they stopped to say the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do not make it, but only if they are alone and there are no other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">One or two will continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in discussion hits that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the shooting of more mobility or its own coat-dial - at the end of a difficult to navigate.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"in making each other self-confidence, they will be aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">As Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a sacrifice of patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"however, this club gives us the confidence that something will change."</seg>
<seg id="1542">"and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction, if every woman enters the club and other people will say what we are talking about and what we are doing."</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">"the correspondents of the video Volunteers community come from outdated groups in India, making videos about stories, which is not reported."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam should be regarded as a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting at a meeting of the international branch of the Association of State of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because they compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He support Singapore should be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">Nobody asked whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">"this is, with most people taking a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1691">I tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to twist the logic in order to defend the existing authorities in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, according to all our efforts and offered to create this valuable country, we hear that we do not end a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the sight of a flight before the responsibilities, a must violate."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons behind Shanmugam were not very nobel: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of his, he appeared irreconceivable undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"in contrast, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco, or New York alike."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the core point of the subject, the good old lyre can be reached by the authoritarian machinations, who forsake the Democrats, leaving the twisted logic, since it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week the final week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our Judikative, our political system truly non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He would ask the relevant questions with non-responses.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng calls for Shanmugam on his opinion, because she didn't understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city is, so to which country is our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our advertised K Shanmugam would take up the effort to clarify this point, if it was paid high in order to be part of the government of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"commenting on the blog, he comments on the critics that one should start to read the entire transcript of the conference, so that you can understand the context of Shanmugam better according to which Singapore was a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Please read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore is more a" "city" "as a country," "he declared why the elections are so important in Singapore, even if we are looking forward to free and righteous elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He contracted Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said," Singapore "is not a country," he obviously doesn't mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">Clement Tan shows his disappointment of Shanmugam who is the leader of a growing generation that makes such polemic statement.</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am aware of what the Minister of Justice of Singapore has said to...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Garde, which I expected to agree with them or not, but this is another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure whether he really believes that he is defended correctly."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review lays the vulnerability of Shanmugams arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">Does Mr. Shanmugam granted a mistake on "benign a mistake" or was it a Freudge speaker?</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are considered as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, in which country goes back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique. it is equally countryside and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government wireless, the testimony of Mr. Shanmugam is of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who needs to pay our prime minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the journal Journey of a Decade invites you to annihilate, Singapore is always a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have offended many people of Singapur...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We were always a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but that's not quite right."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1747">"this is one of the reasons why so many Canadians make a Canadian flag well visible on their rucksack, if they are travelling."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants, cross Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula he is located on the border to Guatemala.</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is managed by a 59- year-old Mexicanerin, a small woman with a coral-pink brist frame and golden brown earrings in teddy bear shape."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and grew up in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it) become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel rather has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 dollar the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, brittle walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no signpost to the hotel - but hundreds of African and haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms. Ramírez tells us the people in full small busses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mum Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the time it's rather quiet, but this year Ramírez received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She would not refuse to refuse.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and bring them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they can't pay, they massage them with a balm that frightened away from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived in a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mom is a reasonable nickname for Mrs Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui who has a jogging) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he responds to a smile. "I really feel that it suits her, as African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastiao travels with his sister, hoping to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on the way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then go towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard of other merchanters of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the circuit, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"he tells the Haitians and the Africans often travel together the route and that, the Africans speak on Whatsapp by Mrs. Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1927">"as many of his leaders, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a building worker at the construction site of the Olympic Games and the football World Championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he started his journey into the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"he has been a guest in Mum Africa since months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money, to buy the Busters to Tijuana."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will contact Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let them go again," he responding. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Ms. Ramírez tells that their guests are often sending messages when they are gone to grin, or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">It explains that their Christian faith is the impulse of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"they don't know much about Africa, but their guests have taught chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well-known, but she is not the only sparking hope for migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"at the other end of the city, a sawgasse to Jesús Valenzuela leads."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family lived in their little house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is policeman and has found that the Bustets are sold to many African migrants to be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he began to help them to get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment 25 people are here, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valencian explains that he knows what the guests do.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he tells. "I have experienced what they experience."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border with the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. this is the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after he lived for three years, he was sent out of the United States after a raid on his workplace."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula comes from Central America, other residents open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he has fled to Honduras with his wife and his three children who wanted to press money without a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he was asked for an accommodation and an unknown, an omnivorous, has offered it its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa is all again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the courses, travellers should consult their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">A small bus has arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to a large part of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy about her that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"like a proud grandmother, she prepares her album with numerous photos."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African folkles, who made her a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and elderly."</seg>

<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib brings most of his time inside; once again he cove to his screen, to his computer, and again to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But whereof you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or to discover nicotine beating lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel had forced its occupation of the West Bank and forced Hdaibs family to flee from her village in Palestine in which she had lived as felimyeen (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years, Hdaib is a passionate activist, who was transferred to the conservative majority (for six years) and asking their original opinions about gender roles, sexuality and free opinion of expression through art and rapist."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music that often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of the whole Arab world. all these topics not only find in its hometown of Amman, but also in cities that spread from Damascus in Syria to a whole of Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees itself as someone who is not affected in his thinking, and he can feel the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries like Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if it fails to access it, he sweeps on the US foreign policy a special dislike."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib sees his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, anything with his identity as" Palestinian resistance of the second generation "- so he describes himself even when he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own life circumstances," Hdaib stresses. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a human being" while in water soldered nest-café in two cups, it is the holy month Ramadan; at that time it is intended for Muslims to fasten from sunrise to sunset. "</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that public consumption of food is illegal during the Ramadan.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib revealed a certain weakness for keeping with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee at a sening hot Junitag has little with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the shuffle speak warm coffee and the squadron of the Kent cigarette into the nose in the first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one throws a look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it avoids easy to do basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan water - to avoid not in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">Recently the Interior Minister Jordanians had cancelled a appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila to the second time.</seg>
<seg id="2111">"the Muslim Brotherhood of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the country is contradicted by the Muslim Brotherhood Hamed Sinno, the cultural and traditional norms of the country."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert had been cancelled due to sexual orientation of the singers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"in addition, many claim that the involvement of the band in matters like the Arab Spring, human rights and free expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism that places the established legitimacy of authoritarian regimes in the entire region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila invents the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "which continued to apply for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement is probably not simply silky rhetoric, but actually reflects a clear crystallizing reality in Jordan, which occurs in Hdaibs's work clearly."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, the Hdaib traditional gender-norms turned out to body by having made his vision of the fate of Arab women who have been vorehelichen."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an obvious unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually should trust.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"over the past few years, in Jordan, the number of 'honorary citizens' has increased - the unofficial outward outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honmorgades reached its peak in 2016; however, it still exists, that Jordan is missing the institutional infrastructure to support women, victims attempted murder or domestic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on fragile control from 1954 women, women who are under threat to family-family violence," and for their release is often necessary to have a few years of bureaucratic expenditures as well as the guarantee on the family that the woman will not happen. "</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaibs Music enjoys great popularity and is well known for it to reverb the topics that are long as tabu in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is politically, however, knowing that he is his music that is full of explicit attitudes on sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in my opinion, politics was enfeeble," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes the question about the Palestinian identity in attack.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs, which are politically politically, can continue."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is often repeated:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and each other is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market, on which one can, in his words," that can be what you want "- be it faith or anti-faith, Hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notices that hardly anyone speaks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on gender equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored until in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib led an interview for the popular Jordanian Onlineprogram Roya, to remember that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and been censored in his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube, it was uploaded without cuts, but he was only a working version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib buys open to the Arab LGBTQ + Community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals do not speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nudas, a poet of the eighth century, still today remained in remembrance thanks to its homoerotic poetry."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nudas, who later was to work on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century. why cannot Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, did nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemic kingdom, it is nothing new anymore that the government's attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive votes become silent."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian Intelligence Service took up several former government officials and members of the teaching position, with the reason they expressed in commentary in social media to solve the problems with which deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the show Hdaibs said that only the top of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is an independent slide and take. Jordan has denied a gig in a row, but the way of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and internalized changes. he is sure that these changes from day to day at the heart of the Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib dreams, like millions of other Arabs also, of a Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to experience" them. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will be carried out by music, art and literature of real and basic openness - and not by bombs, traumpositions, and artificial nature. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until it is done, Hdaib continues to rap and resist the resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was conducted by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Management, which was heard as a student Fellow. "</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories about the origin of the Nebuta festivals.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one might suspect that there is a variation of the Tanabata festivals, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the Festing and dancing over a thousand years have crossed over a thousand years to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region."</seg>

<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" "Liebesmessages of guerrilla fighters," which has released the international online magazine Tea after Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">This entry will be published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people who we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who have cast out to suit the affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">Exactly this question went out of the two young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the Young-Youth Foundation not out of the head and inspired them to the campaign cartas por la Reconciliación (letters to reconciliation) to write young people to write guerrilla fighters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to their part: after years of negotiations the Colombian government concluded a peace agreement with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces Colombia), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the sign of peace agreement was considered as significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received for his merits the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"in front of Colombia, there is still a long way until one can speak of a real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters that have lived for many years in illegal camps, have been exposed to war rhetoric and around the clock, their weapons were forced to insure themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"in turn, the Colombian society itself, who had accustomed itself to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred against guerrilla fighters, now has to support them in their ranks and support them in setting up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombian must join together and help integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and exactly what they did: until now, thousands of young people have written letters - love messages of former guerrilla fighters to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the goal of the campaign are 6900 letters - one for each former guerrilla fighters, which should be handed to personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as a inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Peace Laureate, which was held in Bogotá in February 2017. there Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk shortly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this declared that we love those who love those who love thousands of love letters, but those who need much more necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plan, he told, in this year he talked to share his love with people who needed the most urgent need."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan arose to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, which is now ready to build up a new life." the letters will show that the Colombian society is willing to make the discourse of a war history to a common history of peace, "they say."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"so far, more than 2000 letters were collected in the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought that someone would forgive me '</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotway Foundation to create the letters in person."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were so on how they had done it earlier in order to oppose the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no commands, but letters of subsmen from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's unbelievable how many different emotions you can walk through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything that is between "," told the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Province of Valle del Cauca Province, described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after having passed the letters, a former fighters led me through the camp of guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, where the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighters who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed there was a MGL-pomegranate, a fatal weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I said to him," Hello, what are they doing? "he answered," I answer a letter which someone wrote to me. ""</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before me in my life, someone wrote something so beautiful, that's why I answer it." "I suddenly heard the tears on the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him, and sat down beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of faithful companions of this fighter, and would help him to write this epistle."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else than war. he never had anything else from life than war." "the FARC was the only opportunity to keep him and his six brothers before the Hungertod." I have never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">"but now I know, that there is a society out there, waiting for us with open arms."</seg>
<seg id="2218">Until now I have learned how to deal with weapons.</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the start-start, students and some leader of the FARC came together on a discussion round together."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up and already war, and the FARC already outlived in secret places."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC states the history of the organization, its ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have experienced how the social injustice organized by the state on the whole Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to create a political party, we can contribute to the society in this country fair. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"those people who had never found hearing, and had no electoral law, and to know that the people I often have seen as a monster, and even those who have turned around as monsters, who were turned around through their lives and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality, in which the country lives, hurt me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all men - even those who have been killed and so much damage have caused us to contribute to us, and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have answered the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commander of the camp at Caldono-Cauca, wrote the Archbishop of the town of Cali, the Archbishop of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombia was prophesying that there would rule peace after dehydration.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to rise up and to protest the weapons, and that is completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace, no matter which race, religion or ideology have to listen to all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring offerings, because we know nothing is simple. to those who defend life as the basis of existence, many difficulties are imminent."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way, there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experience with us, and talked with us what is happening in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines before several months, after reports published, which have been published, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in the Nowaja Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechen authorities seeking suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they brought a monster to the world,"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny, and grew up there."</seg>

<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, why she went to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group had learned from the gender equality of their land, the hunt for Sabrina has been opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">They came out of fear for her life in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helmets on a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">"one day, I told me that someone needed my help."</seg>
<seg id="2257">"this was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone, from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he spiciled them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" then there is no more men in Chechnya who can solve these disgrace?

<seg id="2309">"our people know, in which hotel you steckest. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Just to prove it: it's the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine this?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the gender equality. however, this is a table theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish it, these seelic barrier can't be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"if we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person that they are reminded of their past - so remember my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends do, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I filed a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For this I needed latest information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to somebody who had dinner one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait to wait, and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"that I mean, they probably charge the relatives, these are responsible for the problem with the affected person and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced by blood."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are you also gay men now set up in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of me says it was not very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, especially those who have no rich relatives or dropped from their relatives to present the Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they will be held there, so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: should they be killed, they will show their bodies in television and claim that they have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply disappeared, but specifically dipped to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a guess or have you a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I'm reading someone who was imprisoned for a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard was grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new from them since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They simply took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and so called Lord, this person was present themselves when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports so far. we assume that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could it not allow this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutations and kidnappings of people, who have heard a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, have already took place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always been wearing my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003 I was already very well known, when I was living there - and I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">Seriously! in Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999 when Sharia was considered, I never had problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much more secure than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia was originally intended to bring us back to the civil war, but ultimately led us back to the stone time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is it possible with the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were brewed; I had painted lashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Security of Scharia has never dared a hair with me.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian Theatre in Grozny, there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a speech: Kharda ma Kharda. that means: "spire not about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"it is often said to children, if people have fun with wreath."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they simply have their eyes closed before you, because they believed, you are sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulting me, never hunted, and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did these gifts hold on?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: as long as Kadyrow occurred to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed prime minister in 2005, he began talking about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but primarily about the behavior of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who had laughed and laughed, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">During the time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the republic is steadily growing."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity will you go now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I'm working as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I'm still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"at present, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I comment with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we perfectly organize teetreffs, conventions, I teach them to hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't leave any cents.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people themselves when I apperched a curse.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslim and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddenab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's altimely.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature, that has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same like chuckles, who want to know you with foam in front of the mouth, that there is no gay ones with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have those who have the cabardiners who have the Russians also have; on the whole planet it is - but not in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, that's why it is unpleasant to listen to something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men out of Caucasia.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims in the mosque and during the Ramadan fasten - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think of Transidentity to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a trusteer."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of emotion, to be exact, different living conditions."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not harm me for my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I'm going to personally personally, but my final intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I myself am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion which was published by Ayomide Zuri and originally published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the object of several discussions where many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"if I say that I'm not a feminist, a lot of women - especially white women who call themselves as intermedial feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">You wonder why I'm not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even rehearsed scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we generally should be a feminist * inside.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women may still earn less money in the same education as men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"that women are still under strict observation, if it is about what they are to do with their body."</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social standards still ensure that women sooner or later in various areas of life to a glacne blanket, and that discrimination based on gender is still across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced of that and I suffer double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, when I come to skin color on black women, on black women in the LGBTIQ-community or black women from the Diaspora; if I consider how we are physically abused in the LGBT community or in black women, many white feminists decide to hold many white feminists and white intersectional feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, they all agree that women - all women should come together to take up their voices, and 'Kumbaya, my Lord' to sing" to sing equality (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it in addition to sexualised violence a institutional form of assimildly motivated violence, which we are subject to black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or above that black women and women may benefit from other ethnicities and highways less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to school, as a white girl, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spouses and women with a migration background are exposed to higher risk, domestic violence and violence in the partnership than white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and ever any skin color have the same rights; on the other hand, I can't connect to a movement whose center is the white woman who refuses to refer to injustice in their mind as well as to the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and won't be struggling to fight my affiliation in a white-feminist spouses who always and countless other black women always have rejected.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"sojourner committed suicide in 1851 in their speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain a ideology, in which the black woman is a human and marginal beings."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join me group, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to promote their egocentralized program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will not try to learn white women the importance of the overlapping of skin color and gender. because some of them will continue to remain the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women are attempting to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intermedial feminism was founded to give women of different approaches a home and renounce itself from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is in his name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to get rid of myself full and full of feminism, which was called for my dark skin and my status as a woman, instead of using me for a white-feminist paradigm, which is so stubbornly celebrated that intersectionality is celebrated as a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now, it is more important than ever before we define black women to our own ideas and engage us into the spheres which we created for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">Clenora Hudson-Weems who define the author of the book Africana womanism: recall that we can defend ourselves in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately call separatism and exclusion, after reading these lines, I ask you about the hypocrisy and contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black women is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a blurred environment, I can claim black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"due to my dark skin and because of my existence, I recognized as a part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life doesn't survive, nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>

<seg id="2469">"ever again, Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq last 7 years - mostly with surf board or in canoe - with a special concern through the Kurdistan region of Iraq. his mission aims to develop the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentation by Emily Kinskey, we follow Musa, who declared to us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution in its church."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was a child," said Musa. "</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fears that the decades of war, the construction of reservoir, pollution and uncontrolled development, lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organisation Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterproof Alliance - which is committed to protect the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq as well as the local communities in the sustainable use of this natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the pressures and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water anymore, how would we survive? "</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and worked version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by turally. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# soft egginity) that reports about the violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names were changed to protect persons affected.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"Ada Báez said that she could not do anything against Luis Balbuena, her ex partner, who could have been active as forcible."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship a little time has passed and the police, her statement would not be laid, but more could you do."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another wife Balbuena showed nothing due to abuse, the acclaimed advert of Ada Báez nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second wife moved away their advert."</seg>
<seg id="2486">The vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women are allowed to display at any time, they do not receive assistance from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, the women are also financially dependent on men who abuse them. this explains why only 20% of all women who admit to admit victims of violence in general, in law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"Invol1 strokes and Statistic 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that has nothing subtert3 of the laws: good approach, lacking implementation hit and stats"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is difficult to determine how many women can really be mistreamed, says Myrian González, a social scientific research institute in Paraguay." there are different information and reports, which show not even a satin-the magnitude of gender violence against women in Paraguay, "explains them."</seg>
<seg id="2491">These figures have to be alarming however.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District Office of Attorney General, there were 9600 ads for domestic violence. 70% of them went to violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads come from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads for domestic violence at the peace dishes. 86% of the ads attended by women.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisement, 40% of women said they were physically harassed, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics show not the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguayan women's Minister Ana Baiardi are only given a few of those offences in fact." on each woman, who will not be refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, there are 9 women who do not. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"at the end of 2014, two women who do not do this will be refunded on every woman who does not do this," declared at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay has no own offences, prosecutions authorities cannot be documented, as many women are murdered every year from their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">"the Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to estimates, in Paraguay every ten days a woman died due to violence by men."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez was the fixed friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"at the beginning she didn't want to do that, however, however, however. this should always repent."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and no longer with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychic violence against women, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2508">I have never thought that I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier this, I always thought that the only women had happened that they are subject to violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana uses social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name, she wrote contributions on Facebook where she described his insults and different attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he isolated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos itself. he asked rhetoric, whether he had ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behavior was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why they had fallen that so long from Carlos and did not leave him earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost like that, when they wanted to say that victims of abuse have at least some complicity in it."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, to prove that their former partner she mistreated her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") that consists of women all in any way victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can speak with others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take statements on women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"finally, her wealthy partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it initiated a process against their former partner who developed into an unsearchable legal conflict between Paraguay and its home country, where it mainly went for money, power and the influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay Law: good approach, deficient implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws which are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the abuses of abuses is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," says Victoria Santos. "</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, sees great problems in the application of the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a draft law was discussed under the hashtag # Porej (# Fürsten)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and movement # NisymMenos (# non-Less) are part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports about solvents worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton had been dancing in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties such as outreddish, the first plant which has been cultivated and consumed by NASA-Astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"almost 20 years of work, Morton's work was made only by its own income and the question how many salads... he can get limits."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000s, he noticed that more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use the breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special rotor or green leaf."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more of such patents have been registered for more plants such as cereals or cardboard. due to this trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia of old tradition, Morton still uses salad, however it takes longer when his work is increasingly difficult for ever since its work."</seg>
<seg id="2636">"it is, as if a rock lie in a river, in order to make the blunt."</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do this now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents are going to go far too far."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stick to judgment, no one can breed a new salads, because all characteristics are already patented. so it's so good as possible and tries to extract those features that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material, which is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement, which is growing in the USA and throughout the world: open source Breeding (" Open Source "-breedings)."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have produced red skirts of the variety outreddish in the "greenhouse" plant "of the station. there is tested whether plants can be cultivated in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds like that, as if the movement from the IT area would come and not from the area of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for "Open Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software to provide alternatives to copyright-protected software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was called into life to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property, and so for plant breeders are usable."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, U.S. breeder can also undertake that others may be able to use farmed fruit well."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"this does not mean, however, that they do not continue to do with their seed and sell it." open source "breeders allow only others to breeding their seed, and it is not immediately inflamed - two aspects which are forbidden by many plant patrons."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Dark outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"Professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg are control of the seeds and the possibility to breed new plants, both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to him, it plays a role in larger associations such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the nutrition system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to try the latter not or only little to use the seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg stresses that the" open-source "movement does not work with genetically modified plants."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, we need control of organic farming or not." to buy our goal of ecological sustainability, such as it may be offered on farms in the global agricultural industry, so it should also know that the way is bred on farms as such as this vegetables is bred. "</seg>
<seg id="2654">Dietary effortlessly without seed-confident people is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative are obliged to provide other seed still freely available, as opposed to these, seed and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporter argue that the future of food supplies are threatened, since the available Genpool due to the increasingly abundant intellectual property rights in plant material, which is therefore always limited to be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, a Director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation on carrots and their availability. she found out that about one-third of all cardboard features is protected as intellectual property, which is either useless for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants, such estimates do not exist, but experts like Luby suspect that massensely inned plants like wheat in even greater style patented are as lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants will be so bred that they are targeted characteristic features - of such, as their taste or their color improves, because of which they thrive in certain environments such as pests and diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents based on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is steadily decreasing. genetic diversity is currently more constrained than ever since the changed conditions are predictable much worse by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Spreader Carly Scaduto know that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Agricultural Ministry of the United States, the company set itself for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, in fact, it contradicts that intellectual property including other breeders, as" patents and the protection of plant varieties innovations promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan which everyone can follow once the patent has expired. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">"often, these instructions help others to get the same result with another method."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"this means that such protection does not inhibits innovations, but promotes them by making more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees it differently: 20 years waiting until a patent expelling, certainly does not have any innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for so long to breed plants, which are adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one could have lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources still have been a general public, and there should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither the time nor the money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive for us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want to make farmers easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what we drive us, and it is impossible to use us if we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton interferes with the concept to examine plant features:" we do not really create the characteristics. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"plants form themselves, and as breeders, we have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A mystery of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeding in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of the plant breeding:" who is breeding a variety, also breeding his own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for which cultivates are necessary herbicides, breeding in its varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just gentleman. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets but smaller than e.g. Monsanto are) patents, there are most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either do they reject the patented, or they are not worthwhile or both in the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">Frank Morton is searching for an independent plant garden Salate.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photograph of Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeders through avoidance of plant patronics would say:" it looks like I am using my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a lot of new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are going to sell my varieties in a few years even," he says. "with a patent one is 20 years ahead of competition, with which you simply make it very nice." worldwide resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the USA seem to be a leader in the" Open Source "breeding, the concept has now spread rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable agriculture "), which describes itself as professional organization in the field of resources, is an" open-source "seed program." for obtaining the seed of traditional plant vegetarians, the centre is working together with farmers and helps them meet new varieties. "</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell her own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an" open source "license which, ultimately, is a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(rules for breeders differ from land to land, absent for Ossi commitment not just one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, states that the conventionally-bred plants should not be patented. thus, she talks about the current practice of the European Patent Office, the patents on conventionally cultivated plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, a statement is not yet a law; now it is the governments of the Member States to bring the patent offices to this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference entitled" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, to farmers, operators and representatives from all East Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and global trend to investigate seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's programme for" Open Source "seed, states that the organization is currently a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed-benches, for which the next year the official start should be dropped."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a combination of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit aid organisation USC Canada and the action group to erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database of seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of eating - a consortium of aid organisations like the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - have published a report. in this, she represents the opportunity to exchange and improve and improve the seed policy to ensure a stable supply with food-food."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"in the report, the importance of a varied, local supply with seed for sustainable food systems emphasises - a connection between the Luby von Ossi hopes to recognize it soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has been respected above all, where and how little is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role, so Luby." we are trying to make people clearer that there is still more behind their food. "</seg>

<seg id="2724">"in August, the network published a statement on Facebook where it criticised the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"the Universal Network for Human Rights Information Wait - despite this attack and the constitution of Egyptian law and the Constitution to defend this goal, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI, even though it was never so difficult to overcome them, so it was never so important as now. ANHRI was able to overcome all technical possibilities to overcome the blocking, and not afterwards. we hope to keep our task further."</seg>
<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first licensed site of a human rights organisation in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabian language of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network for" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"besides ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and Human Rights research, Ahmed Gamal Ziada is no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada took his blog for the spread of columnies and articles he writes in Egypt's non-access websites and media.</seg>

<seg id="2731">"blogger, which is home to the Ziadas blog, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 and recorded a video how the police reported physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His article turn mainly around politics and human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook commentary, Ziada commented on the blocking due to the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"the blogs to lock is very old, but has a priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningless for the world, so it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) It happened to them to give me the feeling of a siege to mediate, an attempted murder, an attempted murder, reloading of the national Security Council, the blocking blogs, as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You demonstrated that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, if only in a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I took it to the post of articles to bypass the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"however, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The Much walks through the way up to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (AFTE) the Egyptian authorities closed from May 24 to August 06. 133 websites. this showed technical tests on the networks of various internet service providers (ISP), including orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"also, AFTE also documented the blocking of providers due to the transition of internet censorship and private surfing, called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">AFTE reported in research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12th we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">"such a practice suggests, focusing on the intention of the government, continue to block content and filters to access the Egyptian users could have access."</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is intensified, that the interest decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis in which they can proceed in court against these actions."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with censorship and who will attack them next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2770">Does the name "war" more than they use it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argued that violence as" war "refers to a justification of the failed security policy through the media and could make it harder to rule the responsibility of the police."</seg>
