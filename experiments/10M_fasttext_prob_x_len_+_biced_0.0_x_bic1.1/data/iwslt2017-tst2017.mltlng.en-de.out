this is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times reporter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA reportedly heard illegal teleph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression .
in this he describes a dis@@ astro@@ us US intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally dra@@ fted for a nuclear bomb .
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know whom the chapter isn &apos;t pleased ?
the US government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government counts with R@@ isen and called him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol for the design of the government , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer to condemn and journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional Law , the media have the right to publish more secret information . &quot;
&quot; however , it is impossible to apply this right when media is not able to protect this information , and if they cannot protect their identity , they will be given . &quot;
&quot; so when the government for@@ ged R@@ isen , he did something that had already done a lot of cour@@ ageous journalists before him : he refused , and said that he would prefer to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen was thus living with risk to go into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something unusual happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though it had been essential for years that it would be essential for their case , the government &apos;s demands were dropped by R@@ isen . &quot;
&quot; the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring , rep@@ orters and sources can always hide less . &quot;
&quot; instead of fail@@ ing and ra@@ v@@ ans to correct statements , you could also do his digital Foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his permission , concerned his phone calls for home , &quot;
&quot; just like his E @-@ Mail data , financial and ban@@ etic information , its credit card , and even travel information with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of these information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA w@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer and risk to condemn . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
President Obama promised to protect W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him .
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government has become too much of their work as home . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result that a whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so , we set the press work on the playing , which should be protected by the first constitutional law , because the government has more possibilities to express all . &quot;
&quot; just like technology of the government allowed to circum@@ vent the rights of rep@@ orters , the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better . &quot;
&quot; indeed , they may take that from the moment in which they contact contact , rather than in the desc@@ endant , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which had not yet been written as R@@ isen , and it is essentially more secure than normal e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source transition system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer , which was originally developed by the Internet renowned , which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , which I have been working out today . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site , just as the Washington Post here . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send documents , like in any ordinary contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , at which the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government cannot provide more information in secret services , and many of the information that would like to request would not be available from the out@@ set . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments develop new sp@@ ying technologies all over the world that all end@@ anger ourselves . &quot;
&quot; it is to ensure that there are not only technology experts , like Edward Snow@@ den , have a possibility to put ini@@ quities . it is just as important that we protect the next W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know about abuse by soldiers with the supply of soldiers . or the next environmental worker , the alarm will strike the contam@@ inated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis . &quot;
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only done for those who want to un@@ cover the crimes , but to protect our fundamental rights . &quot;
thanks .
&quot; &#91; on April 3 , 2016 , the largest data le@@ ck of history was released . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal , &quot; &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; &quot; &#91; ... &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; this week , we asked Robert Pal@@ mer by Global Wit@@ ness to have an explanation . &#93; this week we were asked by news about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents in Panama &apos;s local law firm Mos@@ se@@ ca . &quot;
the publication of these documents are a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we will get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms such as Mos@@ ch@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; actually , we actually see e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this already led to the first very direct consequences .
Iceland Prime Minister has stepped down .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator B@@ ar al @-@ Assad station@@ ed companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens has . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a track of $ 2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nervous to the next release , and to the next revealed documents . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it sh@@ ines away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should it be ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare , education , streets . &quot;
and this concerns us all .
&quot; for my organisation , Global Wit@@ ness , these revel@@ ations are phenomen@@ al . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss media and leading politicians , such as secret tax ha@@ v@@ ases are used to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and un@@ veil for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will seem very conf@@ using this whole world , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax haven &apos;t work . &quot;
I always imagine a Mat@@ r@@ j@@ os@@ ch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so , one company has a company in another company , in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these blo@@ il@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosec@@ utions and tax authorities , as well as journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably because there was no prominent American Americans who have occurred in these revel@@ ations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now it is not that there are not enough Americans , who hide their wealth in ha@@ v@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle that this tax haven &apos;t work , Mos@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ck of the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that you need less information in some US states to use less information to establish a company than to get a li@@ br@@ isk reference . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees from school children to block school children .
&quot; it has permitted che@@ aters , especially vulnerable investors . &quot;
it is this kind of behavior that affects us all .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a covered investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 Law@@ yers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ators gave himself as an African ministers , who wanted to bring the susp@@ ect money into the US to buy a yacht to buy a private jet . &quot;
we really sho@@ cked us that everyone would make suggestions about a lawyer in our investig@@ ator as he could transfer his money .
&quot; these were all pre @-@ preaching . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no eman@@ cip@@ ation was given to the money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important to consider that not as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has under@@ lining our secret investigation .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single top position , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; to cope with this , we need to change the rules . &quot;
we need to change rules in order to make this kind of behavior .
&quot; this sound really sound , as if we could not do anything about it ; as if nothing has ever changed , as if it is always the wealthy and powerful . &quot;
but as a borro@@ wed optim@@ ist I really see that something has begun to change .
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen more transparency to more transparency , regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the theme was political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has been recorded in central regi@@ sters at national level , who really is behind companies in Europe , and who controls them . &quot;
one of the un@@ pleasant facts is that the US would go back here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have inserted a bill of legislative law , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama revel@@ ations , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ases , is used as a means to ensure visibility in the USA and globally for more transparency . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for changes .
&quot; we need ordinary people , which will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lights . &quot;
we need managers in the economy which stand up and say : &quot; In@@ transparent is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; we need leading politicians who realize the problem , and use it to termin@@ ate this kind of in@@ transparency . &quot;
&quot; together we can finish the In@@ transparent , which enables us to finish this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
this is the story how I have been kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das .
&quot; one day after I had completed my design studies , I made a home farm . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stayed and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my art works .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . thereafter he would go to the peace of peace .
I invited him to a beer . he told me about how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse , &quot; I don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; and I thought : &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just met him ! he says he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really is planning . I don &apos;t want to land in the boot of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an aerial view . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; eh , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night , I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed to the blanket and thought : &quot; Oh man ! what did I go before me ? &quot;
a wild living in my living room .
what if it is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of the bed , at Z@@ eh@@ en@@ pointed at the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not mad .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the work of art , which he bought by me , hung today in his class@@ room . he is now teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has changed my view angle completely .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood , were actually friends who were waiting only to be discovered ? &quot;
&quot; people on my air mat@@ o@@ ze to lodge , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the aerial view . &quot;
&quot; let us make a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost ple@@ ading , my ro@@ omm@@ ates and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were booked .
&quot; I think creativity is able to create fear in fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new ro@@ omm@@ ates Brian Ches@@ ky : &quot; &quot; Brian , I have over how we could earn something to earn . our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk inclusive , a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so called &quot; air@@ mat@@ ch@@ ze and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on a wood floor for 20 dollars .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I &apos;m sure that our cheese ham O@@ mel@@ on was completely different , because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest , and the door to the castle fell , stiff Brian and I started . &quot;
we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rental ?
things came in rolls .
&quot; my former ro@@ omm@@ ate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to figure out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; so we presented the investors : &quot; we want to create a website , on which people publicly shared images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing when you visit . &quot;
&quot; on the Internet , they can then invite the foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would burn .
but they did not do it .
&quot; no one who is still in sol@@ ace , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
&quot; because we , as children , have learned that foreigners are dangerous . &quot;
&quot; if one has a problem , you are inside the things you can do . we could design@@ ate . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and h@@ ap@@ tic -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust through its design , between people who never met before . &quot;
can design be made so anything ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a taste , what degrees trust we stri@@ cken . &quot;
it &apos;s a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
keep your thum@@ bs up if you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
&quot; now , I would like to un@@ locking your mobile phone . &quot;
enter your un@@ locked cell phone your left seat .
&quot; this silent flight of panic , which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts the host when they open the door . &quot;
&quot; the only thing , which is still personal as your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the un@@ locked mobile phone a stranger in the hands ?
most feel the responsibility .
most guests feel when they stay elsewhere .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Go@@ res &apos;s mobile phone ? &quot;
&quot; could you please tell us on Twitter , so that he can@@ did for the office of the president ? &quot;
you can now return the cell phones now .
they have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail in this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had to be presented only once with his name ; if he had told what he comes from , how his dog or his children are hot ? &quot;
&quot; imagine , you would have 150 ass@@ essments , who say : &quot; &quot; it can really keep my cell phones very well ! &quot;
how would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ done feedback system strengthens the trust significantly .
at the beginning we have made some things wrong .
it was hard to give up negatives Pak@@ ist@@ rates .
&quot; in the end , we decided to wait for both hosts and guest @-@ convic@@ tions before we presented them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we evaluated with Stan@@ ford a study . we examined , as probably it is that people trust one another , depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence . &quot;
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust people most , which are the most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less confidence we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social pre@@ lu@@ ent .
&quot; it is exciting , when one added to the call of a person -- in our case by sub@@ divisions . &quot;
&quot; if one has less than three ass@@ essments , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but one has more than ten , changing everything . &quot;
a good reputation for simil@@ ar@@ ities .
&quot; thus , the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply ro@@ oted fores@@ kins . &quot;
&quot; besides , we heard that trust is dependent on how much you cost from themselves . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one nar@@ rates too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you don &apos;t get a reply . &quot;
&quot; one tells you too much , like for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request also won &apos;t be accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there &apos;s an optimal degree of op@@ enn@@ ess , for example , &quot; T@@ olle artwork in your apartment ! I am making holiday with my family vacation . &quot;
how can I create it with design to produce this degree an op@@ enn@@ ess ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips to which topics you should write something .
our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our pre@@ judi@@ ces against strangers .
&quot; with which we did not reck@@ oned , the large amounts of people who were more than willing to deposit these pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
here you see how many people take our offer .
one can recognize three things .
first : incredibly good luck .
second : the ti@@ reless work of our team .
third : a need that had not been covered before .
our business is going very well for us .
&quot; of course , there are times when it &apos;s not all smooth . &quot;
&quot; there were guests who have allowed parties , celebrated or devast@@ ated apartments . &quot;
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the fore@@ front , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there &apos;s nothing worse than those calls . it &apos;s hurt if I think only .
&quot; dis@@ appointment , which you hear in the voice of the anus , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction had one problem from the 123 million nights . &quot;
because people confi@@ ded to each other .
&quot; if confidence , it can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made vacation in Uruguay . he suffered a heart attack there .
his host drove him to hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers tend to be busy because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Alej@@ andra are real gu@@ ardian angel , save a life , even though they don &apos;t know any correctly . &quot;
you drive one in your own car when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
&quot; because they don &apos;t want to feel lon@@ ely , they bring books over . &quot;
you can stay even longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , naturally , not every stay . &quot;
but these relationships behind the pure ATM transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled across the concept for the first time , I asked me : &quot;
how does the idea of participating with money transactions fit together ?
it is here about a commercial trade .
&quot; but now just to call &quot; rental industry , &quot; it doesn &apos;t matter . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships .
&quot; people put a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you travel nowadays , this is able to compare fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what would happen if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if at any place you have visited , a group there would wait to wait a group there , to show a thor@@ ough and a bar @-@ flying neighborhood , of which one has never heard ; &quot;
or if you could cook from a five @-@ star cook ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to privacy . &quot;
what would be if we would be able to share homes of bottom to inter@@ connecting ?
what would that look like ?
what would happen if cities would have to accept the idea of the common share ?
&quot; I imagine traveling to society and relations , instead of lon@@ el@@ iness and laun@@ cher . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea , Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces that belonged to the government &quot;
&quot; now residents , who were searching for a lead , were offered now . &quot;
&quot; were addressed to humans , their children were moved out . there were incubation programs to be started , &quot;
&quot; to start new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . today , 7@@ 85 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
there was also hospitality before .
there were similar websites in front of us .
so why has just our works ?
&quot; aside from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the correct design with the stock of confidence . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep@@ ened pre@@ judi@@ ces .
&quot; I think that &apos;s amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it when a red Maz@@ da passes to me .
we know of course that design can not solve every problem .
&quot; but if it could help us when it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design for soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you watch me ?
a faithful ? a expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , a bra@@ id l@@ la@@ undering , a terror ? &quot;
&quot; or simply delay a delay at the airport , at the airport . &quot;
this is actually true .
I don &apos;t give you the fault for your negative impressions .
&quot; such , the media are the same as I look like . &quot;
a study revealed that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably the people do not speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
for those who have never met any Muslims ; it is great to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- double Espresso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ er @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ cian , &quot;
&quot; I am a practic@@ ing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga is singing , because , I was not so born . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as homosex@@ ual man , as some of my friends , but as Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
my femin@@ ist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you afflic@@ t yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the gig was : at that time , it was a femin@@ ist declaration of independence from which I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old , felt a perfect and un@@ att@@ ain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only passive the faith of my parents .
I have with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , thought about , doub@@ ted and thought . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow to de@@ vot@@ ion with each reading of the Kor@@ ans .
the beauty of the rhythm makes me sometimes crying .
I recognize myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; ever had you ever feeling that somebody is perc@@ ep@@ tible , you complete it , and somehow she loves ? &quot;
so it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of them probably remember where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in my kitchen , looked on the screen and saw the word &quot; Express context . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , air@@ crafts in buildings , people split from buildings . &quot;
what was this ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned out quickly in indig@@ nation .
why should I do so ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , ... &quot; &quot; ji@@ had ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country was attacked , but in the N@@ u transformed me the actions of others by a citizen in a susp@@ icious . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the post@@ graduate studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I left me -- as we went sil@@ ently -- so deep it entered into my seat , and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved to our apartment in this night , in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then , I saw and read the war@@ nings of the national Islamic organisations , said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; lead you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week .
&quot; then it was Friday in that week -- the day , where Muslims were gathered to prayer . &quot;
&quot; and again , the war@@ nings : &quot; &quot; not on this first Friday , the mosque could be a destination . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered and I heard from attacks on Muslims or people who held Muslims in the Free State , and defeated them . &quot;
there really was Bran@@ dan on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something was not felt right .
&quot; because people who attacked this country , attacked our country . &quot;
I have the rage of people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
&quot; the alleg@@ ations , which are hard . &quot;
nowadays we can actually say people : &quot; there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims .
when will we go ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as a tumour in the body of the USA .
it only raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know : a mal@@ icious tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor one is only under observation .
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , path@@ ology and Olymp@@ ics . &quot;
will the closure of Mos@@ che@@ en America safer to make ?
&quot; maybe there will be a few more parking , but not to stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; regular visiting a mosque leads to people more toler@@ ant , and to show bigger participation . &quot;
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently said : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer .
&quot; the radic@@ alization process has found that he begins online . the first person is cut off from their church , even by her family , so that the extrem@@ ist group may have the true Muslims , and everyone who ab@@ hor@@ red their behaviour and ide@@ ology is a tra@@ itor or of faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS justified its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as human , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would like to add to their fore@@ sight when one recogni@@ zes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ cl@@ an with Christianity .
&quot; both groups claim their ide@@ ology , based on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but when one throws a look , she does not b@@ ade what it blo@@ wn in her &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they read these things into Scripture .
an extraordinary Ima@@ m told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she had to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said , the problem was exactly the opposite . every spirit , with whom she had spoken , brought her to silence , and told her that her anger , her mind for in@@ justice in the world , she would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger , she was a major goal for the instrumental sol@@ alization by extre@@ mi@@ sts who had a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m introduced the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of accused of anger , he demonstrated its construc@@ tive path@@ way for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS . &quot;
it was an insight like the Islam@@ opho@@ bia and my family .
but how does normal Americans work ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption affect our democracy every day on our commitment ?
&quot; a study -- basically several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear ourselves , at least three things happen . &quot;
we accept more a author@@ itarian government system , con@@ formity and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; a study shows : when some test subjects were reported in which negative about Muslims were reported , they rather than military attacks against Muslim countries , as well as circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look when the mood against Muslims were shot up after up@@ stairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it took place in the run @-@ up of the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Mos@@ lem @-@ terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manifest to the public in order to increase the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
the use of Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel the first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ting us all . &quot;
&quot; with the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about to explain itself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athl@@ ete .
&quot; he was at dental fac@@ ulty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would say to me that he was the most sweet , more generous people , whom she knew . &quot;
&quot; she visited him there , and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said : &quot;
&quot; when is my br@@ otherhood , such a sealed young man ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ zanne near her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Craig Stephen H@@ icks , she was murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who had post@@ pon@@ ed in her apartment , as with an execution , after he had posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he shot eight times in De@@ ah .
&quot; fan@@ at@@ ism can not only be imm@@ oral , but also fatal . &quot;
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
&quot; we went to the mosque , or did we stay safe at home ? &quot;
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision , because it was because of America we want to leave our children : one that would control us through fear , or one where we can do our religion free . &quot;
we decided to the mosque .
&quot; we went in silence with our son in the children &apos;s residence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , and drew my shoes , and went into the building , and what I saw , he left me . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; the im@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and welcomed our guests , as the half of the meeting were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , ath@@ ei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to join us . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I am broken together . &quot;
&quot; these people were there , because they had courage and compassion and pre@@ judi@@ ces . &quot;
what will you choose ?
what are you going to choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ at@@ ism ?
are you going to be safe at number ?
or will you connect to those that mean : we are better than that .
thank you very much .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia that you seem to hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say , that , perhaps , say that you are holding a T@@ ED@@ Talk , a reas@@ oning with deep @-@ continu@@ ity , thus an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be fool@@ ed . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I usually am as usual .
&quot; when you look on the Muslims around the world , and I did that with the greatest of the study about Muslims in all over the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want to work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am an exception in any way .
&quot; if humans appear like an exception to rule , the rule is often broken , and they are not the exception to rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
&quot; in short , what began to cra@@ fting a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . it is possible in research institutions around the world . &quot;
&quot; before the air p@@ act in our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of air@@ machines at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built live a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks . some years ago they began to fly with ro@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting cables , high speed and acceleration reach closest space . &quot;
they can also build self @-@ loaded structures .
they have learned to carry loads to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws .
&quot; today , we want to show you some of our new projects . &quot;
our aim is to cross the borders of Pos@@ sible in autonomous flight .
&quot; in order to manage a system aut@@ on@@ om , it has to know colle@@ c@@ tively , where the mobile objects are located . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , an off@@ springs of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine comp@@ ut@@ ations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available at highest levels , for example . &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two flying with a fl@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; like other starters , it is efficient , much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most popular wing@@ ers , it can float large and great benefits at starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a flip side . &quot;
a restriction of tail@@ or is that they react sensiti@@ vely to turbul@@ ences like wind@@ ar@@ cs .
we develop new controls and algorith@@ ms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn &apos;t matter in which position the optimal position will be recovered , and the performance can be improved by practic@@ ing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often represent basic abstract questions that penet@@ rate the core of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for this to know the answer to one such question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts , which gather together to viol@@ ate you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots couldn &apos;t fly remote control units that had only two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a rear skir@@ t . &quot;
we discovered that flying with only one works .
&quot; this is the mono@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically sim@@ pl@@ est remote control unit . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no valves , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , it happens very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tail@@ or . to bring it to flying , I must throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the li@@ kel@@ i@@ hood to throw it right , if all look on , is low , therefore show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the mon@@ opoly is an exercise in gen@@ ious , this machine is here , the Omni@@ head with its eight Prop@@ eller , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is symmet@@ rical .
therefore he is equivalent in its alignment .
&quot; as a result , he receives the utmost ability , &quot;
&quot; in the room to move in all directions , no matter which direction it is rot@@ ated or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some is shown in models , the rest is learned directly when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s see that .
&quot; if flying machines should be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ ellers of prop@@ eller machines .
these revol@@ ves around clock@@ wise .
and the other against clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , somewhat wrong -- a engine or prop@@ eller falls , the electronics or a battery -- may continue to fly the machine if restricted . &quot;
we will now demonstrate that by making a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration studied synthetic she@@ ar .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
&quot; we took standard micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and out@@ fit them with loc@@ alization technology and algorith@@ ms . &quot;
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no limit .
&quot; hopefully , you will motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas . &quot;
&quot; Broadway , a particularly secure machine , wants to hang on Broadway a flying lamp screen . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predic@@ t the influence of this technology . &quot;
&quot; for types , like us , the salary is in the development and the creative act . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and ench@@ anting our universe is , and that creative , smart creature allows to form them in a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the bag on the i .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes strug@@ gled together in a very far distant future . they turned into pure energy so that the mass thre@@ e@@ fold in a ten@@ se of pure energy . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up brigh@@ ter than all the stars together in all the galax@@ ies of the whole universe . &quot;
it was a very big pop .
but they didn &apos;t put their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was given into space @-@ time @-@ emotion and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ation waves .
we arrange the events at a time .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , mainly multi @-@ cell life was born on earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God raised us in -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; some 25 years ago , a group of particularly mu@@ c@@ ous -- Ra@@ i Weiss decided to build a giant laser detector by MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from the C@@ alt@@ ech -- a giant laser detector , which are caused by col@@ li@@ zing black holes . &quot;
they held most of them for crazy .
but enough people recognized it as a mad gen@@ ius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the Det@@ ector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer - Gra@@ vit@@ ation @-@ Ob@@ servatory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up time , the precision of Lig@@ o could considerably increased , which improved the detection performance enorm@@ ously . &quot;
therefore we call it Advanced Lig@@ o now .
&quot; beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run by some smaller , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the detector , the gra@@ vit@@ ation waves of the two colored black holes was through the ground . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector through .
Scott Hughes : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the departure from my to@@ d@@ ill father .
&quot; basically , these were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; all that is what I had worked , is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes , theoretical physi@@ cist on MIT . he has been studied gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes and their observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ation waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ation wave is a cr@@ us@@ ement in the composition of space and time .
&quot; when crossing the shaft , space and entire content will be stretched into a direction and into the other . &quot;
to illustr@@ ate lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often a real al@@ ber@@ y dance .
&quot; stretching and du@@ sty , stretching and du@@ sty . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak , even ridic@@ ulous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , every one of us was stretched and stressed by us . the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is called 20 N@@ ul@@ ls following the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . this reason , the Lig@@ o staff explained for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with five kilometers long laser detector , and this is already absurd , this length should be measured to less than a thou@@ sand@@ th of the radius of a nuclear power . that is gr@@ ot@@ es@@ k . &quot;
at the end of his classic text on Gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder L@@ IG@@ Os , pursu@@ ing hunting according to the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties with the construction of such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; however , physi@@ cists are inv@@ alu@@ able and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
return to Lig@@ o . Scott claims that Lig@@ o be more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what that means .
&quot; clear light has a wave length , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell phones . &quot;
that &apos;s quite practical . because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you .
during killing is that different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; therefore it is very difficult , actually impossible to manufacture a picture of things , which mean to you very much : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain properties like pitch , rhythm , and volume to close to the story behind . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; lob@@ ster Bob , &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we can do with them no simple pictures of objects in all .
&quot; by doing changes in am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are measured in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so , when we convert wave pattern in sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; the Gra@@ vit@@ ation could listen to us about the coll@@ ision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has already been employed for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply circul@@ ate : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; turn the two body very quickly , you can hear the same cir@@ ps with an additional sound change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement , distinct in the wav@@ e@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date I never forget it -- heard Lig@@ o the following : &#91; sur@@ ren@@ dering sound &#93; J@@ no one knows what he must hear , recognis@@ es this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes , each as fast as the rods of your sha@@ ker . &quot;
AA : we think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in all , one with a mass of 29 s@@ uns , the other with a mass of 36 s@@ uns , revol@@ ve one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
put these forces in front of them .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
there is the lasting significance of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible before .
on this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible .
much in all we can -- practically or basically -- do not see .
&quot; a Super@@ nova , for example . I would like to know why explo@@ ding stars in super@@ nov@@ ae explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about the All .
&quot; but the exciting physical int@@ ages happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ation waves penet@@ rate iron , as it would be transparent glass . the Ur@@ b@@ all : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the urine is covered by its own lat@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ation waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and most import@@ antly , I &apos;m optimi@@ stic that we have never seen in all things we &apos;ve never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things we can only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o took place in the first run of things we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Evans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this subject : me : the kind of stars that bring up black holes , as Lig@@ o they are observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient and ancient times . the black holes are so called the Sau@@ ri@@ pen@@ bone for our archaeological work . &quot;
Lig@@ o enables us to view a completely different angle of view on the events in all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , as we went out of this chaos . &quot;
&quot; AA : the challenge is now , as brave as possible . &quot;
thanks to Lig@@ o we know how to build great detectors and l@@ ur@@ king the cos@@ mos of the cos@@ mos .
we need ideas for new Ob@@ serv@@ atories -- a brand new generation of Ob@@ serv@@ atories on Earth and All .
&quot; for what could be more beautiful , than to listen to the urine itself ? &quot;
now the time is great dreams .
do you dream with us .
thanks .
some time I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year , I would say &quot; Yes ! &quot; I was afraid of whom I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me in un@@ pleasant situations , I forced me &quot; Yes &quot; to say . &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I like to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
would I just want to play with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a mad thing happened : exactly what to do , I was afraid , did my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear , to keep speaking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes , &quot; my life changed . &quot;
&quot; yes &quot; &quot; changed me . &quot;
&quot; but there was a certain Yes that changed my life , un@@ expect@@ edly . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , called all &quot; Bi@@ bs &quot; for un@@ explained reasons , &quot;
as a wa@@ iter it would be a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my pur@@ ge . &quot;
she once asked her if I could play with her when I was at the jump and I said : &quot; yes . &quot;
this was the beginning
&quot; of a new life setting in my family . from there I swear to always to play with them , once you have done me . no matter what I am doing right , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I stri@@ ve very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an intri@@ gu@@ ing side effect : I was actually completely understood that the &quot; Yes &quot; sin@@ ages to play with my children my career .
I have a real dream job .
I am writing author . I think things look up for life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I read more productive television .
I &apos;m doing television in a large style .
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours TV . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each show features hundreds of jobs , which did not exist before . &quot;
the budget for one month &apos;s episode can be between three and six million dollars .
let &apos;s say five .
&quot; a new episode , every nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three shows that are simultaneously produced in production , sometimes four , 16 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series runs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series will run in 256 regions in 256 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts which I have created ourselves , and not only produced , so still ob@@ tru@@ sive . I must find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans about the camp fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours TV , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing this ?
&quot; no one , therefore I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to im@@ press you .
I tell it because I know what you think if the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you &apos;re now a company , a country or a class@@ room to take me seriously if I say of work , that you may not only understand that I &apos;m not just around the computer when I say : I understand that there is no dream at a dream job . &quot;
&quot; everything is a job , all work , everything reality , all blood , everything per@@ spiration -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; if I am absorbed into the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work creates a land from nothing .
&quot; it is , when I set up the troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; as a dream , you would like a high tone , then a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ yon@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechan@@ ically , exhau@@ sting and in@@ tox@@ ic@@ ating , fun and maternal , clin@@ ically and reasonable , cruel and reasonable . and the best of it is the sum . &quot;
there is so a change in me when working is well running .
&quot; a sum@@ s starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the sum@@ s li@@ stens like a busy street , I could go for ever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I tell them the sum that I speak about writing that writing was made me pleasure . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sum@@ s -- when I began working with television production , when I started working and work and work to create , create , create and collabor@@ ate , I discovered this thing , this sum , this energy . the sum@@ s ! &quot;
the sum@@ s is more than writing .
the sum@@ s is action and activity . the sum@@ s is a drug .
the sum@@ s is music . the sum@@ s is light and air .
the sum of God is the voice of God in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , you cannot stri@@ ve differently than size . &quot;
&quot; feeling , not different to achieve , regardless of size , no matter what price is . &quot;
this is called sum@@ s .
&quot; or perhaps , it also signi@@ fies an workflow . &quot;
perhaps it is called gen@@ ius .
perhaps it &apos;s called E@@ go .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not for failure , and I only know that I love the sum . &quot;
&quot; I will just say to you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to ask it into question . &quot;
&quot; the more so successful I become , the more ship@@ ments , the more the more incid@@ entally , the more work they are , the more things I do , the more the more I write , the more expectations I have history , the more expectations it gives . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country , I create the marathon , I run , the army , the army , the high sound , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sum@@ s .
I need the sum@@ s . I am the sum@@ s .
am I only this sum@@ s ?
and then the sum@@ s stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ run , exagger@@ ated , over@@ run . &quot;
the sum stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title .
Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there but you can write my N@@ anny .
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Bi@@ bs , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da . &quot; &quot;
it is the children of a titanium .
they are Baby @-@ titanium .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when the sum@@ s heard . &quot;
the sum@@ s of the engine stopped .
I don &apos;t loved my work anymore . the engine was out .
the sum@@ s didn &apos;t come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same titanium work , 15 hours @-@ days , performed weekends , no pen@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ating , a Titan sleeps not , is not on with all your heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no sum@@ s .
in me silence was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a show @-@ Titan
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the sum@@ s and the sum@@ s I was .
&quot; so , what do you do if that is what you do , the work you love , suddenly f@@ aded ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think : &quot; loc@@ ust@@ l you , stupid author &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but you know , you do it , you &apos;re working , one loves to be a teacher , a banker to be a mother , a painter , Bill gates , and knows how to feel the sum@@ s when the sum stopped , who is one then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I like ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart li@@ stens , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states @-@ wa@@ it@@ in &quot; ask me a question .
&quot; I am on the way out , late and she says : &quot; Mama , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I will tell no , than two things will be aware of : &quot;
&quot; first of all , I have to say Yes to all and secondly , she didn &apos;t called me &quot; Bi@@ b . &quot; &quot;
they are called anyone more &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it if I &apos;m working Titan &apos;s and my bu@@ zz , and here everything changes my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
that is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters reject this , we laugh much and I read completely dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic , in sol@@ itude and in lack of the sum , I can do nothing but to stop . &quot;
I am focused .
I &apos;m silent .
&quot; the country , I create the marathon , I run the marathon , the army , the army , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists are stick@@ y fingers and wet k@@ is@@ ses , tender voices , wax cra@@ cks and the song in which it can leave , or whatever the girl in &quot; Die Eis@@ queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something in me dis@@ solves .
a mental door is going on and an energy ub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediately , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the sum@@ s comes back slowly .
&quot; no lou@@ dness , hardly there , it is quiet , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is here . &quot;
&quot; not the sum@@ s , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel when I would know a magic mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
there is something we &apos;ve forgotten .
&quot; the sum@@ s , the work@@ men , the Titan@@ ens@@ um@@ men , is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I say to you , who I am , if I am using me using broad@@ casts and television lessons , and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sum is no power and it is not work specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real Sum@@ men depends on love .
the sum is the stream that comes from the vitality .
the real Sum@@ men is self @-@ awareness and peace .
&quot; the real Sum@@ men igno@@ res the pressure of history , which are to be experiencing tasks , expect@@ ation and pressure . &quot;
real sum@@ s is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum@@ s is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps whis@@ pered me the wrong words , because what God told me that I am a Titan am ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; once my child wants to play with me , I will say Yes . &quot;
&quot; I am doing this rule , so I can free myself as workouts from any debt . &quot;
&quot; it is a law , I have no other choice . I don &apos;t have any other choice if I want to hear the sum@@ s again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not well in play , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t play for a sat@@ in , like working . &quot;
&quot; the truth is hurt , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I rather am at work as at home .
&quot; this confession is painful , because what a person rather works than to be home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I think . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
&quot; none of them , is none of it . &quot;
&quot; we ras@@ en around the garden , and back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we cut soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; I feel greater stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
always I &apos;m getting ready for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children tell me how to live , and the sum@@ s of the universe ful@@ fil@@ s me . &quot;
&quot; I play and play , until I ask myself : why did we stop playing with the playing ? &quot;
&quot; you can also ! tell them Yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; maybe you &apos;ll keep me for na@@ ive , for a meeting . &quot;
&quot; you probably have right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; most little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , up to them that they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; there are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ae@@ fer or bis@@ cuit replaces me .
&quot; and my Teen@@ ie @-@ daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more needs not need . &quot;
everyone can get 15 minutes on a piece by yourself on a bad mood !
15 minutes on the track !
&quot; no mobile , no washing , no di@@ stra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the kids get ready . &quot;
there are 15 minutes in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ h@@ lo@@ h@@ are , my world . there must not be the children . it is to feel the sum to have a place for his soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with their own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
around &quot; Play &quot; in general .
indul@@ ge in the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find it out and keep it away .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I wins . friends meet , reading books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I have abandoned , when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training as I wanted to sur@@ pass more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes on a piece , why do not allow for 15 minutes to allow yourself ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the sum@@ s came back in my spare time . the sum@@ s appears to return if I &apos;m not working .
work not works without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door open up and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown tune , it fills me and my soul . I lead me to new ideas . I use it into full moves and love my work again . &quot;
I like the sum@@ s but I don &apos;t love it .
I don &apos;t need it .
I &apos;m not the sum@@ s that Sum@@ men is not me ... not anymore .
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and stick@@ y fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
that is now my sum .
the sum@@ s of life .
the sum@@ s of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; it is a s@@ na@@ vel that I &apos;m a Titan , I &apos;ve never seen a Titan , who plays the journey to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said Yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything in hand . my brain is still working . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clear@@ er my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sum@@ s . the country , I run , the marathon , I run , the tro@@ op , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s , the sum@@ s of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more makes this unusual , be@@ ating , naked and new feeling in me . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sum@@ s , the more I know who I am . &quot;
I am writing author . I think things I wake up for life .
&quot; this belongs to the job , that means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job was supposed to be a little dream .
I said &quot; Yes &quot; to less work and more games .
Titan@@ es have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thanks beautiful .
I am neuro@@ surgical .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies . &quot;
&quot; I know how to change your life from a second to the other , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgery it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other bodies , has a very low capacity to self @-@ healing healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious violations of the central nervous system patients often have a permanent , heavy han@@ dicap . &quot;
that &apos;s probably the reason why I was functional neuro@@ surgical .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
&quot; a doctor , who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical actions . &quot;
&quot; certainly , they have heard from one of the most well known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stim@@ ulation . &quot; it im@@ planted a electro@@ de deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neur@@ ons so that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s disease which suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I want to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help yourself . &quot;
the history began 15 years ago .
at the time I was an executive board and worked day and night .
I often provided patients with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
you have to imagine that the brain has shi@@ fted the brain with skul@@ ls @-@ brain trau@@ mat@@ a and the skull pressure .
&quot; to save lives , one must decrease the skull pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen cereb@@ ral mass .
&quot; instead of throwing brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a biolog@@ ist and brain mass . &quot;
what do I mean by this ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece , comparable to very small children , which will be taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right food , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
that &apos;s what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean François abolished Jean François . &quot;
that looked under his micro@@ scope .
that was a great surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; maybe you still know of the bi@@ ologic studies that stem cells are un@@ ripe , which can turn into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has tri@@ stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small niche of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal St@@ em C@@ ells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like a stem cells but changed differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ b@@ lec@@ ort@@ in @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ rum @-@ rin@@ dless cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the course of the fo@@ etus , they ensure the folding of the brain . &quot;
but why do they stay us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe she is taking part in the healing of brain , as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries . &quot;
but that is not so safe .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
&quot; we stand in front of a potential cell source , enabling the brain allocation . &quot;
we had to prove that .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ lingu@@ istic area and then cultiv@@ ate cells precisely as cul@@ tured as Jean @-@ François did
and they then colour to mark them to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we im@@ planted them on the basis of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transpl@@ antation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ spl@@ antation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we im@@ planted these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we im@@ planted the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with monkeys . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we im@@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that they had been removed after a few weeks , they would go back home . the room is already occupied , they will not be needed there , so they will disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we had an injury and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now they continued to get cells -- they grew up ne@@ ural neur@@ ons .
here you see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that were re@@ im@@ planted .
the proof they show are these small points . these are the cells we are colored in vitro in the culture .
we could not stop here .
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take animal pellets for a tablet .
they did it very well .
&quot; when they had reached a stable skill level , we had the engine mot@@ echnology range in motor@@ ised Cort@@ ex . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could not move their hand anymore . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen with people , they r@@ ushed spont@@ aneously up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover themselves with the help of plastic bra@@ in@@ mechanisms . they are re@@ covering to a certain degree as the monkeys .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand , they see the monkey , which over@@ took spont@@ aneously . &quot;
it can bring about 40 % to 50 % of its initial performance from violation of injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , see when we im@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after irrit@@ ation transpl@@ antation . &quot;
I can tell you that was very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found much more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze it and then use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ology models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , as the human brain has the means to cure itself . &quot;
thank you very much .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can &apos;t need . &quot;
I definitely go .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are , before you can start clinical trials on humans . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the greatest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies .
BG : this is understand@@ able that the brain is very del@@ ik@@ at etc .
&quot; J@@ B : yeah , but it needs a long time , a lot of patience and a nearly professional team . &quot;
BG : look into the future -- you have finished research and tried to obtain permission from the start of clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future as many years it may come to the hospital and this therapy will be available .
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
initially it depends on the approval of the clinical trial .
will it allow us to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multic@@ enter study . &quot;
&quot; first , one has to re@@ prove that it is useful before you can offer these treatment . &quot;
BG : and that it is sure of course . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thank you for visiting T@@ ED and that you have told us about it .
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
&quot; in the West , we are making a great mistake in the West . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy than the frag@@ ile plant that is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as an un@@ changing circumstances .
we believe capitalism inev@@ it@@ ably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great desc@@ endant in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while the policy is completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is weak with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not as@@ certain@@ ed the austerity programmes that had been materi@@ alised in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment , I thought that there might be no better just@@ ification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my favorite friends who repeatedly said that democracy would change if they would change anything . &quot;
at this point I would like to present an economical model for a true democracy .
&quot; I ask you to believe in together with me again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group of a mistake , we could save democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sic democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are brick , our future glo@@ omy and our great , new technologies . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting conflict that currently is threatened with our host . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the debt mountain , who acc@@ uses his long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt of debt , &quot;
but few know his dy@@ mus .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which belongs to the inher@@ ent as@@ par@@ agus and concert , however , which would be too anxi@@ ous to wear it where it would be productive and income to produce all of the things that kind of mankind is urg@@ ently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , in the United States , in England and in the euro@@ zone , 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of producing goods , such as industrial facilities , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 trillion US dollars would be compared to much money till one compar@@ es it with 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars , which lay around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to rub except the stock ex@@ changes and the real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital forms the twin summit , which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result are stag@@ n@@ ating wages , more than one quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe , and therefore , a low overall economic demand , which may not invest in which they do not invest in which they could not invest . exactly like Ö@@ di@@ pus Father , who would kill him , if he is able to kill him . &quot;
&quot; un@@ intenti@@ onally , the circumstances suggest that they kill him . &quot;
that is my shar@@ k with capitalism --
&quot; its extremely poll@@ uted art . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve human talents and develop particularly all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth . &quot;
so democracy is the solution ?
I think so . but before we proceed : what do we understand under democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended too many of course --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to min@@ ate the job value of ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these inclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it was depri@@ ved of the working arms , but not only the right to freedom of expression , but rather important and crucial , which they gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voting rights in question of state powers . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not have long been kept for long --
&quot; like a candle that sh@@ ines very bright , it also has burned up quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our present liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Magna Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the US constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Cart@@ a which ultimately became a stat@@ ute for ruling . &quot;
&quot; for the liberal democracy only came out when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible , and the democratic process was dra@@ fted to politics , so the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , an in@@ ex@@ orable struggle between the two , and the economy gradually entering politics and dis@@ ma@@ stered them . &quot;
do you wonder why the politicians are not more so earlier ?
it is not in a de@@ generation of their DNA .
&quot; it is estimated that one can be in the government nowadays , and still not in power because the power of politics comes in the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hair with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is like a herd of pre@@ dat@@ ory animals , which is so sustainable the animals , of which they are nourished , dec@@ im@@ ated , so that they were hungry at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far @-@ kan@@ ni@@ b@@ alized , that it grows through the self @-@ caused economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations increases , political goods will rise , the overall economic demand , and the general manager of the corporations are anxi@@ ous to invest the cash of their businesses . &quot;
&quot; ever successful of capitalism the &quot; demos &quot; &#91; the people &#93; exp@@ els from democracy , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the waste of human labour and welfare of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if that &apos;s true , it is obvious that we have to bring back the politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; control the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marx@@ ist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very strange .
&quot; the doctrine from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be , that the working poor can only recover through a miracle , as in ancient Athens , without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : creating the working arms !
capitalism does it to be replaced by low cost of low automation through automation and robot .
&quot; the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas , the automation of the twin summit can be higher , the wast@@ age increases , and the social conflicts deeper , as it is very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so , we need to transform the economy and re@@ united the areas of economy and politics , and make sure we will be more democratic , otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ atie , which lets the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentation . &quot;
&quot; so the question is not , whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements , which he has produced . &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether it resem@@ bles capitalism by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; &quot; matrix , &quot; &quot; or something that the company is stuck in the exploration of the universe , or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ en@@ ians &quot; Ag@@ ora , &quot; in long conversations with the sense of life . &quot;
I think we may be optimi@@ stic .
&quot; so what would it be like , how could it look like this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to call you shortly , some examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : ask a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital is next to you from a workplace to the next , and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and revenues come from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely out@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; no distinction is no distinction between those who belong to the company , but do not belong in it , but the company does not belong to which the company does not belong to which the company does not belong to capital and work , no major g@@ aps between investment and savings , and ultimately not a recep@@ tive twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the area of global political economy , please indicate that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate in a universal , global , digital currency , which is issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all mankind . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that the world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pay the sum of equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund has invested in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment is rare . &quot;
this is no new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical resources to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially in the background of a unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ally , in which they privileged individuals , and mar@@ x@@ istic because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the tr@@ ash of history , and key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
are we w@@ aking up in such a world
or will we drop in a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
&quot; the answer depends on how we choose together politically . &quot;
it is in our hands and we do it better democratic .
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you give yourself a liber@@ t@@ arian Mar@@ xi@@ sten in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant .
&quot; the reason for re@@ unification of politics and economy ... Do we do not do that , the technological development will generate a massive decline in total economic demand which Larry Sum@@ mers referred to as &quot; long @-@ term stag@@ nation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thanks to the transmission of this crisis of a part of Earth on the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abil@@ ise our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also the countries whose interest in liber@@ ally democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is accurate , Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I &apos;m totally wir@@ r . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are too . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a sort of philosoph@@ ical statement -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein , who said that . BG : in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers , you have very clearly said what you keep from the point of view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a big dimension of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the registration of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited the democracy in politics during the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- a completely democr@@ atically @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in a certain extent , if I may say that such pro@@ voc@@ ative , China resem@@ bles China today to the 19th century England . &quot;
&quot; -- Do you remember -- we tend to associate liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , as John Stuart Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed in China , resem@@ bles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to hand in China , to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I &apos;m sure that many listen@@ ers are curious to experience your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I guess that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from personal view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , that a massive reduction line through the euro@@ zone began to say , and continuing to pass through the Eurozone , and continues to withstand the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek demonstration -- by the way , the first proposal was to reveal this den@@ ial -- &quot;
&quot; to make it correct . unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , continues to deny the den@@ ial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you tried to obtain a economic system that is not able to get li@@ fel@@ ong through political will and auth@@ ari@@ an@@ ism , it may be put out a while , but if the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt@@ ly and de@@ structive . &quot;
BG : what will you see ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its structure .
BG : did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- seri@@ ousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in a so @-@ called situation , claims that he did not have any mistakes , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake had to be submitted to the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the Bank@@ ors to find a common solution .
but that was not .
they only wanted to bring our government just because they did not want to deal with the sub@@ jec@@ tives who ran through the Eurozone .
they didn &apos;t want to admit that they carried out a cat@@ astro@@ phic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost a third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the Tro@@ ika , who has imposed this policy , revealed : &quot; that was a col@@ os@@ sal@@ er error . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all that , and despite the aggressive mood of the talks , you seem to be quite a pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone , opposite someone who lives and love Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro area did not survive .
&quot; for if they did not survive , the released flying forces will be ro@@ mon@@ astic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have dis@@ astro@@ us consequences for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after that it seems to me , it will be also unbe@@ ar@@ able for the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;re going wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much that you were at T@@ ED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard the most yet , although it is probably responsible for 22 @-@ moderate minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
this goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is the senior employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the TV @-@ production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , sl@@ ender , has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon .
&quot; of course , this is very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are already so many TV series that Roy can &apos;t choose any .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that turn right on this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the evaluation goes from 1 to 10 , and the height shows how many shows this evaluation are received . &quot;
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then one has a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Breaking Bath , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that you &apos;re addic@@ ted , where , after one looked after a season , your brain asks : &quot; where is there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going to do at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I don &apos;t need special intelligence to under@@ take &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes himself more thoughts about the middle expression , the average TV -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they don &apos;t inspire them . &quot;
so he must make sure that he really is on the right side .
&quot; pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something that &apos;s why Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs great success , so he holds a contest . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and if there is Amazon for free things , you can get involved , right ? &quot;
&quot; millions of viewers are looking at these episodes , too . &quot;
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
Roy and his team is watched by Roy and his team .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you turn out what parts you ski@@ ps or look again . &quot;
&quot; collect millions of data to decide with these data , which show they should produce . &quot;
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process this and from this results the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com about four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that no many can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lands with 7,5 -- therefore something on average , but not just what Roy and his team worked out . &quot;
&quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has pl@@ az@@ ed a top show by data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , manager for program design of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking for this a super @-@ show and he uses data , but he does it something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of a competition , he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give the shows , their course , what shows it etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewers : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had gathered all the parts together they entered a car and decided not to make a Sit@@ com about four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; receives a 9,1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted .
&quot; of course , the question is : what is happening here ? &quot;
&quot; two very competent , data experienced companies . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data , and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
why is that ?
because logic somehow states that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , then you should make a good choice . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
optimized with a very powerful computer .
&quot; the Min@@ de@@ ste , what one can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work so it is something terri@@ fying because we are living in a time , in which we have more and more statistics to meet serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software . come in touch , you &apos;re in prison . &quot;
&quot; if a man is in prison in the US and asking for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not . &quot;
&quot; just as at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but rather than decide whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person is good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate TV , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that these data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
it does not always produce the best results . it is not aware that a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of the most experienced companies are also false .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can be fore@@ seen through data analysis of flu , the lim@@ lim@@ men , -- through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news station . the success gi@@ p@@ fel@@ ted in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked fine , year around year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it was simply not working , this was once again a sensation , including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these errors , data are in decisions of life a -- in the workplace , with legal reasons , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather ensure that data are helpful .
I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ supported gen@@ etics -- an area where some very smart people can use un@@ imagin@@ able many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy
&quot; or the development of a drug . over the years , I recognized some samples using the difference between successful decisions based on data and non @-@ successful decisions . this pattern should be dis@@ semin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if you have a complex problem , you do need two things : &quot;
&quot; once you dis@@ assemble this problem in its components , so you can analyse the items ; as a second , put the single parts together to hold a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help relie@@ ve a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
&quot; they are not suitable to re @-@ establish the parts , and then come to a decision . &quot;
there is another tool and we all have it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to put together again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it &apos;s the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think , Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong also in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to understand their audience better what they could not have been capable of . but the decision , how to make all these parts , set up again and see a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; that was not in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show - what meant they had a big personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; they tell us the data .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data are helpful for better choices , but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and that is not forgotten , this device is quite useful . &quot;
thanks to you ...
&quot; before sending data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it &apos;s also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or No question you will only shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- exactly here in this moment .
I &apos;ll get it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have listened to the ball in the night . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the foundation .
&quot; so , perhaps the ball will be wis@@ er and wis@@ er and wis@@ er . ultimately it is in us to meet decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as a encouraging news , that despite the great amount of data still paid to make decisions , an expert in what you do , and risks go . &quot;
&quot; by the end , it is not the data , but the risks where you can land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks beautiful .
