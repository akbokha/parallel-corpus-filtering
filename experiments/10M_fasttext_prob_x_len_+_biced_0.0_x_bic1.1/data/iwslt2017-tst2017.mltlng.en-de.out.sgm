<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA reportedly heard illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a permanent impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">In this he describes a disastrous US intelligence operation in which the CIA was literally drafted for a nuclear bomb.</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know whom the chapter isn't pleased?</seg>
<seg id="9">The US government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government counts with Risen and called him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol for the design of the government, Whistleblower to condemn and journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional Law, the media have the right to publish more secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"however, it is impossible to apply this right when media is not able to protect this information, and if they cannot protect their identity, they will be given."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government forged Risen, he did something that had already done a lot of courageous journalists before him: he refused, and said that he would prefer to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen was thus living with risk to go into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something unusual happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though it had been essential for years that it would be essential for their case, the government's demands were dropped by Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason: in the time of electronic monitoring, reporters and sources can always hide less."</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of failing and ravans to correct statements, you could also do his digital Footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his permission, concerned his phone calls for home,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his E-Mail data, financial and banetic information, its credit card, and even travel information with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of these information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risk to condemn."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">President Obama promised to protect Whistleblower. but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him.</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government has become too much of their work as home."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result that a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, we set the press work on the playing, which should be protected by the first constitutional law, because the government has more possibilities to express all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"just like technology of the government allowed to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to protect their sources better."</seg>
<seg id="29">"indeed, they may take that from the moment in which they contact contact, rather than in the descendant, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which had not yet been written as Risen, and it is essentially more secure than normal e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source transition system for Whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet renowned, which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, which I have been working out today."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site, just as the Washington Post here."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send documents, like in any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, at which the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot provide more information in secret services, and many of the information that would like to request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom of the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments develop new spying technologies all over the world that all endanger ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to ensure that there are not only technology experts, like Edward Snowden, have a possibility to put iniquities. it is just as important that we protect the next Whistleblower."</seg>
<seg id="39">"he wants to know about abuse by soldiers with the supply of soldiers. or the next environmental worker, the alarm will strike the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us before the next financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only done for those who want to uncover the crimes, but to protect our fundamental rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">"[on April 3, 2016, the largest data leck of history was released.] [the" Panama Papers "reveal," "Panama Papers" "[...] [we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to have an explanation.] this week, we asked Robert Palmer by Global Witness to have an explanation.] this week we were asked by news about a leak of 11 million documents in Panama's local law firm Mosseca."</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents are a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we will get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms such as Moschbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"actually, we actually see e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This already led to the first very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland Prime Minister has stepped down.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bar al-Assad stationed companies in tax havens has."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a track of $2 billion to Russian President Vladimir Putin leads to a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people and others who wait nervous to the next release, and to the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it shines away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should it be?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful in the situation are to hide their wealth in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as healthcare, education, streets."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organisation, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss media and leading politicians, such as secret tax havases are used to hide and wear their assets -- something that we have been discussing and unveil for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will seem very confusing this whole world, and it's hard to understand how these tax haven't work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine a Matrjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so, one company has a company in another company, in another company that makes it almost impossible to really understand who behind these bloilds."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecutions and tax authorities, as well as journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I also find it interesting that there are less reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there was no prominent American Americans who have occurred in these revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now it is not that there are not enough Americans, who hide their wealth in havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that this tax haven't work, Mosseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck of the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would have much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that you need less information in some US states to use less information to establish a company than to get a librisk reference."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees from school children to block school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">"it has permitted cheaters, especially vulnerable investors."</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects us all.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to figure out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covered investigator to the offices of 13 Lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigators gave himself as an African ministers, who wanted to bring the suspect money into the US to buy a yacht to buy a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked us that everyone would make suggestions about a lawyer in our investigator as he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all pre-preaching. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no emancipation was given to the money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important to consider that not as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has underlining our secret investigation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single top position, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it's about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to cope with this, we need to change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change rules in order to make this kind of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this sound really sound, as if we could not do anything about it; as if nothing has ever changed, as if it is always the wealthy and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a borrowed optimist I really see that something has begun to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen more transparency to more transparency, regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the theme was political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at national level, who really is behind companies in Europe, and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US would go back here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have inserted a bill of legislative law, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havases, is used as a means to ensure visibility in the USA and globally for more transparency."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for changes.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people, which will be angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlights."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need managers in the economy which stand up and say: "Intransparent is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"we need leading politicians who realize the problem, and use it to terminate this kind of intransparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finish the Intransparent, which enables us to finish this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story how I have been kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Mazdas.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I had completed my design studies, I made a home farm."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stayed and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my art works.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. thereafter he would go to the peace of peace.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me about how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse," I don't know. "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought:" Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just met him! he says he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he really is planning. I don't want to land in the boot of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an aerial view. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," eh, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night, I was lying in bed, I stared to the blanket and thought:" Oh man! what did I go before me? "</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild living in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if it is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of the bed, at Zehenpointed at the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the work of art, which he bought by me, hung today in his classroom. he is now teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has changed my view angle completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood, were actually friends who were waiting only to be discovered?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"people on my air matoze to lodge, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the aerial view."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let us make a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost pleading, my roommates and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity is able to create fear in fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommates Brian Chesky:" "Brian, I have over how we could earn something to earn. our apartment becomes a designer Bed and Breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk inclusive, a mattress and every morning breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so called "airmatchze and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep on a wood floor for 20 dollars.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I'm sure that our cheese ham Omelon was completely different, because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest, and the door to the castle fell, stiff Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">We just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and could pay our rental?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came in rolls.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to figure out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented the investors:" we want to create a website, on which people publicly shared images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closing when you visit. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"on the Internet, they can then invite the foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would burn.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not do it.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one who is still in solace, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">"because we, as children, have learned that foreigners are dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="146">"if one has a problem, you are inside the things you can do. we could designate."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptic -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust through its design, between people who never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design be made so anything?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a taste, what degrees trust we stricken."</seg>
<seg id="152">It's a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Keep your thumbs up if you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">"now, I would like to unlocking your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone your left seat.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight of panic, which you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts the host when they open the door."</seg>
<seg id="158">"the only thing, which is still personal as your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the unlocked mobile phone a stranger in the hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most guests feel when they stay elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores's mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">"could you please tell us on Twitter, so that he candid for the office of the president?"</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have experienced now what kind of confidence we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail in this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had to be presented only once with his name; if he had told what he comes from, how his dog or his children are hot?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine, you would have 150 assessments, who say:" "it can really keep my cell phones very well!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel then if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-done feedback system strengthens the trust significantly.</seg>
<seg id="173">At the beginning we have made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard to give up negatives Pakistrates.</seg>
<seg id="175">"in the end, we decided to wait for both hosts and guest-convictions before we presented them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we evaluated with Stanford a study. we examined, as probably it is that people trust one another, depending on how much they are in terms of age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust people most, which are the most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less confidence we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social preluent.</seg>
<seg id="181">"it is exciting, when one added to the call of a person -- in our case by subdivisions."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three assessments, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but one has more than ten, changing everything."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation for similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">"thus, the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted foreskins."</seg>
<seg id="186">"besides, we heard that trust is dependent on how much you cost from themselves."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one narrates too little, like" Hi!, "you don't get a reply."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you too much, like for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request also won't be accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there's an optimal degree of openness, for example," Tolle artwork in your apartment! I am making holiday with my family vacation. "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create it with design to produce this degree an openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips to which topics you should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on hope that the correct design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">"with which we did not reckoned, the large amounts of people who were more than willing to deposit these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people take our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">One can recognize three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">First: incredibly good luck.</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">Our business is going very well for us.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when it's not all smooth."</seg>
<seg id="202">"there were guests who have allowed parties, celebrated or devastated apartments."</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There's nothing worse than those calls. it's hurt if I think only.</seg>
<seg id="207">"disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the anus, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction had one problem from the 123 million nights."</seg>
<seg id="209">Because people confided to each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if confidence, it can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made vacation in Uruguay. he suffered a heart attack there.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers tend to be busy because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angel, save a life, even though they don't know any correctly."</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can stay even longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, naturally, not every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relationships behind the pure ATM transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled across the concept for the first time, I asked me:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of participating with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is here about a commercial trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now just to call" rental industry, "it doesn't matter."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trading that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of themselves, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you travel nowadays, this is able to compare fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What would happen if traveling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you have visited, a group there would wait to wait a group there, to show a thorough and a bar-flying neighborhood, of which one has never heard;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could cook from a five-star cook?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What would be if we would be able to share homes of bottom to interconnecting?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What would happen if cities would have to accept the idea of the common share?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine traveling to society and relations, instead of loneliness and launcher."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea, Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces that belonged to the government"</seg>
<seg id="240">"now residents, who were searching for a lead, were offered now."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were addressed to humans, their children were moved out. there were incubation programs to be started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to start new start-ups in the Share economy. today, 785 000 people in 191 countries will be a guest of a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy about how it was taught us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has just our works?</seg>
<seg id="248">"aside from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the correct design with the stock of confidence."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deepened prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I think that's amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it when a red Mazda passes to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design can not solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us when it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design for soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you watch me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A faithful? a expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, a braid llaundering, a terror?"</seg>
<seg id="260">"or simply delay a delay at the airport, at the airport."</seg>
<seg id="261">This is actually true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the fault for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">"such, the media are the same as I look like."</seg>
<seg id="264">A study revealed that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably the people do not speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For those who have never met any Muslims; it is great to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- double Espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I'm introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchter-Fitness-Fanatician,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga is singing, because, I was not so born."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I met the decision to ousted me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as homosexual man, as some of my friends, but as Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you afflict yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the gig was: at that time, it was a feminist declaration of independence from which I felt as 17-year-old, felt a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passive the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, thought about, doubted and thought."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow to devotion with each reading of the Korans.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm makes me sometimes crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"ever had you ever feeling that somebody is perceptible, you complete it, and somehow she loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">So it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of them probably remember where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in my kitchen, looked on the screen and saw the word" Express context. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircrafts in buildings, people split from buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was this?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned out quickly in indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do so?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:" "Muslim terrorists"... ""... "in the name of Islam...,..." "jihad...", "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country was attacked, but in the Nu transformed me the actions of others by a citizen in a suspicious."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Middle East of the USA to move into a new city and begin with the postgraduate studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I left me -- as we went silently -- so deep it entered into my seat, and I was afraid to be recognized as the Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved to our apartment in this night, in a new town in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then, I saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, said:" be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Be careful, "" lead you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">"then it was Friday in that week -- the day, where Muslims were gathered to prayer."</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again, the warnings:" "not on this first Friday, the mosque could be a destination."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"feelings were understandably unfiltered and I heard from attacks on Muslims or people who held Muslims in the Free State, and defeated them."</seg>
<seg id="311">There really was Brandan on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something was not felt right.</seg>
<seg id="314">"because people who attacked this country, attacked our country."</seg>
<seg id="315">I have the rage of people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">"the allegations, which are hard."</seg>
<seg id="320">Nowadays we can actually say people: "there is a problem in this country -- it means Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we go? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as a tumour in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">It only raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know: a malicious tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor one is only under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">Muslims are inventors and teachers, pathology and Olympics. "</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of Moscheen America safer to make?</seg>
<seg id="331">"maybe there will be a few more parking, but not to stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"regular visiting a mosque leads to people more tolerant, and to show bigger participation."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently said: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their cellar or in the bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"the radicalization process has found that he begins online. the first person is cut off from their church, even by her family, so that the extremist group may have the true Muslims, and everyone who abhorred their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or of faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS justified its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as human, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would like to add to their foresight when one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-clan with Christianity.</seg>

<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An extraordinary Imam told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she had to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said, the problem was exactly the opposite. every spirit, with whom she had spoken, brought her to silence, and told her that her anger, her mind for injustice in the world, she would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had given her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumental solalization by extremists who had a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam introduced the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accused of anger, he demonstrated its constructive pathway for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight like the Islamophobia and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does normal Americans work?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption affect our democracy every day on our commitment?</seg>
<seg id="358">"a study -- basically several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear ourselves, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">We accept more a authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudices. "</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows: when some test subjects were reported in which negative about Muslims were reported, they rather than military attacks against Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the Rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look when the mood against Muslims were shot up after upstairs -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It took place in the run-up of the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Moslem-terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manifest to the public in order to increase the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">The use of Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>

<seg id="380">"we went to the mosque, or did we stay safe at home?"</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not a slight decision, because it was because of America we want to leave our children: one that would control us through fear, or one where we can do our religion free."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided to the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"we went in silence with our son in the children's residence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>

<seg id="409">"before the air pact in our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of airmachines at the Frac Centre in France has built live a six metre high tower from 1 500 bricks. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting cables, high speed and acceleration reach closest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">They can also build self-loaded structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">They have learned to carry loads to deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws.</seg>
<seg id="413">"today, we want to show you some of our new projects."</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the borders of Possible in autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order to manage a system autonom, it has to know collectively, where the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this allows us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, an offsprings of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each flying machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine computations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at highest levels, for example." "start" "and". ""</seg>

<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient, much more efficient than helicopter in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most popular wingers, it can float large and great benefits at starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a flip side."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of tailor is that they react sensitively to turbulences like windarcs.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the flight device doesn't matter in which position the optimal position will be recovered, and the performance can be improved by practicing."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often represent basic abstract questions that penetrate the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for this to know the answer to one such question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand mobile parts, which gather together to violate you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots couldn't fly remote control units that had only two moving parts: a propeller and a rear skirt."</seg>
<seg id="435">We discovered that flying with only one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the monoinner, the mechanically simplest remote control unit. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no valves, hinges and cross-rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, it happens very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the tailor. to bring it to flying, I must throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it right, if all look on, is low, therefore show you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the monopoly is an exercise in genious, this machine is here, the Omnihead with its eight Propeller, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">Therefore he is equivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the utmost ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"in the room to move in all directions, no matter which direction it is rotated or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is shown in models, the rest is learned directly when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's see that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines should be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propellers of propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">These revolves around clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, somewhat wrong -- a engine or propeller falls, the electronics or a battery -- may continue to fly the machine if restricted."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate that by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration studied synthetic shear.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a wide range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">"we took standard micro-Quadcopter -- every single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and outfit them with localization technology and algorithms."</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">"hopefully, you will motivate these demonstrations to reflect new revolutionary ideas."</seg>
<seg id="463">"Broadway, a particularly secure machine, wants to hang on Broadway a flying lamp screen."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>

<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that creative, smart creature allows to form them in a spectacular way."</seg>

<seg id="471">It was a very big pop.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they didn't put their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was given into space-time-emotion and the universe exploded in gravitation waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">We arrange the events at a time.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, mainly multi-cell life was born on earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God raised us in -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"some 25 years ago, a group of particularly mucous -- Rai Weiss decided to build a giant laser detector by MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- a giant laser detector, which are caused by collizing black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">They held most of them for crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized it as a mad genius so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the Detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer - Gravitation-Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up time, the precision of Ligo could considerably increased, which improved the detection performance enormously."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore we call it Advanced Ligo now.</seg>
<seg id="484">"beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run by some smaller, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitation waves of the two colored black holes was through the ground."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector through.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my todill father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"basically, these were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that is what I had worked, is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist on MIT. he has been studied gravitational waves from black holes and their observatories like Ligo. but what are gravitation waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitation wave is a crusement in the composition of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when crossing the shaft, space and entire content will be stretched into a direction and into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">To illustrate lecturers in courses for relativity-theory often a real albery dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusty, stretching and dusty."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravity waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, every one of us was stretched and stressed by us. the stretching of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is called 20 Nulls following the comma, followed by a 1. this reason, the Ligo staff explained for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with five kilometers long laser detector, and this is already absurd, this length should be measured to less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear power. that is grotesk."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on Gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGOs, pursuing hunting according to the waves:" the technical difficulties with the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"however, physicists are invaluable and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Return to Ligo. Scott claims that Ligo be more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what that means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"clear light has a wave length, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">That's quite practical. because so you can make a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you.</seg>
<seg id="509">During killing is that different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"therefore it is very difficult, actually impossible to manufacture a picture of things, which mean to you very much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain properties like pitch, rhythm, and volume to close to the story behind."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"lobster Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We can do with them no simple pictures of objects in all.</seg>
<seg id="519">"by doing changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are measured in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so, when we convert wave pattern in sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the Gravitation could listen to us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has already been employed for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply circulate: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"turn the two body very quickly, you can hear the same cirps with an additional sound change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement, distinct in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date I never forget it -- heard Ligo the following: [surrendering sound] Jno one knows what he must hear, recognises this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes, each as fast as the rods of your shaker."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in all, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Put these forces in front of them.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">There is the lasting significance of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a completely new way to investigate the universe as it was never possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this way we can listen to the space and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in all we can -- practically or basically -- do not see.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why exploding stars in supernovae explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about the All.</seg>
<seg id="538">"but the exciting physical intages happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitation waves penetrate iron, as it would be transparent glass. the Urball: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the urine is covered by its own latitude."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitation waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly, I'm optimistic that we have never seen in all things we've never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things we can only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo took place in the first run of things we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this subject: me: the kind of stars that bring up black holes, as Ligo they are observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient and ancient times. the black holes are so called the Sauripenbone for our archaeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">Ligo enables us to view a completely different angle of view on the events in all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, as we went out of this chaos. "</seg>
<seg id="547">"AA: the challenge is now, as brave as possible."</seg>
<seg id="548">Thanks to Ligo we know how to build great detectors and lurking the cosmos of the cosmos.</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new Observatories -- a brand new generation of Observatories on Earth and All.</seg>
<seg id="550">"for what could be more beautiful, than to listen to the urine itself?"</seg>
<seg id="551">Now the time is great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year, I would say" Yes! "I was afraid of whom I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me in unpleasant situations, I forced me" Yes "to say."</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>

<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a mad thing happened: exactly what to do, I was afraid, did my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear, to keep speaking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes," my life changed. "</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" "changed me."</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain Yes that changed my life, unexpectedly. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, called all" Bibs "for unexplained reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As a waiter it would be a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my purge."</seg>
<seg id="572">She once asked her if I could play with her when I was at the jump and I said: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="573">This was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"of a new life setting in my family. from there I swear to always to play with them, once you have done me. no matter what I am doing right, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I strive very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an intriguing side effect: I was actually completely understood that the "Yes" sinages to play with my children my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am writing author. I think things look up for life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I read more productive television.</seg>
<seg id="585">I'm doing television in a large style.</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for making 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours TV. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each show features hundreds of jobs, which did not exist before."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for one month's episode can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let's say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode, every nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three shows that are simultaneously produced in production, sometimes four, 16 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series runs on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series will run in 256 regions in 256 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts which I have created ourselves, and not only produced, so still obtrusive. I must find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans about the camp fire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours TV, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you.</seg>
<seg id="601">I tell it because I know what you think if the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you that all of you who work so hard if you're now a company, a country or a classroom to take me seriously if I say of work, that you may not only understand that I'm not just around the computer when I say: I understand that there is no dream at a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"everything is a job, all work, everything reality, all blood, everything perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"if I am absorbed into the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work creates a land from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is, when I set up the troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a dream, you would like a high tone, then a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanically, exhausting and intoxicating, fun and maternal, clinically and reasonable, cruel and reasonable. and the best of it is the sum."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is so a change in me when working is well running.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a sums starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the sums listens like a busy street, I could go for ever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I tell them the sum that I speak about writing that writing was made me pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began working with television production, when I started working and work and work to create, create, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this sum, this energy. the sums!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums is action and activity. the sums is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums is music. the sums is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sum of God is the voice of God in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, you cannot strive differently than size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"feeling, not different to achieve, regardless of size, no matter what price is."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">"or perhaps, it also signifies an workflow."</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it's called Ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not for failure, and I only know that I love the sum."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will just say to you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to ask it into question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more so successful I become, the more shipments, the more the more incidentally, the more work they are, the more things I do, the more the more I write, the more expectations I have history, the more expectations it gives."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, I create the marathon, I run, the army, the army, the high sound, the sums, the sums, the sums."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I only this sums?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overrun, exaggerated, overrun."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sum stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working title.</seg>
<seg id="644">Harper tells people: "my mum will not be there but you can write my Nanny.</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Bibs, I want to go to Shonda. ""</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a titanium.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby-titanium.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when the sums heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The sums of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I don't loved my work anymore. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums didn't come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same titanium work, 15 hours-days, performed weekends, no pense, nothing delegating, a Titan sleeps not, is not on with all your heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no sums.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me silence was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a show-Titan</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the sums and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so, what do you do if that is what you do, the work you love, suddenly faded?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think:" locustl you, stupid author's. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know, you do it, you're working, one loves to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill gates, and knows how to feel the sums when the sum stopped, who is one then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I like?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart listens, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states-waitin" ask me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out, late and she says:" Mama, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="673">"and I will tell no, than two things will be aware of:"</seg>
<seg id="674">"first of all, I have to say Yes to all and secondly, she didn't called me" Bib. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">They are called anyone more "kittens."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it if I'm working Titan's and my buzz, and here everything changes my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you like playing? "</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">That is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters reject this, we laugh much and I read completely dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and my panic, in solitude and in lack of the sum, I can do nothing but to stop."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I'm silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, I create the marathon, I run the marathon, the army, the army, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, tender voices, wax cracks and the song in which it can leave, or whatever the girl in" Die Eisqueen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door is going on and an energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediately, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The sums comes back slowly.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no loudness, hardly there, it is quiet, hardly audible, but it is here."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel when I would know a magic mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">There is something we've forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the workmen, the Titanensummen, is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I say to you, who I am, if I am using me using broadcasts and television lessons, and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is no power and it is not work specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real Summen depends on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the stream that comes from the vitality.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real Summen is self-awareness and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real Summen ignores the pressure of history, which are to be experiencing tasks, expectation and pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">Real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sums is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps whispered me the wrong words, because what God told me that I am a Titan am?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"once my child wants to play with me, I will say Yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I am doing this rule, so I can free myself as workouts from any debt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is a law, I have no other choice. I don't have any other choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not well in play, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"don't play for a satin, like working."</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth is hurt,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I rather am at work as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this confession is painful, because what a person rather works than to be home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I think."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">"none of them, is none of it."</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rasen around the garden, and back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We cut soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel greater stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">Always I'm getting ready for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children tell me how to live, and the sums of the universe fulfils me."</seg>
<seg id="739">"I play and play, until I ask myself: why did we stop playing with the playing?"</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also! tell them Yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you'll keep me for naive, for a meeting."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you probably have right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"most little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, up to them that they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"there are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkaefer or biscuit replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and my Teenie-daughter speaks for 15 minutes long with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more needs not need."</seg>
<seg id="752">Everyone can get 15 minutes on a piece by yourself on a bad mood!</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the track!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile, no washing, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the kids get ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">There are 15 minutes in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-hlohare, my world. there must not be the children. it is to feel the sum to have a place for his soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with their own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">Around "Play" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Indulge in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find it out and keep it away.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I wins. friends meet, reading books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I have abandoned, when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training as I wanted to surpass more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes on a piece, why do not allow for 15 minutes to allow yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums appears to return if I'm not working.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work not works without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door open up and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown tune, it fills me and my soul. I lead me to new ideas. I use it into full moves and love my work again."</seg>
<seg id="770">I like the sums but I don't love it.</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I'm not the sums that Summen is not me... not anymore.</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">That is now my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The sums of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"it is a snavel that I'm a Titan, I've never seen a Titan, who plays the journey to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said Yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything in hand. my brain is still working. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the country, I run, the marathon, I run, the troop, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums, the sums of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more makes this unusual, beating, naked and new feeling in me. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">I am writing author. I think things I wake up for life.</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, that means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"that's the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job was supposed to be a little dream.</seg>
<seg id="792">I said "Yes" to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="793">Titanes have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do every day with human tragedies."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how to change your life from a second to the other, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgery it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other bodies, has a very low capacity to self-healing healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious violations of the central nervous system patients often have a permanent, heavy handicap."</seg>
<seg id="801">That's probably the reason why I was functional neurosurgical.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">"a doctor, who tries to improve the nerve function through various surgical actions."</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly, they have heard from one of the most well known, the" deep-brain stimulation. "it implanted a electrode deep in the brain to influence the circuits of neurons so that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's disease which suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help yourself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The history began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was an executive board and worked day and night.</seg>
<seg id="813">I often provided patients with skulls-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">You have to imagine that the brain has shifted the brain with skulls-brain traumata and the skull pressure.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save lives, one must decrease the skull pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen cerebral mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist and brain mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by this?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece, comparable to very small children, which will be taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right food, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That's what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean François abolished Jean François."</seg>
<seg id="825">That looked under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a great surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"maybe you still know of the biologic studies that stem cells are unripe, which can turn into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has tristem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niche of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to get this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal Stem Cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They divided slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like a stem cells but changed differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebrum-rindless cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the course of the foetus, they ensure the folding of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe she is taking part in the healing of brain, as we find it in higher concentrations near brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But that is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- of these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">"we stand in front of a potential cell source, enabling the brain allocation."</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove that.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate cells precisely as cultured as Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">And they then colour to mark them to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we implanted them on the basis of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we implanted these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implanted the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with monkeys."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we implanted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that they had been removed after a few weeks, they would go back home. the room is already occupied, they will not be needed there, so they will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we had an injury and implanted exactly the same cells and now they continued to get cells -- they grew up neural neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">The proof they show are these small points. these are the cells we are colored in vitro in the culture.</seg>
<seg id="863">We could not stop here.</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take animal pellets for a tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They did it very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had reached a stable skill level, we had the engine motechnology range in motorised Cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could not move their hand anymore."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen with people, they rushed spontaneously up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">Patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover themselves with the help of plastic brainmechanisms. they are recovering to a certain degree as the monkeys.</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left hand, they see the monkey, which overtook spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can bring about 40% to 50% of its initial performance from violation of injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, see when we implanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after irritation transplantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found much more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and then use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathology models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, as the human brain has the means to cure itself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can't need. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely go.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are, before you can start clinical trials on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the greatest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to pass this type of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">BG: this is understandable that the brain is very delikat etc.</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yeah, but it needs a long time, a lot of patience and a nearly professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">BG: look into the future -- you have finished research and tried to obtain permission from the start of clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future as many years it may come to the hospital and this therapy will be available.</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">Initially it depends on the approval of the clinical trial.</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to choose patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one has to reprove that it is useful before you can offer these treatment."</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is sure of course. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it.</seg>
<seg id="900">BG: thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"in the West, we are making a great mistake in the West."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy than the fragile plant that is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as an unchanging circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great descendant in Beijing have proven that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while the policy is completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is weak with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was declared to me as a finance minister in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not ascertained the austerity programmes that had been materialised in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment, I thought that there might be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my favorite friends who repeatedly said that democracy would change if they would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">At this point I would like to present an economical model for a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in together with me again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup of a mistake, we could save democracy, but that we need a true and defensic democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are brick, our future gloomy and our great, new technologies."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting conflict that currently is threatened with our host."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin summit paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the debt mountain, who accuses his long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few know his dymus.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the inherent asparagus and concert, however, which would be too anxious to wear it where it would be productive and income to produce all of the things that kind of mankind is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, in the United States, in England and in the eurozone, 3,4 trillion U.S. dollars were invested in all the prosperity of producing goods, such as industrial facilities, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion US dollars would be compared to much money till one compares it with 5.1 trillion U.S. dollars, which lay around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to rub except the stock exchanges and the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital forms the twin summit, which are not equal to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result are stagnating wages, more than one quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe, and therefore, a low overall economic demand, which may not invest in which they do not invest in which they could not invest. exactly like Ödipus Father, who would kill him, if he is able to kill him."</seg>
<seg id="925">"unintentionally, the circumstances suggest that they kill him."</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my shark with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"its extremely polluted art. all unproductive capital should be used to improve human talents and develop particularly all the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial for the rescue of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">So democracy is the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I think so. but before we proceed: what do we understand under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the form of society in which the Free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy ended too many of course --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to minate the job value of athenian democracy due to these inclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is that it was deprived of the working arms, but not only the right to freedom of expression, but rather important and crucial, which they gave them the right to political co-determination with the same voting rights in question of state powers."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not have long been kept for long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that shines very bright, it also has burned up quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the US constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on the free citizens and strengthened the working arms, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta which ultimately became a statute for ruling."</seg>
<seg id="940">"for the liberal democracy only came out when a complete separation of politics and economics was possible, and the democratic process was drafted to politics, so the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies, since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, an inexorable struggle between the two, and the economy gradually entering politics and dismastered them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why the politicians are not more so earlier?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not in a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is estimated that one can be in the government nowadays, and still not in power because the power of politics comes in the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hair with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is like a herd of predatory animals, which is so sustainable the animals, of which they are nourished, decimated, so that they were hungry at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is similar to the economy that the policy is so far-kannibalized, that it grows through the self-caused economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations increases, political goods will rise, the overall economic demand, and the general manager of the corporations are anxious to invest the cash of their businesses."</seg>
<seg id="948">"ever successful of capitalism the" demos "[the people] expels from democracy, the higher the twin summit, and the greater the waste of human labour and welfare of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if that's true, it is obvious that we have to bring back the politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "control the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea already 100 years ago and it was not very strange.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the doctrine from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be, that the working poor can only recover through a miracle, as in ancient Athens, without creating new kinds of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: creating the working arms!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it to be replaced by low cost of low automation through automation and robot.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is that long economy and politics are separate areas, the automation of the twin summit can be higher, the wastage increases, and the social conflicts deeper, as it is very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so, we need to transform the economy and reunited the areas of economy and politics, and make sure we will be more democratic, otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyperautocratie, which lets the movie" Matrix "like a documentation."</seg>
<seg id="957">"so the question is not, whether capitalism has brought forth the technical achievements, which he has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether it resembles capitalism by a dystopia, similar to the" "matrix," "or something that the company is stuck in the exploration of the universe, or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long conversations with the sense of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we may be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be like, how could it look like this" star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "-like Dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to call you shortly, some examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: ask a capital market in which you earn money while you are working and in which your capital is next to you from a workplace to the next, and the company -- no matter in which one is currently working -- is property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and revenues come from revenues and the concept of wage labour is completely outdated."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction is no distinction between those who belong to the company, but do not belong in it, but the company does not belong to which the company does not belong to which the company does not belong to capital and work, no major gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately not a receptive twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the area of global political economy, please indicate that our national currencies would have a free exchange rate in a universal, global, digital currency, which is issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all mankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"keep in mind that the world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" cosmos "-- and every government pay the sum of equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of the country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund has invested in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment is rare."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is no new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical resources to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially in the background of a unified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe you is at the same time liberally, in which they privileged individuals, and marxistic because they have buried the separation of capital and labour in the trash of history, and keynesian, global keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">Are we waking up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we drop in a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">"the answer depends on how we choose together politically."</seg>
<seg id="977">It is in our hands and we do it better democratic.</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You give yourself a libertarian Marxisten in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I just said is relevant then Marx is relevant.</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for reunification of politics and economy... Do we do not do that, the technological development will generate a massive decline in total economic demand which Larry Summers referred to as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"thanks to the transmission of this crisis of a part of Earth on the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilise our democracies, but also the countries whose interest in liberally democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is accurate, Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I'm totally wirr."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: indeed, and now we are too."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a sort of philosophical statement -- YV: actually it was Einstein, who said that. BG: in your lecture you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner the speakers, you have very clearly said what you keep from the point of view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a big dimension of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the registration of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited the democracy in politics during the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratically-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a certain extent, if I may say that such provocative, China resembles China today to the 19th century England."</seg>
<seg id="995">"-- Do you remember -- we tend to associate liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, as John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed in China, resembles very the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to hand in China, to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I'm sure that many listeners are curious to experience your experience as the finance minister of Greece at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from personal view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, that a massive reduction line through the eurozone began to say, and continuing to pass through the Eurozone, and continues to withstand the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek demonstration -- by the way, the first proposal was to reveal this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"to make it correct. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continues to deny the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you tried to obtain a economic system that is not able to get lifelong through political will and autharianism, it may be put out a while, but if the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what will you see ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the euro zone has no future if we do not change its structure.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you have any mistakes in your time as finance minister?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in a so-called situation, claims that he did not have any mistakes, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake had to be submitted to the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on pages of the Bankors to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They only wanted to bring our government just because they did not want to deal with the subjectives who ran through the Eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They didn't want to admit that they carried out a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost a third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the Troika, who has imposed this policy, revealed:" that was a colossaler error. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all that, and despite the aggressive mood of the talks, you seem to be quite a pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone, opposite someone who lives and love Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the euro area did not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they did not survive, the released flying forces will be romonastic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not have disastrous consequences for Europe alone, but for the whole world economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"if we allow ourselves to strike the way of a post-modern 1930, after that it seems to me, it will be also unbearable for the future of Europeans and non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope you're going wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you very much that you were at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thank you.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard the most yet, although it is probably responsible for 22-moderate minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is the senior employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slender, has an icon and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for making the shows and content to produce the Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are already so many TV series that Roy can't choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that turn right on this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the evaluation distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the evaluation goes from 1 to 10, and the height shows how many shows this evaluation are received."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then one has a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bath, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that you're addicted, where, after one looked after a season, your brain asks:" where is there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going to do at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price does not worry about the left side of the curve because I don't need special intelligence to undertake "Toddlers and tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes himself more thoughts about the middle expression, the average TV -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they don't inspire them."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he really is on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon is so something that's why Roy Price doesn't want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs great success, so he holds a contest."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and shows them online where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if there is Amazon for free things, you can get involved, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">"millions of viewers are looking at these episodes, too."</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">Roy and his team is watched by Roy and his team.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you turn out what parts you skips or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">"collect millions of data to decide with these data, which show they should produce."</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process this and from this results the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom about four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that no many can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve 7.4 is and Alpha House lands with 7,5 -- therefore something on average, but not just what Roy and his team worked out."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time at another company, another manager has plazed a top show by data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, manager for program design of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking for this a super-show and he uses data, but he does it something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of a competition, he and his team have looked at the existing data on the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give the shows, their course, what shows it etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use these data to find out these little details about the viewers: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had gathered all the parts together they entered a car and decided not to make a Sitcom about four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "receives a 9,1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what is happening here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"two very competent, data experienced companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data, and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">Why is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, then you should make a good choice."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">Optimized with a very powerful computer.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the Mindeste, what one can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work so it is something terrifying because we are living in a time, in which we have more and more statistics to meet serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody ever comes into contact with this software. come in touch, you're in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if a man is in prison in the US and asking for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a release is done or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just as at Amazon and Netflix. but rather than decide whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person is good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate TV, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that these data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">It does not always produce the best results. it is not aware that a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of the most experienced companies are also false.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can be foreseen through data analysis of flu, the limlimmen, -- through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news station. the success gipfelted in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked fine, year around year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it was simply not working, this was once again a sensation, including the withdrawal of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these errors, data are in decisions of life a -- in the workplace, with legal reasons, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather ensure that data are helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-supported genetics -- an area where some very smart people can use unimaginable many data to make serious decisions as the decision for a cancer therapy</seg>
<seg id="1109">"or the development of a drug. over the years, I recognized some samples using the difference between successful decisions based on data and non-successful decisions. this pattern should be disseminated."</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have a complex problem, you do need two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"once you disassemble this problem in its components, so you can analyse the items; as a second, put the single parts together to hold a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help relieve a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">"they are not suitable to re-establish the parts, and then come to a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool and we all have it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to put together again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to hold a good decision -- especially if it's the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think, Netflix was so successful because they have used data and understanding where they belong also in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to understand their audience better what they could not have been capable of. but the decision, how to make all these parts, set up again and see a show like" House of Cards "," that was not in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show - what meant they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose" Alpha House "as show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "they tell us the data.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data are helpful for better choices, but I think things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and that is not forgotten, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Thanks to you...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before sending data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It's also called "Magic 8 Ball". it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or No question you will only shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- exactly here in this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I'll get it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have listened to the ball in the night."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace them by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the foundation.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"so, perhaps the ball will be wiser and wiser and wiser. ultimately it is in us to meet decisions if we want to reach something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as a encouraging news, that despite the great amount of data still paid to make decisions, an expert in what you do, and risks go."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"by the end, it is not the data, but the risks where you can land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks beautiful.</seg>
