&quot; Munich , 1856 : four cards that change your eyes to the city &quot;
an Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt where teenagers should face up today .
&quot; a chapel , where it is dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small vin@@ ed@@ ress@@ ers cover the ru@@ sty reason of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days .
it is annoying if the maps are not currently running .
everyone knows that already was exciting because the car Nav@@ i took place in a green meadow instead of a circum@@ vent .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atl@@ ases , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as in Bavaria of the State Government , are all other than current - yet very reve@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; especially if you compare it with current online cards . &quot;
&quot; then the cities and communities in the Munich Merk@@ ur Region has changed since the 19th century , as far as cities and communities . &quot;
the digital Bayern Atlas is a fli@@ ck@@ eting carpet that is not the same as such .
&quot; the great over@@ seen map were incorporated in towns and municipalities in more detailed maps , so called Ur@@ positioning blades . &quot;
&quot; these arose according to the Bavarian survey@@ ance Administration , between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey@@ ing of Bay@@ erns . &quot;
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; in the spring of 1800 , the French army leaders occupied Bavaria during the Second coalition war with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic survey of Bay@@ erns in order - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops were finally deduc@@ ted with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville , February 9 , 1801 , the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ card . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max . Joseph drove the project further ahead , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian survey@@ ing Administration . &quot;
the Ur@@ positi@@ onal sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and is like all others on the site of the Bavarian State Library .
&quot; compared to Early / Today , the regional capital is the most impressive . &quot;
&quot; the city has expanded in all directions , and has grown together . &quot;
&quot; an example of this is sub@@ str@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the Map of 1856 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling has been published 21 years after creating the map , so 1877 , as the Munich &apos;s district . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses were concentrated in 1856 by today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ ans@@ er in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , one sees nothing as fields - at first sight : when inside zo@@ oming appears a small @-@ piece card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; urine &quot; derived from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
small plots there are no farmers anymore - but small vin@@ ed@@ ress@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green surface is characterized by the north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ es@@ ien@@ wi@@ ese , dating back to 1810 , has actually been a meadow in the 19th century , and no concrete structure in the 19th century . &quot;
on the other side of Is@@ ar the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine .
&quot; in the jungle leaf@@ let one reads in the field of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , just the street names &quot; &quot; Guest eig &quot; &quot; or from the &quot; &quot; View &quot; &quot; on the air &quot; &quot; but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ field road , people once locked there with gu@@ ardi@@ ans . &quot;
there was in 1858 / 59 the Munich District @-@ Ir@@ ene Institution &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von G@@ ud@@ den led the establishment - this psychiat@@ rist who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has under@@ stated the personnel , violence against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; said Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who has engaged for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; initially there was space for 280 patients , and it was extended to 500 places later . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the county Institution in Hair 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ ikum Munich @-@ Ost is one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ rist@@ les . &quot;
&quot; on the area of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt , young people meet in the Munich Sal@@ es@@ an@@ um . &quot;
&quot; in 1920 , the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and went into a youth centre . &quot;
&quot; located west is the football field of TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential homes from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built in architectural based on the origin of the Ir@@ ene Institute , which was destroyed during the Second World War . &quot;
the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 1856 as a &quot; main place &quot; and the Kauf@@ ing@@ erst@@ raße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger alley . &quot;
a decisive change brought to the Second World War as well in the heart of the mouth .
&quot; in December 1944 , the bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre . &quot;
a big one remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the British Institute , small business houses and a grave chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days are working on and on April 5 , 2017 , for the second S @-@ Bahn station . &quot;
&quot; with the Sli@@ ber@@ eg@@ ler , the old Munich @-@ Card can be compared to the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
Civil Rights Corporate Rights Publ@@ ished for Missouri
&quot; the National Association for the promotion of farms has issued a warning for color people , which are travelling to Missouri because of the discri@@ min@@ ating politics and rac@@ ist attacks of the State of Missouri . &quot;
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory in the State of Missouri , which aims to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American trav@@ ellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ aner , as a number of frag@@ ile , racial @-@ based events occur throughout the state and notice here , &quot; says it in the statement of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted legislation of Missouri , which makes it harder to gain discrimination against min@@ ating discrimination , as well as the prosecution of the state that di@@ spro@@ ve the group to publish the trip , the NA@@ AC@@ P said . &quot;
&quot; they have injuries of citizenship rights , which happen to people . &quot;
&quot; they will be stopped due to its skin color , they are crushed or killed , &quot; said the President of the Missouri NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has exhibited for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incid@@ ents such as rac@@ ist fights for black students at the University of Missouri and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had suffered no more fuel during the journey through the State of Missouri , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri @-@ General Office of Missouri , which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees learn about what could happen in Missouri , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people must be willing to bring whether it should bring Kau@@ tex , or the relatives that they are travelling through the state . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Missouri was reported to break out in the year 2015 , following the latest figures from the Hass@@ ver@@ bre@@ eders @-@ report of the FBI , which stages the state in terms of number of injuries on the 16th place of the country . &quot;
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to su@@ e a company because of residential or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) of the travel war@@ nings for Texas and Arizona had adopted after the States immigration laws have committed to rep@@ utable people because of violations of the AC@@ L@@ U to further rein@@ forcement . &quot;
&quot; travel war@@ nings will usually be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence is elementary
the fishing tra@@ vers@@ ation project is a success project and will continue in the next year .
the CDU Bundestag member of Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac have obtained a picture on the spot .
&quot; member of the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ b@@ acher &apos;s CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two M@@ EPs . &quot;
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann first granted insights into its operations , in which it houses 55 hectares of forest and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is for him the alternative market @-@ market for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
only regional on the table of the holiday bars will come exclusively region@@ ally .
&quot; as he is also the BL@@ HV @-@ Chairman of Fis@@ bach , he described the electric fence as a &quot; elementary project . &quot; &quot;
I can &apos;t profit on this type of steep areas .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , things have to be processed using the engine sense . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and the top@@ ography , &quot; Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann emphas@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the el@@ eventh operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fer@@ ti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he does not run bio operation . &quot;
Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; the Commun@@ e has recognized the meaning of the electric fence and is happy with the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers had to be supported . &quot;
&quot; one hope , that the collecting capacity of the areas could still be pulled out for a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they bring forth their operation , &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often concerned because of promoting the criticism
&quot; over the electric fence , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; the closure area is thus 40 hectares , which can not be opened up to at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 Euro , half was funded by leaders , a quarter of the municipality of fishing bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of electric fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of f@@ ences , &quot; said Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
K@@ ord@@ ula Kov@@ ac stressed : &quot; you do not make a really good job , without farmers and land . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter White , too : &quot; best foods are produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Partnership ( l@@ p@@ r ) Baden @-@ Württemberg allows state support of Wei@@ de@@ zä@@ unen .
the aim is to maintain the Black Forest .
pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is the presence of one of the l@@ p@@ r signed funding .
&quot; moreover , the in@@ jected area may not be bad ( Hang@@ ing over 35 per cent ) and must be threatened by the en@@ forcement . &quot;
&quot; for the fishing b@@ acher electric fence in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the closure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the estimated costs are more than 112 000 Euro . &quot;
is nothing sacred anymore ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump now takes the Statue of Liberty
&quot; the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is , if they start to att@@ acking the statues . &quot;
&quot; the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore , the car@@ ding set Saddam Hussein &apos;s fall on the Fir@@ dos Square in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 . &quot;
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic act with Jim A@@ co@@ sta of CNN about the proposals of the President to the dra@@ stic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to be fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ers could have vo@@ iced when he had done it .
&quot; but he touched their meaning , and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument was added . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compl@@ ain , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing over history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom which en@@ light@@ ens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is objec@@ tively correct , but as it form@@ ulated himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is concerned about the contemporary words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state will not only invite any old immigrants , but the trouble of the poor : &quot; your tr@@ ash , your poor , / your th@@ ron@@ ged masses , that lon@@ gs to breathe freely , and the ends of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time in which the &quot; el@@ ight tr@@ ash &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ um@@ ps USA .
this conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion : it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America .
Lazarus - and her friends who did so to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they did a high political action .
&quot; the sculpture should show the connections between French and American rep@@ ublic@@ ans , by portra@@ ying the feminine em@@ bo@@ diment of freedom in a worn classic image . &quot;
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem is the female figure no longer abstract - it has received a voice .
and they themselves have a very different name : mother of Ex@@ il@@ ant .
the connection of the di@@ lem@@ ma with the picture is a brilliant feminine cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vism .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this long before the right wing . &quot;
&quot; the big cry of Rush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a type of Johannes des Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argu@@ ed in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was able to charge it , but rather an early Ne@@ ok@@ on@@ ese that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes forward . &quot;
it should carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
tor@@ ch does not want to shine the way into the United States .
quite unusual Lim@@ bau@@ gh is found here on something .
the meaning of the statue is quite and a question of the perception of perception .
&quot; the great fantastic action of Lazarus existed in her to see them as they were seen by the exhau@@ st@@ ive , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible vo@@ y@@ ages on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense to see the world from the perspective of people , seeking refuge and chance to improve their lives . &quot;
&quot; their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome , which they must hear . &quot;
&quot; and this is , of course , not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognise . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch shall not shine the way , but hatred , which is the only source of power . &quot;
world Championship 2017 : Neil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the United Kingdom
E@@ ili@@ dh Doyle remembers a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the Athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent of the world championship &quot; has a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot;
black believes that &quot; in Scotland is something special &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it .
&quot; we welcome it , and we are trying to understand , and we will continue to find out until we &apos;ll find it , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I &apos;m talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it &apos;s something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athl@@ ete think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the road corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athl@@ ete are medals @-@ candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ p@@ chart - which will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah during the 5.000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ dh Doyle of the crew was elected as a team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ dh is quite modest .
&quot; their cap@@ tains address was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or where they always live or exercise , went out of the room and felt very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , the E@@ ili@@ dh completely naturally brought , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth Silver medal winner , which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 shots in the British team are . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the mid @-@ range Mu@@ ir leads to this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to observe the victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anniversary Games . &quot;
Doyle remembers her first world cup as the only other Scot@@ sman to the team Lee Mc@@ Conn@@ ell .
&quot; the Mannheim Captain tells us that she is enorm@@ ously proud of the fact that many of her comp@@ atri@@ ots not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special so special team captain will be in it , that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour to know that my team @-@ mates have voted for me and chose me , making it something special for me , &quot; &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we came .
and they are here as an established athl@@ ete who want to climb to Po@@ sts .
what my speech happened as captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
&quot; so , it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiast@@ adion . &quot;
&quot; I get a second chance to go there and compete , and it &apos;s just like a great atmosphere there . &quot;
block from critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you don &apos;t wear the heating by voters
the father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from interior policy up to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he ch@@ imp@@ lied with the cr@@ iti@@ que , certainly . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and dum@@ b , as the sheep are led to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry H@@ og@@ an , who must work on it , to be more like Washington . &quot;
H@@ og@@ ans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union mour@@ ned him this week at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the staff of the governor dismissed the law@@ suit as fri@@ vol@@ a , and the online commentary was full of an inter@@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it &apos;s especially important when it is a type like H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state , which is amaz@@ ingly popular . &quot;
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
H@@ og@@ an is not a re@@ ac@@ tionary bit@@ head .
he showed a fixed hand in the guidance of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
&quot; he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ bac@@ le his ha@@ ired head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block of persons appearing on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that will be paid as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - un@@ necessarily , and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post defended H@@ og@@ ans Speaker Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the acts of the Governor , argu@@ ed that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s too easy to use the image of tro@@ t or sp@@ ies , or h@@ ass@@ ump@@ ten people , which vibr@@ ate online . &quot;
the post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by H@@ og@@ an .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no tro@@ ll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respec@@ t@@ ful , thou@@ ght@@ ful and un@@ prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest cited the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to H@@ og@@ an Catholic faith .
&quot; attor@@ ney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not satisfied , but she asked me to break out . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m cour@@ te@@ ous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hass@@ ver@@ ts and other current news , &quot; wrote the message program &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people in the same topic is , then they are regarded as a so @-@ called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Governor called &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; , &quot; others would probably call &quot; inter@@ c@@ ession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic , or delete a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is much cleaner than in past time , when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conduc@@ tiv@@ ations and bring them to silence , and to silence protest@@ ers . &quot;
but precisely this is done digit@@ ally .
H@@ og@@ an is not the first public officials to crit@@ ici@@ ze Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was reported last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ visors of Lou@@ dou@@ n County , the First Am@@ end@@ ment , according to U.S. District Judge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , as they named a voters from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Governor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for its use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
that should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of the affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiply between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous envel@@ opes struck his lead . &quot;
and even at that time Washington had anonymous tro@@ ll@@ s .
&quot; people who used p@@ seud@@ ony@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ ti@@ us , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that settle Washington decisions . &quot;
&quot; pet@@ itions that crit@@ ici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Britain , overwhel@@ med his ministry , according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t put it into silence .
freedom of expression and dis@@ courses belong to the foundation of our nation .
&quot; and true leadership means , to accept that . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club , &quot;
&quot; former European Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lor@@ hi@@ an hosted the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who lost links to the final year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links until the final year before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is with the new venue and acts as tournament amb@@ ass@@ adors in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance Club was built , and we see how he reaches his praise with this event , &quot; &quot; Raff@@ er@@ ty said . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry made a great job as he laid this place .
he is a jeal@@ ous of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great show@@ case for this course . &quot;
&quot; Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales are looking forward to def@@ ending a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career both at the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I won &apos;t defend the Extre@@ mad@@ ura Open , since it was taken out in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos;s a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon , to win last year here . &quot;
&quot; it was a really special time , and one that we will always appreciate . &quot;
&quot; Gary OR@@ R , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year , returns to the home soil . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said OR@@ R , the man out of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
&quot; I &apos;m glad about it , as far as we went . &quot;
&quot; with the trio in the field , the former Masters champion Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark McN@@ ulty . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; the entrance fee is free of charge , the parking fee is £ 5 a car with a occup@@ ants and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by Passi@@ v@@ smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , less people died due to liabilities of lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; at this result , scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) are in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to liabilities , &quot; said study leader Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he went up an own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases because of passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new investigation is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections are considered very complex
&quot; construction work in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; lie in time , &quot; says the director of the court Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the household connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , since the underground is much appreciated , which is not indicated in the plans . &quot;
&quot; the traffic , which has always hin@@ dered the construction work , represents a great problem for the construction of St@@ ump@@ p company . &quot;
&quot; the ignor@@ ance of drivers in front of red lights and re@@ side shi@@ vers is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road was blocked and only the scheduled buses were allowed to drive .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z was occupied by the St@@ ump@@ p company since weeks with the work on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; fortunately we were provided by our friend Fritz Matt with co@@ ined mineral water , &quot; says Marvin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indonesian Gold@@ land
&quot; if Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i cooked the dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ations in the un@@ quiet Indonesian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife is usually den@@ oted a sweet potato - locally called &quot; Not@@ a &quot; - directly into the chim@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the ch@@ illed no@@ bility is taken with eag@@ erly , un@@ washed hands and swallowed up . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay floor - she has no furniture , where she performs her daily work , such as clothes with cloudy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be too dangerous to work dangerous : most of the vill@@ agers are unemployed , and many drink it , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; no one is w@@ alled after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare view into the daily life of the Hochland von Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony , which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , than just 1,0@@ 26 elders to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that touched for independence against the Dutch rule , turned back rapidly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which includes control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal ob@@ servers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the provinces was officially divided into Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , where the independent part of Pap@@ ua New Guinea contained the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as isolated as it is desert . the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants is composed of wooden houses surrounded by bam@@ boo trees , and from corrugated walls which were converted by rust in various yel@@ low@@ ly brown tones . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indones@@ ians have made their journey here , so@@ fter than journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans named a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points on their vibrant , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright skir@@ t . &quot;
&quot; earlier , we only had leaves to our body . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is Indonesia &apos;s poorest province where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality rates in Asia have .
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Fre@@ ep@@ ort Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high @-@ land provincial in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Fre@@ ep@@ ort was min@@ ed in the value of 3.1 billion US dollars and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Pap@@ ua has a total of 78 billion US dollars in the value of a valued € 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; however , these riches are a source of affliction for the Pap@@ ua , which make sure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preser@@ ves a stri@@ ving presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation from 2005 in the New York Times reported that Fre@@ ep@@ ort paid local army officers and units between 1998 and 2004 , among them up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ anian amounts after larger autonomy thre@@ aten the gold g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to the activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped and imprisoned since 1969 by the Indonesian military . &quot;
&quot; massacre in Pap@@ u@@ as stem land in the 1970 @-@ 1990s , according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission for genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we Bec@@ ome Everything &quot; it says in a report by the Arch@@ di@@ oc@@ ese Brisbane from 2016 , in which reports about the figures of the previous year are , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric covers are especially popular after another report - and the brutal precipitation of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week happened , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researchers for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
screws have reinforced because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a flow of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demo@@ graphic development changes , as the Muslim economy will emerge from the popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sumatra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ p Cant@@ ines , fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , served a mixed vegetables with pean@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting for here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Pap@@ ua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ native that moved to work in the province of Jay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Pap@@ ua - the M@@ om @-@ Mama , the women &#93; from Pap@@ ua - their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indonesian President of Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , also known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and legal injuries in Pap@@ ua during his election campaign in 2014 . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presi@@ dential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the loc@@ als are che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the expect@@ ation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice becomes re@@ produced , &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols before a camp fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two indones@@ ian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took a violation of her tone , and later joined by four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , pursued , and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers hum@@ bled in the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so difficult that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things marked the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered at a football field before the local police station and the military command to demand justice . &quot;
&quot; they carried the arter@@ ial hunting ar@@ ches and led the Wa@@ ita @-@ Dance - in the circle continuously , and a bird cat@@ er@@ pillar - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago trunk . &quot;
some protest@@ ers started to to@@ w stones on police and military post .
&quot; when the atmosphere was heated up , the soldiers sent a command to an internal radio : &quot; if the masses have had more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; it says in an official document of TIM@@ E , which was not released by local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the imp@@ ending danger and called for peace and urged the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly burst into my left hand wr@@ ist , &quot; &quot; said TIM@@ E on the porch of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame knows still not , who is fired , but says that the ball from the ranks assembled here were gathered . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was taken three times , so his cousin , the witness of the shooting was . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was it , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who is named as many Indonesian only , the TIM@@ E in a dark mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him .
&quot; the Chief Inspec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said rep@@ orters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure their station only &quot; because they will be attacked . &quot;
&quot; we have to defend ourselves when people threatening to kill us , &quot; &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner P@@ ud@@ jo Su@@ li@@ sti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many wounded . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks the Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in Jay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympath@@ ies for the families of the victims and s@@ ware , the historical abuse of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately to be solved , so it won &apos;t happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Security Minister Wir@@ anto said that he was a extra@@ judicial mechanism for sett@@ ling historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the talking began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be run through , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then he made a withdrawal when he spoke to Jak@@ arta in Jak@@ arta on 5 June and said , he did not have plans to set up a complaint in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is legally established , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua , said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses were already settled in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
families of Pan@@ i@@ ai victims participated in such claims with Gri@@ mm@@ ed unbelie@@ vers .
&quot; I interviewed in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired .
he says that he still lives in fear .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid to be arrested by the military , I fear that they are shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us repeated the view that people have fear in Pan@@ i@@ ai &apos;s fear of discussing the incident .
&quot; he says he was beaten by the military , after helping to bury four of the victims . &quot;
&quot; after I buried the bodies , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the shooting shops have not stopped .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indonesian police fired on the vill@@ agers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a con@@ frontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma , who refused to bring a un@@ conscious man to the hospital , a person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w who was drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
regular vill@@ agers prot@@ ested to the company &apos;s site .
the police told that the vill@@ agers threw stones on officers who re@@ acted out by fir@@ ing warning shots .
but natives say that the mobile brig@@ ade ( Indonesian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot at the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ g@@ u Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness , as the last here was quickly delivered was so the TIM@@ E . &quot;
&quot; I have hidden me two days in my house . &quot;
the D@@ ei@@ y@@ ai Parliament called on to drag the officers to the account@@ ability and withdraw the mobile Brigade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a sol@@ vent for the Indonesian government .
&quot; lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members of Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dani and Dam@@ al who live in the green hig@@ hlands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; &quot; Pap@@ ua movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Pap@@ ua by putting out spor@@ adic attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indonesian troops . &quot;
some of the Top @-@ O@@ PM leaders are from Pan@@ i@@ ai including T@@ adi@@ us Yog@@ i and Daniel Yu@@ den Kog@@ o@@ ya .
&quot; in the past few years , thousands of people were arrested in Pan@@ i@@ ai and was arbitr@@ arily detained in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing of national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some people never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a tragic , forgotten place . &quot;
poverty strengthens the dis@@ content .
&quot; the little rice , sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for loc@@ als . &quot;
bread is just as range .
people find everything they eat : especially Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , each able to process four or five fields of sweet potatoes . &quot;
&quot; keep the bulk of harvest@@ ing for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market . &quot;
ten pieces of not@@ a were only 10,000 Indonesian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 C@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; during the period , economic ine@@ qualities have grown between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new flight routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which are in the region , are generally referred to the better trained and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua have rare the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in keeping in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the St@@ em Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation holds the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on international media must be ban@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Bas@@ ille Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although the rare permission was given to movies . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report of Indonesia &apos;s un@@ quiet eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and Western pap@@ ua : visa @-@ ref@@ us@@ al and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
a lack of press control means that the international pressure remains largely limited to the Indonesian government to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific countries called T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ Islands and the Is@@ les Islands - the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Pap@@ ua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ j@@ ath@@ ir pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights ab@@ uses . &quot;
&quot; people want to know , that more foreign governments are aware of this . &quot;
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , visiting the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador , K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ ap@@ ura broke their silence and urged him &quot; &quot; We want freedom &quot; , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the session , but anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia to meet another presidential election in 2019 , but the Pap@@ ua say that they probably don &apos;t want to tune again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good int@@ entions , but he is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai Sch@@ üssen , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the Chairman of the St@@ em Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it is under the permanent threat of a common military , located in arm@@ aments and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Pap@@ ua , consider her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as an &quot; guilt , &quot; which he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in spite of threats and un@@ ting families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ sh@@ utter victims of the last symbolic act of the p@@ ite , the dead bodies of a victim was buried in a place opposite the police and military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they might never get justice , but at least they don &apos;t forget the persons responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ ob@@ us with my head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai to the second time
&quot; a fire was found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai to flee its passage and forced hundreds of inhabitants , from the 337 meters high , 79 @-@ story buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps up in just two years , which is accid@@ entally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ch tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we were standing by fire al@@ arms , scre@@ aming the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor to the bottom , &quot; &quot; told a resident that George ang@@ ab , Reuters . &quot;
Dub@@ ais civil protection authorities said that units of fire fighting against 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hrs GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building cooled .
&quot; the government said , she has been working on providing accommodation for the affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used on safety of materials , which are used in outdoor areas of buildings around the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 resulted in the most part of the damages caused by the covering , the outer cover for decoration or isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police , she said that the system of plates to insulation and covering at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June was to the rapid spread of a fire in June of which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Federation ( IT@@ F ) was passed by his major Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , this sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup single , was only able to play on two sets of winning , Hau@@ ch@@ thin not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the very long , often very long , but also very estimated five @-@ set classic remains the traditional compet@@ itor so well . &quot;
&quot; therefore 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member countries voted to reform the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty , therefore just barely missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of this iconic and historical competition , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work to improve the competition .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal has come before the final on a neutral place . &quot;
new from 2018 are compar@@ atively smaller details : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host @-@ right next year in the subsequent turn .
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in training places etc . , and players will have to complete less official media dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 American trav@@ ellers , forbidden objects in the plane , finds out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey carried out by air passengers showed that more than 20 percent consci@@ ously , or un@@ consci@@ ously prohibited items to include the control points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration pass by at least 6 percent , who entered the plane while accid@@ entally banned knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said they were delayed , that they had been wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ un@@ ition or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out more than 1,000 people - which was carried out by a Jet @-@ Char@@ ter@@ service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger trav@@ ellers should avoid the rules . &quot;
&quot; of the respondents agreed that they are kno@@ w@@ ingly tried to fly with something that was banned by T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent of mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , were members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that have been deliberately to@@ wed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 per cent said to have carried out objects using security control , while 2.2 percent of female surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents have confirmed that they were deliberately banned drugs to the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked trav@@ ellers on all the country to find out how many accid@@ entally sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware would have brought to sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware by the airport security , and how many things they had done . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people , who were most likely sm@@ ug@@ g@@ ware - t@@ ingly or un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly - carry out security , those who were most frequently flying . &quot;
&quot; the company , however , points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
&quot; people often are uncertain , which liquids may take them away , or how much of it . &quot;
&quot; so , it is no surprise that the biggest amount of conf@@ is@@ cated items banned from T@@ SA . &quot;
&quot; for a time , people thought that T@@ SA could check books as sm@@ ug@@ gel@@ ware . &quot;
liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order
electric thou@@ sand@@ s@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k can enjoy the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tesla &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
so far he has under@@ gone that part of the customer has already withdrawn their un@@ binding reservation .
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures on sales growth and even more gigantic steel targets , Tesla boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has revealed the first time to betra@@ y a less gl@@ itter@@ ing number : the cancell@@ ations made at the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k had applied frequently with the more than 500,000 common orders for the new car , whose delivery just starts . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k dreamed : of the total 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders have been re@@ tra@@ cted back to 6@@ 3.000 . &quot;
critics always noted that there is only in@@ binding reservations .
&quot; if the cancellation fee is € 1000 Tesla , the US $ 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in Britain 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation deposits &quot; completely . &quot;
&quot; at present , 45@@ ,000 of such un@@ binding reservations can be found , admitted Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; so that the cancellation of so far around 12 percent of all orders could be a problem , however , the Tesla boss does not believe . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth target is not on demand , but on the production site . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , Tesla supplied 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 , all models will be combined - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , there are currently up to 1800 reservations . &quot;
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; Model 3 &quot; , at the earliest in the second half of 2018 will be expected to be delivered at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla creates it , its brand new , never yet in practice tested production lines with maximum loading capacity . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger del@@ ays , then the in@@ line of reservations may be made for Tesla . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot hin@@ der their satisfied customers , in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; EPA boss P@@ ru@@ itt , due to reducing the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a rules on reducing emissions &quot;
&quot; one day after he had been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , took its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g caused by air pollut@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change , when his agency turned to the needs of state environmental authorities to re@@ acts faster than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit that had been raised against his prior place in a German Federal Court .
&quot; it is about a deadline , which ran on 1 October for states to keep the standards from 2015 to ground @-@ in o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would not hesitate to study in order to study the plan in order to study the plan , to avoid the plan in local decisions or to hin@@ der economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s Prosecutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , was a long time a reliable opponent of rig@@ orous environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since his arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed to block rules or delay the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the return of sudden change from Wednesday is the latest legal set@@ back for the regular roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month a Federal Court of Appeals in Washington has decided that the EPA @-@ administrator had exceeded his authority , when he tried to under@@ take the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reducing meth@@ an@@ le@@ cks to delay . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al for o@@ zone standards simply simply proposed the read@@ iness of EPA to cooperation with the states through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under earlier administr@@ ations , the EPA often has kept the dead@@ lines for the implementation and then maintained , and in an agreement the date for carrying out , &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who compl@@ ained the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in a regulation of jurisdiction , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that exist , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the statement of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt asked some of his &quot; powers to delay and all other legal rights to authority . &quot; to ensure that the regulations are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive new version of the o@@ zone rules .
&quot; last month &apos;s per@@ mitting bill , the implementation of the 2015 rules should delay by at least eight years . &quot;

&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the Coalition for the EPA in this week , said the Group intend to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6,7 million New Yorker and the more than 115 million Americans that are directly descended from the smo@@ g , &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;

tur@@ ret celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery @-@ area in Tum@@ our will be invited to a ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday July 16 , 16 : 30 . &quot;
whether its id@@ yl@@ lic location and beautiful views of the village is the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant a popular place to stay .
the visitors of the sixth charity ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted from this powerful place .
salvation and preser@@ vation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and sponsors of tum@@ ors to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ izes : &quot; it is a unique d@@ ör@@ fer small od@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ elle was first mentioned for the first time in the Württem@@ bür@@ g@@ ical Ur@@ g@@ book : count Hermann by Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church &quot; &quot; Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording mentioned on the Tum@@ linger mountain apart from the parish church besides the former parish church , a magnificent farm belonged to which the church or the patron was not vice versa . &quot;
so there were people living there too .
&quot; as from the description of the Upper Freu@@ den@@ stadt of 1858 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which is still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; Mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 under@@ mining these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ats@@ recht emerged from the early medieval school law .
&quot; one Lord , who built a church built and occupied with a priest , remained the owner of this church and was able to inherit this property . &quot;
&quot; thus , it was the right to use a priest or to the bishop a new priest . &quot;
three alt@@ ars were in the church and two bells on the tower .
the Gre@@ atest of the two zer@@ bar@@ st at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created glo@@ cke was first performed in 16@@ 92 , but had to be submitted later to the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
in the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window s@@ lows were st@@ oned and the bells were stolen .
the roof was un@@ dense .
&quot; in 1796 , French troops were en@@ camp@@ ed near the church . &quot;
&quot; they broke out the pul@@ pit and ch@@ urch@@ yard , and used them as a fire@@ wood . &quot;
remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .
&quot; until 1869 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius Cem@@ etery served as the last resting place for the dead of listening . &quot;
in 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was broken .
only the church tower was standing .
&quot; in the New Year of the year 1834 , a storm ra@@ ced a storm , and the half r@@ ushed . &quot;
&quot; to prevent a mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken . &quot;
only the existing Tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g today remained as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
today Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em of the &quot; Schaff@@ ged pension@@ ers &quot; is a successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn .
&quot; as organizers invite the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ors on Sunday , 16th July , for sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery in the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Kepler Gym@@ as@@ asi@@ ums Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with the word contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matt@@ eis .
the town of Hartmut Rom@@ ann speaks the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 pm .
admission is from 15.@@ 30 o &apos;clock .
&quot; to the end of the Ser@@ en@@ ade , a trunk in front of the cemetery takes place . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers are viewing the fantastic views . &quot;
the ser@@ en@@ ade takes place just for dry weather .
&quot; the organizers aim to support many supporters of the receipt of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and hearing s@@ wis@@ s . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of tum@@ ors feel particularly committed to home@@ use such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini .
organisation wants to test permission from wind dr@@ ones
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim takes no legal condition for the construction , and thus has turned into the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ ars &quot; has been invited by Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argu@@ ed that at the time of the permit on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only exists on the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal a wind power concentration zone exists . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy systems are generally possible , but at the same time , the concentration zone achieves a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
different zones are to prevent a &quot; spar@@ ity &quot; landscape .
&quot; as a few days earlier , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - but they had not been approved by the district government in Düsseldorf , because of a form missing . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning conditions , the approval of the appro@@ vals is un@@ lawful and therefore declined , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ kens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of things : the city council has decided again before the summer break , once again the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette ; an approval from the district government is still standing . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ kens : &quot; this is the subject of approval for the construction of wind energy systems planning to be legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the sum@@ p@@ ation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been entered for a week in the circle of Vier@@ sen , &quot; declared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; the circle takes them to the occasion , to test the matter again . &quot;
&quot; however , they do not mean that the procedure is stopped . &quot;
&quot; with a look at ongoing trial during the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle did not want to express itself in terms of the reas@@ oning of the association &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette the construction of four each 200 metres high wind turbines . &quot;
&quot; already last year , the company , which is involved in the city of Vier@@ sen , has been involved with the owners of about 65 hectares of land @-@ off @-@ ground . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind energy systems , electricity needs to be covered by around 11 400 households , equivalent to around one @-@ fifth of all four households &apos;s electricity needs . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; in the past summer , there were green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Wind@@ park Lin@@ nich at Aachen as well as a participation in a wind energy plant in the Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg district in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor travels together : woman dies in horri@@ fying accident
one terrible traffic accident falls on Friday morning at 10 o &apos;clock on the L 333 between low @-@ wall@@ ch@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal .
two further people were slightly injured .
the state road remains closed over hours .
&quot; after police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ nich came with their passenger car in the border with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying the L 333 in the direction of Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and dealers are planning &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; weekend
&quot; in September , Bad Lan@@ gen@@ pil@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping mall in the city centre . &quot;
the commercial club and the city administration wants to take advantage of the residents on the 8th and 9th of September to attract the inhabitants to the downtown shopping center .
&quot; like the chairman of the commercial , Christian King , the &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; will under@@ min@@ ate the customers that offers their own city off the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional providers are planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , native companies are to present their training plans . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city center will invite you to &quot; mit@@ ter@@ night shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action does not only contribute to residents of the city and in the vicinity .
&quot; in preparation for advertising spots in the radio , an Internet video and printed bags , which hin@@ ts to the share weekend , Christian King . &quot;
municipal and commercial association collabor@@ ate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; thus , the commercial club and the city will go into a further stage of the &quot; &quot; Attra@@ ctive Center &quot; &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers as the first &quot; Active Day &quot; to Brun@@ n@@ en@@ fest and sold @-@ in Sunday , talks with all tra@@ ders and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the ren@@ unci@@ ation of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potential should new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
guests include courses and tourists .
but many natives have lost the city center at a glance .
&quot; at the end , all to help to revi@@ ve the city center - to rent , the factories all over the city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; to overcome with a network the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y to overcome , which took part in the part , had said King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit Si@@ ich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Mü@@ hl@@ hausen , announced that five Thuring@@ ian cities took part in the nationwide &quot; &quot; Home @-@ Sh@@ opp@@ en &quot; &quot; nationwide . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ em@@ za , this Weimar , so@@ da , Heiligen@@ stadt and Abi@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day for the appreciation of local trade advert@@ ise and its importance for the community of our cities grow stronger , &quot; says I . &quot;
the action under the lead of the I@@ HK and with many partners do also make clear that every citizen can influence his direct environment itself .
two dead and several injured in US school
&quot; during construction , there was a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new other people were hurt .
&quot; there were two people killed in the US City in Minneapolis , and nine injured , some of them seriously wounded . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire brig@@ ade , on Wednesday ( local time ) , there was yet another in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building was collapsed .
initially Ver@@ mi@@ ster was later also dead .
&quot; among the dead , there were employees of the school . &quot;
as a lucky thing the authorities suspected working on a gas line .
&quot; at the time of the holiday season , few people were held in the Min@@ ne@@ haha Academy . &quot;
tr@@ ump made a pier@@ cing tran@@ scription of telephone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
&quot; Tran@@ scription of telephone calls between US president Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia , were published by Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump made a phone call with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , to say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. president imp@@ acted him because he had den@@ ounced the wall openly , and said to him , &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ ware , Mexico for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scription of his first appearance with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull has also been published and revealed a rep@@ utable exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the U.S. refugees who emigrated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; was , and that the existence on the trade , which was medi@@ ated by the Government of Obama , after becoming a ban on the settlement of refugees in the US . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump concluded the call after he had said the Lord &apos;s spe@@ c , that is the most un@@ pleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Moo@@ res Ford Bo@@ dies : activists conduct rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again
&quot; a 1948 @-@ spe@@ c Ford Mercury launched a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford bridge of Moore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which could reach four black passengers and a white driver , a group of white men stepped out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a man &apos;s middle age in a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous strip - took a long train on his cig@@ ar and looked at testing through the wind@@ shield .
dr@@ illed the occup@@ ants in fear .
&quot; we want this n -@@ --- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ ushed the man .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ aming the silence when a young black man was crushed by the passenger seat .
&quot; luck@@ ily , this terrible scene was played on July 22 , only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; Roger , &quot; nearly everyone in the audience w@@ ret@@ ched a very genuine sigh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 , Mayor of Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Mae Murray Dor@@ sey , was gel@@ syn@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was charged with murder .
&quot; it is truly in@@ comprehen@@ sible that no only person was arrested in all these years - although we know them in our congregations , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks which helps in the organisation of the reproduction . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Bro@@ oks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ voy of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil law@@ suit .
&quot; for him , the position as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual reminder of the Monroe community that there was no wrong corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want punishment , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; we cannot get to cure and reconciliation , until we receive justice . &quot;
a court @-@ medi@@ ator lays a towel on the body of one of the victims of Moore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ n on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI acts , received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but no one was charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on free foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions in the whole city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens to stop their voice at the first time in Georgia . &quot;
&quot; about at the same time as the choice of choice according to the FBI was made by the FBI Roger Mal@@ com , a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during one battle - supposedly due to a woman . &quot;
&quot; Bro@@ oks said the rum@@ or in the city was that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Ms. Dor@@ othy and that the baby she had , not from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to get Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
&quot; he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her cousin , Mae Murray and George Dor@@ sey . &quot;
&quot; but when they came to the prison from the prison , and the Moore &apos;s Ford Bridge came , surrounded by a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b . &quot;
&quot; as it emerg@@ es , it was Harrison who prepared the murders and arranged &quot; , &quot; includes an FBI &apos;s report . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosec@@ utions , which was not only involved in murder , pro@@ claims evidence and identity of witnesses . &quot;
Bro@@ oks makes it even more fun .
&quot; it was a electoral law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you register , and if you vote , then you will happen here . &quot;
Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Moore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de for a decade .
&quot; their representation is descri@@ p@@ tive , gri@@ pping and is justified in a kind of deep rac@@ ism , of whom many believe that in America he doesn &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and still difficult to watch , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because we are confron@@ ted with its hem@@ i@@ bility in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done . &quot;
&quot; the samples for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest Black - entered into a room and l@@ ur@@ passed when Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he played the role of the boss @-@ Cl@@ an@@ em@@ blem@@ an for years , but he said that the role will never be simpler . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so am , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to get this story in life , because we don &apos;t want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room the actor Dar@@ rius Brad@@ bury and Nick Ras@@ con@@ a , who plays Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester scre@@ ams and pushed him , angry that he slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , win@@ dy of my property ! &quot;
Ras@@ con@@ a reads the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone breaks ( at least all black actor ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the loud voice .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ con@@ a . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , always silent . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people at that time was &apos; n --- &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; wit@@ ness@@ ing one of the other black actors . &quot;
you only have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; .
&quot; and exactly , the energy is moving in space , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaced the un@@ eas@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins again .
&quot; this time Ras@@ con@@ a says the N word , he says it sharp and with a re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repet@@ ition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cry , k@@ is@@ ses and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman clothed with a garment dress , stands over the cor@@ p@@ ses of actors and leads cheap holidays , &quot; St@@ range Fru@@ it . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred yards behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators and tears came out of her eyes . &quot;
the audience is divided almost equally between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many come down only the road . &quot;
&quot; they lived for almost eight hours of Geor@@ gi@@ as , when Bro@@ oks led them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; up to this point , the Mor@@ se remains an Ane@@ cd@@ ote , but now , when one stands on the same country where Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , felt the air felt . &quot;
&quot; if the last notes of the songs sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to come closer and to inspec@@ t the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ per@@ ing each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; he mur@@ m@@ ur a little boy , as if he remember it . &quot;
&quot; after some minutes , Gre@@ ene thanks to the crowd - and suddenly it is over . &quot;
the actor throwing the ly@@ we@@ dge away and wi@@ pe her tears off .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w surro@@ unds Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit that the Cl@@ an@@ member has played . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ con@@ a h@@ ugs two of his players and breaks up in her arms , and breaks the emotional burden of the performance eventually with him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; &quot; whis@@ pers one of women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors together . &quot;
&quot; on a table , a white pair of Atlanta depic@@ ts a white pair of Atlanta , with a black couple who they had just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ inski strug@@ gled to find the words that had left the performance .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you yourself and that , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me , let me believe that the Lyn@@ chen continues to continue , &quot; &quot; he added , &quot; today the only police shooting is called . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Bro@@ oks court stops at his table , he eats and remembered the civil rights . &quot;
&quot; he said , he already started to plan the performance in the next year . &quot;
&quot; the follow @-@ up is inspir@@ ational , as it describes the horror of what we have borne , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; he who doesn &apos;t know his own story , who doesn &apos;t know his own story , is sentenced to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ d@@ u@@ chs &quot; reconc@@ iled the Wag@@ n@@ eri@@ ans to Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s mon@@ umental works , director Frank Cast@@ orf works on a colourful fri@@ vol@@ ous production of gigantic , six @-@ story scenes . &quot;
the rotary platform ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a fo@@ aming street corner with the wall of the Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin ; a &quot; Pl@@ aste and El@@ aste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .
&quot; previously , an open Mercedes classic car in which the Rhine is pos@@ ing as a rock@@ ing girl , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
stri@@ pped oil @-@ barrels recall Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and gre@@ ed - moving through his &quot; ring &quot; st@@ aging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ deadly sins - sung by Stephanie H@@ out@@ ze@@ el , Wie@@ b@@ ke L@@ etter@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra Steiner - as well as in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as a result , they run Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , in Hollywood @-@ Man@@ ier a body in the trunk and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; in Hagen , Stephen M@@ illing sings the au@@ vin@@ ous Hagen , who surro@@ unds the au@@ ra of a heavy musician . &quot;
&quot; brutal the scene , when he proposes Siegfried . &quot;
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) must believe on . &quot;
the audience thanks to the ensemble with powerful appl@@ ause .
&quot; Foster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski , who hum@@ bled himself and bowed his hands to Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; great appl@@ ause for the festival orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in view of the big heat again in empty leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance by Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am had been eag@@ erly anticipated .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a g@@ ell@@ ent pipe concert in 2013 , five years later , in which the individual &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; went down . &quot;
festive ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to be pleased about this .
&quot; it is noticeable that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it is also a understanding of its visibility . &quot;
I draw a positive summary .
Max Quant@@ ity works as a volunteer
they work in their own volunteers at several locations .
where to everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in Stein@@ furt in the furniture exchange , once a week I can help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have been working in the open whole day at school .
how are your experiences yet ?
&quot; amount : it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; now they are 26 years , so late @-@ term volunteers . &quot;
how does this come ?
amount : I have passed SL@@ C .
&quot; and then a construction engineer , let &apos;s say , successfully canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; I realized it would be known for me to do something that is wrong for me , and I want to do something else , with people . &quot;
and then I wondered what are you doing .
&quot; make a social year , as there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the distill@@ point perhaps , really is . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in social welfare in the winter semester .
&quot; I will be able to study , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study a social working education and study in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hochschule . &quot;
is it not unusual during the volunteer service to have several different kind of uses ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it does always happen on where to make his FS@@ J .
you can make it from the aging home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in O@@ gs , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was exactly the right thing that she has irrit@@ ated me .
I could recognize and see my own strengths as it really exp@@ ires .
unlike in Civil Engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well , here &apos;s not about ex@@ iting ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; one has always got other people &apos;s head , each with a quite different story behind him . &quot;
&quot; a refugee , whether a youth , who has been collected from the family , must always be made individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and they had no contact no@@ ises ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy .
there is a area that gives a lot .
&quot; much love , much kindness . &quot;

EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns decision to delay Smo@@ g Rule by Kl@@ agen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has decided to delay a government regulation of Obama , confir@@ ming that the states are committed to con@@ strain the smo@@ g @-@ caused emissions . this was a day after 15 states def@@ endants the agency for the def@@ endant . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to prop@@ el the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said that it showed the obligation to collabor@@ ate with States . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we will respond to our government partner , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June , to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in a part of the country of pollut@@ ant emissions have to be established in order to establish thor@@ ough air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , along with the district of Colombia , filed an action on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to resur@@ rec@@ t a broad range of environmental impact , former President Barack Obama , as part of a wider agenda , which is meant to boost economic growth according to tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have caused the response of the Democrats and the nature groups who cares about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the lung function and can increase the respiratory symptoms &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
Municipal Council wants to joint
&quot; at the end , the decision was clearly : with two counter@@ vote , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ ner decides to establish a common room in the pension residential area . &quot;
&quot; prior to discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing basic part is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it will take a long time until the church community has belonged to the municipal ownership , but there is no planning stage for the project by a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion concerning a common room .
&quot; one of the two investors who are still in the boat , offered to meet the church . &quot;
on the ground floor he would have a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters are available for a special price .
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council , such a common room was not just as the meeting point for the residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ate living housing , but open to the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word from the &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided in the last autumn , by convey@@ ing possibilities . &quot;
the building is in the restoration area .
&quot; the facility is a common area , reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the decision to signal the investor does not want to sign@@ alize him in this regard , indicating both saddle - what is reduced to the ambient structure - as well as the level roof - as well as the level @-@ height and construction of economic power - it would be possible . &quot;
&quot; unnecessary , not only Wil@@ fried So@@ h@@ mer thinks this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanimously he gets the panel .
it is not so easy with the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many other buildings , with which you don &apos;t get so righ@@ tly forward , it is now back@@ rest in the common room from the window , she says : &quot; I do not do it . &quot;
Y@@ v@@ onne Sta@@ ve definitely speaks for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal participation .
it looks behind a conce@@ aled sub@@ sid@@ y on anyway &apos;s assets or even foreign investors .
&quot; unless the acquisition of the surface is not allowed , because with the acquisition of the surface you don &apos;t give a chance , but will receive a real one , in doubt , is the counter@@ part . &quot;
&quot; request for Sta@@ ig@@ ers application to split the decision in accordance with respect , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; with two counter@@ voices in the original program , the Stefan H@@ aller puts it together : &quot; if we summar@@ ize the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge bridge in our infrastructure . &quot;
coll@@ ision by car : radar is sign@@ posted on road

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
it was last not good . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old does not believe in a performance increase in the first official approval of the season .
&quot; football is also tac@@ tics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .

hiking in the Star of Stern
&quot; in the resin , the national &quot; star path &quot; is supposed to be created . &quot;
this is the club Ob@@ servatory Saint Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planetary way in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star path &quot; come to the information needs of many resin visitors , called it . &quot;
&quot; it offers nature , science , motion and sporting performance . &quot;
the members want to open the route along the planned route tables and inform them about stars and stars .
&quot; in a first phase of 2018 , the association &quot; &quot; well att@@ ain@@ able installations &quot; &quot; plans to achieve five to six places in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question from St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ er , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be completed by the Internet .
&quot; therefore , the site selection includes a good mobile network reception . &quot;
accessibility is a crit@@ eri@@ on .
&quot; later , the Stern@@ berg Train has to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path the viewer experienced a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; stated the association . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star grew stronger than another , although it is substantially further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which constellation is a selected star , and when he is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the association has been operating since 2014 in the town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , the highest of the ob@@ servatory of Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of the National Park of Har@@ z is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda Galaxy with mere eye look clearly visible .
&quot; in the university city since 2003 , there has been something similar to the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium and something similar to the planned constellation - the planet . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet ends with its poles up to the Hain@@ berg and the ob@@ servatory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial site in Di@@ emar@@ den ( congregation of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
&quot; the stal@@ ks with the single planet , including the P@@ lu@@ to to the d@@ warf scheduled P@@ lu@@ to at the end point - are exact in the distance and scale of one to two billion . &quot;
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks as a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away from the sun . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet is just four kilometers .
&quot; while light from Sun to P@@ lu@@ to takes about eight hours , pede@@ stri@@ ans need a good hour until St@@ ele with P@@ lu@@ to . &quot;
pede@@ stri@@ ans are faster than light in the universe .
but the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .
Mik@@ ey Garcia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mik@@ ey Garcia , who should stand in a coll@@ ision course in order to st@@ icking the most exciting boxing fight in the near future of 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN @-@ offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the un@@ locked World Bo@@ xing Council &apos;s Ligh@@ tweight Champion , went down to Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing organization Super @-@ spring weight champion . &quot;
&quot; according to Gar@@ ci@@ as &apos;s victory through the unified decision of the former four @-@ divisions Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday , show@@ time both fighters of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list are both members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Garcia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you doing Champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 : 00 on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photographs , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters will be the &quot; perfect order &quot; . &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; reminiscent Garcia . &quot;
&quot; I have risen for bronze &#91; to 140 lbs &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I &apos;m small for 140 .
I want to add light weight .
and he must move to light weight &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
they demand the fans .
let &apos;s give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko voted in .
&quot; boxing needs this battle . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 pound debut in this year to make a date in the next summer with Garcia a date ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also had interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell after their lightweight @-@ weight title in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all fans have asked him , &quot; &quot; said Garcia and squee@@ zed out later to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
when are they ready ... &quot;
&quot; Garcia said , he insi@@ sts Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he might be able to take part in his Saturday fight . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko held with the generous praise for Garcia and said that he think of the three battle champion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; very slowly , sorry Mik@@ ey ... you wanted to do the Ko @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Garcia said , the focus was to show impact strength , then boxing . &quot;
&quot; both said they could feel the moment@@ um , that built up for its own struggle . &quot;
this is the battle that must be performed .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work , &quot; said Garcia . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; I have waited for the top fighter and that &apos;s Mik@@ ey .
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four last to tire plat@@ ers
&quot; during an accident on A7 , four people were seriously injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of a Opel Z@@ af@@ ira was shortly before the entrance of the Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16 : 30 , probably after a tire plat@@ ter to control over his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the passenger moved to the right to the ar@@ mist@@ aken , where he over@@ threw himself and then remained on the roof in the grave . &quot;
the four passengers - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first power of the injuries by the rescue service , the A7 toward the north for about an hour was locked , and the traffic on the left hand was passed by the accident place . &quot;
Fort@@ unas Hoffmann : &quot; turning chain works better &quot;
&quot; Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season open@@ er against Braunschweig , giving the optimization of the def@@ ensive information in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andre Hoffmann was happy with the result , as the two areas would not have been at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two areas too much , and we have to watch even better in Au@@ e , &quot; says Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Erz@@ gebirge should be further optimized .
and a gate after a free stum@@ bling would not be sn@@ ared even more .
&quot; for the future , it will be so that no longer represents Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) to the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his crew is better to improve the experiences in preparation with the thres@@ hing chain , than with the four . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know how we will inter@@ act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Fun@@ cles , but Hoffmann is sure because we just have in the rotating chain to the half positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and N@@ iko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build up . &quot;
&quot; pr@@ er@@ equ@@ is@@ ite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ ious and we do not afford such a number of toys in the building . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also travels to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can speak after a draw from a mis@@ embar@@ rass@@ ing start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; performance could be quite okay , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and will focus on the cup , we will certainly speak of a regular season open@@ er . &quot;
of that his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start into the season is only after six to eight playing days , &quot; &quot; said Fried@@ helm Fun@@ kel , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage over Au@@ e , only because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a temp@@ est . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season quasi with a home game , &quot; said Fun@@ kel and Hoffmann , that the players may be even more fresh , because they could not have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una for a boost @-@ favorite in bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing &quot; , &quot; says the defense of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
although guests from the Rhineland are easier for the Rhineland as an easier favorite on Sunday in the last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we carry them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid , &quot; says Fun@@ cles , whose balance is only a defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there are no crew in the 2nd Bundesliga , which one must hit from the front , &quot; explains Fort@@ unas Music coach . &quot;
&quot; such a statement would be arro@@ gant and excessive . &quot;
and so Fun@@ cles will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum assessment tests published
&quot; the recent findings of tests for asylum seek@@ ers in Sweden , subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish Authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine was launched last year with the implementation of testing tests .
&quot; during the asylum process , they are supposed to be more exact during the asylum process after the Swedish migration agency ( mig@@ r@@ ations ) because of errors in jud@@ ging the correct age of some refugees were crit@@ ici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; until today , mig@@ r@@ ations have shipped 6,@@ 880 cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to July 31 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ ty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency affir@@ med that the person was &quot; &quot; maybe 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person &quot; may be under 18 years old .
tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are constantly stable during the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of last months , the numbers are quite constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seek@@ ers have been lied to over its age . &quot;
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that it was 4@@ 42 cases giving the study to be examined 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bl@@ adet points out the 5@@ 81 results , it noted that in 243 of these cases the person declared that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical assessment , done in the x @-@ rays of white teeth and MRI images of knee joints , which are then analysed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , was also crit@@ ici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tics is the En@@ do@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work comprises the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see whether they were sooner or later than the pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
to assess the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do so as if we could &quot; , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of jud@@ ging a child is un@@ equal to adults . &quot;
&quot; the greatest risk is in this case , if the person is close to 18 , this case is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in Plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well ahead .
on Wednesday a seven @-@ tonn@@ e concrete was installed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; we are very good in time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , builders at the department of road and traffic in the gover@@ ning committee of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , work simultaneously began on all three renov@@ ating bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is intended for October and is sure that the tim@@ etable is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads across the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted bridge made of concrete , lined with a red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4,@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , she has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three construction works are thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges perform across the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built from red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach has now on Wednesday morning , a 1.@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called Br@@ ück@@ appe . &quot;
this is an edge attachment which is also used as an operating path .
&quot; on Friday , a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge kit is to be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then you want to run the pedestrian walk@@ way .
the particular thing is that it is a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger firm Di@@ zw@@ o .
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented br@@ ush@@ caps .
special finger@@ tip has the placing of lines required through the plant in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a glass fibre cable , where many companies are connected . &quot;
the people were informed about the projects in advance of hand@@ outs on the projects .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for bridges between the building farm building and the collection , in direction Sch@@ ram@@ berg is the traffic inter@@ mitt@@ edly regulated by an amp@@ el . &quot;
&quot; for construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ b@@ acher &apos;s entrance , the road is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; &quot; Tann@@ ery &quot; &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the costs for the three bri@@ dging operations are 700 000 euros .
it is funded by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : dis@@ regarding protest in German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t come so often that parties will go on a strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , what else is difficult to get under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the Parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance , which shows peaceful flags that day in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell . &quot;
&quot; and known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land , is the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24th , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k . &quot;
&quot; but those who are in the start of the event already before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the af@@ ers , but demonstrated . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town pic@@ nic is planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the fountain place , but now takes place on the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
&quot; a colourful picture , which offers itself . &quot;
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chair of the forum One World and one of the relevant organizers , really pleased : &quot; great how many people have come together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and plenty of food , including a &quot; ur@@ red potato salad , which could also eat the A@@ ds without any problems , &quot; says the woman who brought him with him . &quot;
&quot; police has hired many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein and shows presence , especially at the railway station , which is just a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes reported by the Af@@ D Vulkan@@ ei@@ fel that he has been trying to obtain such an event and get the supplement out of this event .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf initially asked in Dau@@ n , but there was not a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ k not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; overlooking the event , he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peace@@ fully . &quot;
&quot; this is also : at 20 o &apos;clock , the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the Stad@@ thalle diverse speakers , among them the Rhineland @-@ p@@ fal@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ Chair Uwe Young . &quot;
&quot; in the hall are about 200 listen@@ ers , who are waiting for the top can@@ did@@ act for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ k will keep their speech@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unchanged , the police presence , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour takes the Af@@ D event , guests at the fore@@ ground have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;

Kri@@ sten Stewart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese , and they will eat it until the end of their life . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; as Kri@@ sten Stewart is quite openly about her bis@@ ex@@ ual . &quot;
&quot; once I bite to grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
the best known relationship of Hollywood star was the one of her &quot; Twi@@ light &quot; colleagues Robert Patt@@ inson which ultimately became bitter .
&quot; in spite of all , the brunette perform@@ ers insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love seriously who I made . &quot;
or do you think about that I had played it ?
&quot; after their separation , Kri@@ sten was said that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I &apos;ve always lived and believed the du@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; it has never confused me , or impe@@ ded me . &quot;
I never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; she has suffered particularly , according to the &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; but in school time , as she felt like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really really hurt me .
&quot; when I eleven , the children told me , I would look like a Bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and frigh@@ tened and con@@ founded .
&quot; now , I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; especially the public , they do not love to love her love life : &quot; people expect you to be a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and maybe they describe me some as und@@ ank@@ able , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
&quot; Virginia Governor , Virginia Governor , announces that he changes the party . &quot;
&quot; Democratic Governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; &quot; said Governor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and much of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabit@@ ant of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , &quot; added Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a coach , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised a great announcement in the West Virginia Rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not support the democratic candidate of the Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Forbes puts firmly that he possesses coal em@@ ines in five states , and inherited from his father a hydro@@ car@@ nation . &quot;
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republican National Committee announced a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the Party change of Governor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party who would like to work more than to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 g@@ os and control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Governor Justice is only the last re@@ jection of a party , which is not able to find a positive , reason@@ ably clear message , &quot; said the R@@ NC chair R@@ onna Mc@@ Daniel in a statement to the C@@ BS News . &quot;
CO@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian exc@@ use for d@@ oping sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of Athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised , on Thursday , what he described as an obvious exc@@ use from Russia to a d@@ oping sc@@ andal but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sport . &quot;
&quot; during the IA@@ AF congress &apos;s World Athle@@ tics Championships on the eve of World Athle@@ tics Championships on the eve of World Athle@@ tics World Championships , that the ban of his country was correct and that he decided to fight D@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; all athletes , those who have carved gold medals and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for maintaining the ban , which was hanged in November 2015 , after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) was found in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF president Co@@ e the Rep@@ orters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire congress were delighted that the Russian Federation recognized itself to themselves , that they have experienced some quite hot times and everything is possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; in addition , CO@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia will accept the criteria for its re @-@ launch . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very construc@@ tive day , and I think of progress has been achieved , but the Congress supporting the task of Task Force that this was not the moment to use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize the situation .
&quot; the principle was always , that we wanted to separate the clean athl@@ ete from the with@@ ered system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; nin@@ et@@ een Russian athletes will compete with the athle@@ tics World Championships , which will start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria for neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the director of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia had to fulfil some of the criteria for a re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; thr@@ ills are still in@@ adequate and prohibited . still active , he said rep@@ orters in London after a lecture at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral proc@@ ession for a funeral proc@@ ession in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the Nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Fr@@ itz@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two were designed by a helicopter in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the Dom@@ stadt under high security measures .
&quot; to still un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Defence , Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CDU ) . &quot;
&quot; they described the two drivers , but as &quot; C@@ ould of their profession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to this highest sacrifice , which they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Chief of Chief of the Northern H@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a death status of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er cathedral St. Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives of the church had arrived . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral proc@@ ession began in the circle of the family , eng@@ ster friends , representatives of the army and politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CDU ) and the General Inspec@@ torate of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Ho@@ ker .
trau@@ mat@@ s laid down ro@@ ses who stood at arm in arm in arm .
&quot; before the church , Fr@@ itz@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence from the Le@@ yen , designated soldiers as a &quot; highly decorated &quot; and one @-@ sat@@ in @-@ one . &quot;
&quot; in Fr@@ itz@@ lar , he built the air@@ crafts of the batt@@ les@@ hip Tiger in Fr@@ itz@@ lar and was one of the first six listed tiger pilots of his regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regim@@ ent to whom the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this crew could not turn off the overthrow , nobody would have mo@@ cked . &quot;
doubts about the UN mission in Mali was not one of the le@@ ft@@ ist : the use was dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of great importance for a country , of whom we are only separated by two states , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik wants no grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried under his death after his death . &quot;
that shared the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already have a sar@@ cop@@ h@@ agus for both of them .
&quot; the Queen was understood by her husband &apos;s decision , it was further in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik was buried there is still un@@ clear .
but he did not have the intention of being buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik never had a H@@ eh@@ l of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the thr@@ on@@ ment of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 he went into retirement , and also sets the title &quot; prin@@ cess@@ es . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik in Denmark didn &apos;t get the title and the function , which he wanted , he will not see himself as equivalent to his wife , but not after death , L@@ ene Bal@@ le@@ by , the leader of the Danish Royal House . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old is ultimately un@@ clear , it is still un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; born in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French arist@@ oc@@ racy , had met Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
on the Th@@ ames he worked in the French Embassy .
&quot; throughout his future wife , prince Hen@@ rik had always had a heavy state in his almost 50 years of rainy days . &quot;
&quot; in a auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , so@@ oth@@ ills instead of Stri@@ ck@@ so@@ cks , Citroën instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smoke instead of Virginia @-@ tobacco and who had the reputation to be the brand of social intellectual intellec@@ tuals , I could not hope in respect . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re @-@ election
CDU and F@@ DP before possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; defe@@ ating Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after losing the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the country , does not want to re@@ sign . &quot;
because he spoke on Friday for the dis@@ solution of the Parliament .
&quot; before that , the surprising outlet had over@@ thrown a Green Party in the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
five months before the official date of the country @-@ election the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost their scar@@ ce a vote majority in parliament to the CDU and F@@ DP .
the former Green @-@ member El@@ ke T@@ eller founded their step with the non @-@ nomin@@ ation for the 2018 election in its election circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ m@@ me ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CDU , &quot; she explained in Hannover on Friday . &quot;
CDU president Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his group to include them .
&quot; the CDU and F@@ DP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Parliament , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relation was revers@@ ed .
the new Parliament will be elected regular yearly on 14 January .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said , the red @-@ green state government must now decide whether they could rule out without a majority in this situation . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , however , believes that the Land@@ tag decides to quickly decide his self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CDU faction is expected to decide on Tuesday on Tuesday .
&quot; the state constitution also sees the possibility that the Prime Minister , the Prime Minister , cho@@ oses the trust and sel@@ ects a successor . &quot;
&quot; our constitution offers several options .
&quot; these possibilities must be legally examined clean , &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions when they are legally reason@@ ably checked . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called the west step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the polit@@ ician himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described as a post@@ pon@@ der of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called the Socialists and Democrats called for the return of their country day .
&quot; we assume , of course , that she has received her landing gear which she has received about the green state list , with immediate effect returns , distributed the regional met@@ a Janssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
the Group president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ IEL said : &quot; we regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ v@@ ests extra@@ ordin@@ arily . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead the pron@@ unci@@ ation in the group .
&quot; even before the background , there were no content differences , we cannot compreh@@ end this step . &quot;
SPD candidate for Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the convic@@ tions of the Lower Saxony @-@ Socialist Party in Alsace to CDU than betra@@ yal .
&quot; the conduct of former Green Party in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the Bund@@ esch@@ ef of the S &amp; D Group on Friday . &quot;
he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to re @-@ choose the Land@@ tag quickly .
the Austr@@ o @-@ Green is red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the polit@@ ician &quot; &quot; in its ver@@ ending vanity and in her fru@@ strations have their personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised the SPD @-@ General Hu@@ ber@@ tus salvation . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CDU in Lower Saxony makes this dirty In@@ tri@@ gen@@ y and tried to beat political capital .
precipitation of the CDU @-@ president Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his M@@ EPs to welcome El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ er into the CDU .
&quot; the president of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , threw the v@@ ests to fall down the outcome of the 2013 country election . &quot;
&quot; the CDU was the strongest force at that time in the SPD , and the SPD and Green were a very small majority in the country &apos;s Parliament . &quot;
&quot; Home Affairs Minister - How do we protect us from Gi@@ ft@@ ei@@ vers , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed about contam@@ inated eggs .
how could sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
the Minister for Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is an interview with the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and response .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect you from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all the consumers and consumers to check the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ grocery war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the states represent the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all , what we do currently know is practically impossible to health haz@@ ards . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis re@@ action - all eggs get out of the offer - because the central role of recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance from the Federal Minister of Agriculture is not really perceived ?
food monitoring is the task of the Federal States .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has broken up and is located since dis@@ closure of Germany &apos;s close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk evaluation are available to consumers .
&quot; the trade has just like the manufacturer to concern yourself , that the sold products are traffic and health un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; if eggs of the spine of 0.00@@ 5@@ mg / kg is exceeded , these are not suitable . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time does not blame the factories .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to der@@ ze@@ al knowledge , production companies hits no immediate debt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must be reck@@ oned with economic damage due to mut@@ ually illegal practices . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is too little checking in time . &quot;
is it just missing on the staff or even on the st@@ ony conditions ?
&quot; there were just the official controls , which have revealed the process . &quot;
&quot; however , the truth also belongs that food fraud and criminal energy can never be made up to 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there are therefore a consistent enlighten@@ ment of such happening and handed over to the public authorities in cases where crimes can be found , of crucial importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already made several times already , that I expect a bridge @-@ free enlighten@@ ment by the responsible authorities . &quot;
is the regular alarm system really necessary in food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers and consumers have the right to get exclusively secure and efficient foods .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ de is used in the food industry , consumers and consumers are entitled to law . &quot;
&quot; due to the pan@@ elled resources , manufacturers , tra@@ ders and consumers are gro@@ unded in a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ ci@@ des Fi@@ pro@@ il in the attitude of life @-@ food animals is not acceptable , and must be termin@@ ated immediately . &quot;
&quot; it must be worked on all levels , consistent with high pressure . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all relevant authorities , that the atomic fact is clari@@ fied and cleared . &quot;
how does the financial rules of football to move to Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to Paris
&quot; the rules that aim to target un@@ hin@@ dered issues of European football matches will not inter@@ fere with Ne@@ ym@@ ars world record transfer from Spain to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will come to Paris Saint @-@ Germain from UEFA , for the leading organization that the European game has supervised the power to provide teams from the access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , which have been called from the UEFA Cup 2011 , will mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer of Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without great losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid € 222 million ( 262 million dollars ) to buy the Brazilian market from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary which will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ ym@@ ars move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can make money for the money , so that Ne@@ ym@@ ar is under@@ writing and bring it to another stars in view of the financing of the team through the rich ruler family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs may apply a lot of money for the purchase of players , but must have legitim@@ ate revenue sources , which allow them to make the break @-@ even point in her on the football @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; on his election to UEFA President in 2007 , FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs in their quest for success had taken tremendous debt , effectively frau@@ dul@@ ent and ris@@ ky to ru@@ in@@ ize , if banks or owners have returned their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P for@@ ged from concentration to the debt of the clubs on the monitoring of their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel Abr@@ am@@ o@@ vich used originally in 2003 in Chelsea - invested a club with potential and then strongly invested to build a global brand - to build a harder matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini fell from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor to Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in continues to deter them from excessive issues . &quot;
&quot; certainly FF@@ P is not dead and we will strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEFA for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a l@@ ump sum , it can distribute the amount for the invoice about the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the de@@ but@@ ors for the next five years can be exp@@ elled at EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has made the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which later was reduced to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members for the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEFA is searching for clubs , who might try to super@@ vis@@ ing their financial views by joining their revenue by companies that are linked to owners of a clubs . &quot;
&quot; while a cataly@@ tic company could replace PS@@ G , if the value of the sponsor@@ ship should exceed the standard market leader , the UEFA would not apply as legitim@@ ate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of the Spon@@ sor@@ ing of the PSA of Qatar Tourism Authority was blo@@ oming . &quot;
it has been reported that a part of PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar will be on payments by the 2022 Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
&quot; but PS@@ G and Qatar , 2022 , cont@@ ested that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Cup Amb@@ ass@@ adors will be able to find out a great man@@ oeu@@ vre for UEFA regulatory authorities . &quot;
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEFA is still attentive to consider any attempt to avoid the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEFA had no pre @-@ prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on Ne@@ ym@@ ars Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke under the condition of an@@ on@@ ym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not fug@@ iti@@ oned to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 generated sales of € 54@@ 2.4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
the accounts for the last financial year must be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s arrival a blessing for Spon@@ sor@@ ing @-@ De@@ als , Mer@@ chan@@ dis@@ ing and Tri@@ pod . &quot;
the association assumes that its sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing of the signature .
&quot; the Spanish league was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football player , and she tried to prevent Ne@@ ym@@ ar &apos;s delay , claiming that PS@@ G would viol@@ ate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &apos; financed D@@ oping &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ars , the official owner of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal @-@ manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American Sport ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations from La League against a state that co @-@ financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and this has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country owns a club , everything is possible . &quot;
it will be very difficult to respect the financial fair@@ play because you can have different ways or have different interests when a country has such a big actor to represent a country .
Swiss is searching for a new ch@@ og@@ gi@@ ants
&quot; in the past few years , Chocol@@ ate Fre@@ y is made on board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the committees concluded before a possible end : the airline is rev@@ amped the order .
Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ p confirmed on request by the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ western Switzerland &quot; from Friday .
&quot; in the first half of 2018 , Air@@ line will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subjected to a quality control .
&quot; with the current vendor Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; said S spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; some 17 million small red @-@ white sheets , packed with 14 grams a year , spread the aviation leaders in front of the landing to the passengers . &quot;
&quot; above the cost , the Swiss Life wanted no information . &quot;
&quot; industry insi@@ sts estimate the order volume according to the &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ Swiss &quot; &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros @-@ daughter achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more import@@ antly is the effect effect : for a shame manufacturer it is a prestigious order .
&quot; as many applicants on the new call , Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss market . &quot;
but there are only Swiss manufacturers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper Report , Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make a renewal of the Treaty establishing the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the S@@ DA , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss chocolate tablets distributed its flights to Swiss flights . &quot;
&quot; before Swiss signed a contract with Mig@@ ros daughter , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
&quot; the possibility to place the logo , presented Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
the airline operates with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long distance trips , the customers of the first class with treats are spo@@ iled by the conf@@ ection@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gl@@ i , in business class n@@ ags passengers Sch@@ og@@ gi by Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;
&quot; also on short distance , Swiss Sch@@ og@@ gi of Chocol@@ at Fre@@ y distributed both in business as well as in Economy Class . &quot;

&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adult who are now adults , is less emotional ro@@ oted and its par@@ ody goes more according to the found@@ ly @-@ known principle , including one Reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand That cra@@ dle the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point , a character is inspired by an Apple Power@@ book , some in@@ line skating and a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ et@@ akers ) , now novel@@ ist , has never forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mo@@ reau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its vir@@ g@@ inity .
and there are yet another crazy @-@ mal@@ icious plot that is included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Sho@@ et@@ aker ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it makes a lot of fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rud@@ d , who shows Matt D@@ alli@@ on sub@@ li@@ pp@@ art of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ camp Andy feels like an old h@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of random mad@@ ness that could pre@@ heat this fran@@ chise , like a sort of repet@@ itive conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose latest scene I will show how they will visit the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon was now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : on the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ low &quot; with his East @-@ against @-@ West Ring @-@ I@@ con@@ ography . &quot;

the main tro@@ t - a hard @-@ minded Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u U@@ lic@@ i whose dialog@@ s of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized in English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some beautiful G@@ ags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time to watch chess in television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous speaker - including Jenny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Sev@@ ign@@ y - ensures a decent play &apos; Fin@@ de the voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is committed so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desper@@ ate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer that carries a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays as a single one .
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves away , and the com@@ edy isn &apos;t fast or frequently enough . &quot;
&quot; com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , who has been re@@ dig@@ ged to a smaller length , could visit his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p @-@ S@@ ati@@ re better since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef once again visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who scra@@ pped a he@@ ap ham@@ burger . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ ined communist audience is that western culture can do everything for a joint age .
the fic@@ tive Romanian creator were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with her .
blow against Drugs @-@ Mafia in the country
the police has been a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects are searched , as the Public Prosecutor &apos;s office was on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 25 , 15 civilians were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 , and issued arrest warran@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the officials presented larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
&quot; at the same Raz@@ icia in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will therefore be delivered to Germany .
&quot; in the operation , Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved . &quot;
&quot; in total , over 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Mafia was accused drug criminal , heavy violence , attempted murder , and rob@@ ber@@ y . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the public prosecutor &apos;s office has been determined against organised drug retailers in the South German area . &quot;
between the State bar in Constance and Palermo there was a re@@ active exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil in almost daily contact with their colleagues at Sicily .
therefore it was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo at Wednesday morning .
&quot; in particular , Italian nationals combined with respect to Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ fingen , fired at the early morning several shots in a restaurant , is likely to go into the gang of bonds . &quot;
Weise compl@@ ains major g@@ aps in the fore@@ igner register
&quot; citizens of citizens who should not appear : according to a report , the fore@@ igner register has significant defects in Germany . &quot;
this lead to part serious fail@@ ures in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s refugee management , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , a media report , according to a media report , has been att@@ enti@@ vely attentive to large numbers in the extension register . &quot;
&quot; the data of the registered data could result in an analysis of the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; in an analysis for asylum procedures and deportation . &quot;
&quot; according to the register , there are ten million people with foreign nationals , including some 5.7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign agencies in Germany .
&quot; because the data have not been maintained enough , the data quality in parts have not been so far so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 have been found , &quot; by people who have long not been alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register anymore . &quot;
&quot; wrong data collection may slow down the recur@@ ring processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of the trav@@ eller @-@ speaking people , the EU citizen who would not have to travel . &quot;
&quot; such false assign@@ ments led &quot; to a dist@@ orted debate on dealing with trav@@ ellers , &quot; says it in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government apparently began to return refugee families with under 16 @-@ year @-@ old children , when they travelled from there to Italy . &quot;
&quot; the return from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( B@@ AM@@ F ) reports , reports the &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ re Newspaper . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the paper , the B@@ AM@@ F exam@@ ines such procedures &quot; regarding families with children , with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since June 1 , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , it was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper wrote under reference to the difficult situation . &quot;
&quot; following the Dublin agreement , the EU states is responsible for refugees in the EU states . &quot;
&quot; if a mig@@ rant travels into another EU country , this state can send him back to the country . &quot;
&quot; for the reasons , the office now write : &quot; meanwhile the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased significantly . &quot;
I gave Italy for the recording and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) hold this commitment to sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees to the Dublin agreement as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; internal political spokesperson on the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children strug@@ gling for lack of defects in the Italian asylum system of human right conditions and a companion of child welfare . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; a total of 220 litres of blood of in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach live individuals , the blood @-@ endemic service is already available for other people . &quot;
&quot; at least by the twelve citizens , who were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; thanks to all , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has meanwhile received 50 litres of blood in the meantime , made donations in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the congregation in the meeting of the Municipal Council has made multiple read@@ iness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is in@@ gen@@ ious , as our body is created for it , and we z@@ ollen the fund@@ able respect that their blood are available for foreigners , nor for it un@@ pec@@ uli@@ ar , &quot; under@@ lined may@@ ors of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one only blood@@ stream helps several people , &quot; explained the county seat of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Amar@@ enb@@ acher , because the preser@@ ves are broken into their components . &quot;
&quot; for example , three people could benefit from a blood sp@@ elling . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported of the actions that will be carried out in the Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach in spring . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K @-@ Kreis@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the@@ atri@@ cal house has led to higher number of participants in a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; in front of this , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Meta Um@@ bre@@ ls were among the multi @-@ sp@@ ies and were awarded platinum for each 50 years . &quot;

the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce that interest rates remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have decreased over an increase . &quot;
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; will remain &quot; &quot; when they join the interest rates in the middle of a intensi@@ fying pressure . &quot;
&quot; in this month , the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers ( M@@ PC ) agreed to hold interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % . in this month , fewer members have an increase , because the weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its fourth annual rate of inflation , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and in 2018 on 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on household income would continue to continue to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest income should be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the credit costs may have to rise more than expected to the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agree to withdraw a part of the mamm@@ oth economic stimul@@ us , which was issued a year after the Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for financial planning to al@@ locate funds for banks , even though it is said that now it is expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the rate of interest , the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak , as the pressure on the real ones of households will still affect consumption . &quot;
&quot; on the rate of interest rates , they repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; for cooling of inflation and a &quot; somewhat bigger &quot; dimension would be required as the markets expect . &quot;
the markets is currently forecast for the first quarter of the next year and another one in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank however stressed that increases &quot; &quot; gradually &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Bank forecast down@@ ward growth forecasts for this and next year , compared to May projected 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May . &quot;
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell on these messages over the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change occurs after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have increased the increasing expectations of interest rate fail@@ ures , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months increased to 0.3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households who will be affected by increasing inflation and low @-@ level sal@@ aries , as the tigh@@ ter first becomes worse before they will improve . &quot;
&quot; it is added that the monetary policy in the next few years may not stop the income of income , &quot; but they added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecast . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , which is attributable to weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate a part of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes in a year after lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August , after the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the P@@ fun@@ ct . &quot;
&quot; the Bank estimates that it will last for four years , until the prices and the economy will completely reach completely . &quot;
&quot; prior to the last judgement of the Bank to the interest rate , the reputation had increased after a interest rate , while inflation was increased to hard @-@ urged households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and re @-@ opened it in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said , it aims at a ratio of 2 % in relation to its goal of 2 % . &quot;
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ ly , director at Co@@ rec@@ o Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the shortest review of the s@@ wap rate , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive than the credit@@ ors are still looking for shops and to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market is especially good for those who close the existing stretching and the new mort@@ g@@ ages , and many with free @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) should rub a controversial HIV drug 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transformation &quot; HIV @-@ pre@@ venti@@ onal treatment starting from September following a fight against the financing of the medicine in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that one prior to the sexual intercourse was recorded ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high risk areas by around 86 percent , now from the health service over a first three year study . &quot;
&quot; he was willing to finance the process after the Court of Appeal uph@@ eld a judgment of the Supreme Court in the previous year , under which the N@@ HS had to pay the authority to the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that the local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the Chess was announced on Thursday by N@@ HS England CEO Simon Stev@@ ens as &quot; important new intervention &quot; , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be among the first to be eligible for registration of people and further clinics will follow in October , before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre @-@ positioning phy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV medicine that are taken in front of the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP significantly reduced the HIV transmission in Inf@@ ection .
pr@@ EP before sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; to those who come to the treatment of question , gay or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners , who have not been treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , suitable participants are identified who agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti @-@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
&quot; people who live in England and registered with a hom@@ atri@@ cian , can also opt @-@ in for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic . &quot;
the program will take £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines in this week after an international competitive pro@@ curement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire potential of Pr@@ EP , collected by clinical evidence as targeted in a large scale , and implemented . &quot;
Stev@@ ens said : &quot; this large new intervention was to complement and over@@ take care of HIV and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of continuing progress in response to one of the greatest health challenges of mankind .
&quot; Deborah Gold , Chief Executive for NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ EP , if it is targeted in need for needy and endangered people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to become people with a high HIV @-@ risk access to this N@@ HS @-@ financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument , which is really individual controlled and not subject to a negoti@@ ation with a partner , leading to many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority now has to be carried out in the whole country and that no one who has left the risk of HIV . &quot;
&quot; now when the P@@ EP test medicine was purchased , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Sharon Hodg@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is welcome after months of delay and hes@@ itation by the government and over@@ due . &quot;
&quot; evidence shows , how trans@@ forming this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention , and termin@@ ate the transmission of these li@@ fel@@ ong infection . &quot;
this attempt brings us a step closer to the understanding of the Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will contribute to the termination of HIV in society a step closer . &quot;
life live : mezzanine and clever designer tricks this small Ear@@ ls Court apartment transformed into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with passion for real estate , resi@@ sted in 2014 from a large house in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed her bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kn@@ igh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I sought for something that was comparable to my price .
this apartment was shown in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
&quot; I fell in love with her , and made an offer on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1.000 square foot was over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed completely over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; originally a one @-@ room property with a f@@ iller layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne reservoir and a mezzanine to optim@@ ally use the generous ceiling height . &quot;
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; it was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she assigned the architecture and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine , where you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think of creative thinking about feeding the int@@ ent .
&quot; the ste@@ el@@ work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed , without letting us g@@ aps . &quot;
&quot; it wasn &apos;t just about building a simple platform , but to put the steel so that it had the right height above or down . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window of ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ am@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mir@@ ro@@ red gold furniture , silver acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of sk@@ e@@ wers plays a role in adding Theater , Space and Light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mir@@ ro@@ red to work for longer . &quot;
in the kitchen you feel like a window in another room .
&quot; at the entrance , mir@@ ro@@ red units for every beast and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the perception of a gl@@ am@@ our@@ y space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen , if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a little engineer went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel @-@ reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is opposite , so if you push the door High , easy to guide . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Jo@@ anne was able to win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ diment@@ ary form , real estate agents will enter and create a calculation based on the floor space . &quot;
&quot; here they managed to enlarge the floor area and simultaneously use high @-@ quality materials , which provide the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and they therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love you in electrical outlets in the walls .
&quot; they are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
&quot; it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design , and increased square meters of something completely different . &quot;
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could choose to leave this not . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation for one of the biggest real estate markets Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &quot; Carl@@ ton Football Club &quot; and &quot; Colin De Lut@@ is &quot; is living in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and its assets shall be divided . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp discussion on the separation is held in the Supreme Court .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have gathered 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family purchased a business in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there the West@@ co family founded Je@@ ans , and grew up to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lut@@ is now includes offices in the urban area , the areas of Bruns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late Father , Colin - Paul is described as &quot; principal operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; in the family De Lut@@ is , about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a judicial file said that Colin &apos;s property is worth 316 million dollars and Paul worth a value of 176 million dollars .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved for Paul as a pro@@ bl@@ ance point .
&quot; the Colin proposed th@@ ec@@ tives have left him with the left which I kept for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in the first affair in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; after several failed , the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice had been held last Friday . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now strug@@ gling to control over the existing business - including Colin , as Paul claims to be excluded . &quot;
&quot; Colin argu@@ ed that this is not true , but she throws Paul to manage some possessions . &quot;
&quot; in an early affair that was submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to join the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian inheritance writes , that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs rise in the fall , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , among them Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading attor@@ neys , including Allan My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides held law firm . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lut@@ is and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ ac@@ at@@ essen from the late 1950 @-@ s and bought a business in Bruns@@ wick in the early 1970s . &quot;
they used the safety to buy the coll@@ ing@@ wood property in the Colin made the first Je@@ ans@@ load of the family .
Colin says that he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of High School , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lut@@ is says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hop@@ ed to continue their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me , that he never wanted to land the brothers . &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are not part of the De Lut@@ is Corporate Group , whereby Colin claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million for leaving the company . &quot;
&quot; Luke as well as Mark are , says Paul &quot; has become bitter@@ ness above the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Colin made herself very well although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of Eddie Mc@@ Gu@@ ire and the best friend of television stars in 2015 .
Fair@@ fax Media participated with Colin and Paul De Lut@@ is and their lawyers .
&quot; only Colin responded by SMS to say &quot; I can really say a lot , &quot; because the case is before the dishes . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to acc@@ use me and to draw our sur@@ name through the dishes , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother . &quot;
&quot; our father would not wanted that Paul and I would end in our current contro@@ versy , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he is still looking for a solution . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our matter will be solved in the near future of the courts , &quot; wrote Colin . &quot;
Tr@@ um@@ ps of Chief of Staff is planning to limit the media failure of the President .
others tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , it will be the first . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information on President tr@@ ump - including reports from news media , hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course . &quot;
here is a piece of reporter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , who met new Chief of Staff of the White House , in his first working day with leading employees , he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ um@@ ps White House , which he wants to repair : poor information that got into the hands of President . &quot;
&quot; Kelly said the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in letter , because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information . &quot;
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagn@@ oses makes sense , but others have attempted to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump in order to monitor its media coverage . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ um@@ ps relationship with television goes back for decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertisement is still very strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate was off@@ ended for an un@@ fair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of digits , &quot; said the former election agent Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February versus POL@@ IT@@ ICO . &quot;
&quot; in the time , Polit@@ ic@@ os Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key , Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it , &quot; says to ensure that his personal media consumption includes an ste@@ ady praise prize . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ um@@ ps Twitter hab@@ it ever &quot; under control &quot; was ridic@@ ulous .
perhaps this Figh@@ ters officials know something that we don &apos;t know others - that Tr@@ um@@ ps T@@ we@@ ets without their interventions still contain more ignition .
we will probably never learn anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t sent .
&quot; if his employees manage it already some times , anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
but nobody has failed to prevent Tr@@ ump contro@@ versy .
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a white house come together again , trying to present their own agenda by presenting its own agenda by promoting tr@@ ump material , which may be able to promote their views from the world . &quot;
POL@@ IT@@ ICO - primarily dealing with this story - reported that in May about the pre@@ ference of advis@@ ors to conc@@ ise the pre@@ ference for strategic reasons .
this was an example described by journalist Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump may react to negative media channels , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he imag@@ ined how they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly that happened at the end of February , when someone whis@@ per@@ ing a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy Chief of the K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; the source behind a pile to be of le@@ aks &quot; at the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson had been banned from Twitter for ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he had no specific evidence , or that he utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past , and has contra@@ sted them . &quot;
dump read the article and began to in@@ quire staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; gold maker added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Rob Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the tr@@ ump . &quot;
how did this work ?
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as a Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his imp@@ ul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ors are still seeking influence . &quot;
these un@@ changeable factors make winery &apos;s mission very difficult .
Master searched for crimin@@ als get post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the people help people pray and hopes . &quot;
the police in all Europe will be tra@@ ded in this summer ( virtual ) postcards on hazardous crimin@@ als on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the de@@ crimin@@ als are not known in natur@@ alization , they are hoping to pray and pray from the population . &quot;
Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the promotion that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; adv@@ ent calendar .
the experiences would have shown that many vol@@ atile people hide from holiday dest@@ in@@ aries was called Euro@@ pol .
a total of 21 postcards covering selected crimin@@ als from 21 EU countries took place .
&quot; since 2016 , the website is www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ a , more than 2.5 million times this has been viewed . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online companions could have been arrested , at least eleven of them according to publication on the website . &quot;
trav@@ ellers negoti@@ ate over a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; million@@ aire series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute trav@@ ellers on war@@ heads , who have negotiated a field in front of their houses in front of their men &apos;s houses . &quot;
&quot; the travelers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a wealthy road of Soli@@ hull , which is called &quot; Million@@ är@@ s @-@ series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought them horses , babies , and a army of transporting them after they were first cast out in May , without being deported from the Council of excav@@ ated Gr@@ aben to prevent their accidents . &quot;
the tac@@ tical group found a gap in the defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ impe@@ ded to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants have pushed the council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; us@@ eless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said , &quot; They are going to go there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath , where they threw stones at the pass@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced to act through shame on the implementation , as he was us@@ eless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the trav@@ ellers were there in May , have moved further and are now back . &quot;
&quot; yesterday evening more arrived , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to get around in order to protect her parks in order to protect their parks . &quot;
I live on the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my discount when the Council cannot stop it once .
&quot; a local people who did not want to be called , said : &quot; it is ridic@@ ulous , we just have seen the last round of these travelers , just to be lo@@ oted by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and even saw a horse in the parking area .
&quot; a speaker for Soli@@ hull has said , &quot; &quot; We are aware of an un@@ authorized bearing on the land beyond the stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to keep them as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our control collection , it is very important that as many citizens report an anti @-@ social or criminal behavior in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof to Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof .
the house at the gates of Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel Birken@@ hof by the then ambi@@ ence of business gesellschaft mbH to 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost annually and proceeds through the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in autumn 2014 , the figures of the refugees offered in the county was offered , the hotel building was offered to the Coun@@ cill@@ or as a collective accommodation offering for controversial discussions . &quot;
&quot; the city prevented the lodging of asylum seek@@ ers through the order of a building plan to secure the territory as a hotel location . &quot;
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
but especially Freu@@ den@@ st@@ ad@@ ts Mayor of Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and was already covered by serious interested parties at that time .
he should keep right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ancers with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer , headquartered in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , has acquired the former hotel Birken@@ hof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a home of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four homes with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
&quot; two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern , and one in Bad Men &apos;s Bath . &quot;
&quot; you are named Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former hotel Birken@@ hof have been standing in front of the entrance to the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are made . &quot;
&quot; floors have been broken out , blank@@ ets partly dismant@@ led , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
until March there is still much to do .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large @-@ walk showers , the input area is designed , new window will be installed . &quot;
everything that should be &quot; beautiful &quot; later &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ erer puts it out .
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewelry . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the equipment . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t want to move at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher downtown level , st@@ resses Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms is spreading , explains the loser . &quot;
&quot; both vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he already led talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and Tourism director Michael Kr@@ ause , so Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the shows of the city are equal with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the investments in investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to define exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; external installations are also brought on front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard a large terrace , which is open from the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimi@@ stic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : U.S. Special Off@@ ers sets the Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump , special medi@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller should have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the panel recorded work , the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; wrote under appeal with the cause confi@@ ded to . &quot;
the newspaper evalu@@ ates the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded its investigations and intensi@@ fied .
the station CNN reported that there is already first charges of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between Tr@@ um@@ ps el@@ dest son and a Russian lawyer .
the US intelligence agencies acc@@ use the Kre@@ m@@ lin since country to targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller exam@@ ines whether there were agreements between Tr@@ um@@ ps campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of investigations , several men have to stand in the election campaign as adviser to the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller took more and more Tr@@ um@@ ps private and business environment among the micro@@ scope . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that Tr@@ ump himself retired to the centre and examined the accus@@ ation of whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine and decide whether the charges should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore called count of count .
&quot; mostly they are switched on , if it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always closed behind closed doors .
&quot; in addition , the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge people under E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the broad@@ caster CNN , they were already exhibited in charge of turning the encounter between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
&quot; people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement , called it in the report . &quot;
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ um@@ ps consultant and law @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ us@@ hner and his dam@@ n election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort was talking about the conversation . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the en@@ forcement show that mu@@ eller should not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that he should be necessary quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the objec@@ tion of the Gre@@ mi@@ um in the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revel@@ ations , the President on Thursday evening made a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia history is a total invention , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the topic of Democrats give the Democrats a way to feel &quot; feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about it . &quot;
&quot; his special agent T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement , he wi@@ se nothing from the en@@ forcement of a Grand Jury . &quot;
&quot; however , these work also usually emphas@@ ised in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former FBI boss James Com@@ ey told me three times that not against the President .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something changed , it was said in the explanation . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller was only used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey was fired .
&quot; because of this un@@ ra@@ wur@@ fs , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump became loud , he wants to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June prior to a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump made him an attitude of investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the President stands under a large pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; according to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the special medi@@ ator and its employees . &quot;
this dis@@ solves spec@@ ulation about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller is released .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the con@@ gresses , as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , Richard Nixon , Mu@@ eller , had a position in which he might be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republican and democratic sen@@ ators presented on Thursday , prior to which the special medi@@ ator could no longer be released . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ice berg drives in Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the West@@ ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a huge ice@@ berg of the nearly seven @-@ fold @-@ size Berlin@@ s from the Sch@@ el@@ ah has solved . &quot;
this was distributed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ Weg@@ ener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; over a trillion tonn@@ e of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometres large Kol@@ oss run now to the north and probably will need two , three years until it was melted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers , it is one of the biggest king@@ doms , the researchers have registered in the last three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
&quot; to what extent of climate change played a role in the demol@@ ition of the ice cream , research data is un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; however , since around 30 years there is a series of unusual mer@@ ges of ice cre@@ ws in the region , the U.S. Department of snow and ice ( NS@@ IDC ) writes in a fac@@ simile background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the broken column has been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ sh@@ el@@ ah so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s swim in the sea and is fed by large gl@@ ac@@ iers .
&quot; thus , it is growing steadily in the sea and breaks out regularly . &quot;
&quot; the Lar@@ sen @-@ C pi@@ er is located south of South America , almost at the top of the ant@@ ar@@ ctic peninsula . &quot;
North of this fe@@ ather was the balance of wa@@ xing and breaking off some years ago .
a complete scra@@ p is there to fall there , writes A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of things that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C sh@@ el@@ ah is in danger , because the front edge has never been re@@ tra@@ cted so far as currently . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the ice sla@@ b underneath the voltage and could melt if in a key place a piece . &quot;
&quot; the melting of gravel and ice@@ berg does not raise the sea level , as they swim along the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the scra@@ p lead to it that the gl@@ ac@@ iers are directly flowing into the sea and much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in a small dimension , writes the British research project to observation of Antar@@ c@@ tica ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI @-@ C , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C scra@@ per with almost 50 000 square kilometres is the fourth largest noise of Antar@@ c@@ tica . &quot;
&quot; in the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres . &quot;
it breaks out regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural event and we have no direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now in a dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ Le@@ ary of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the far @-@ longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he confirmed . &quot;
&quot; scientists were cont@@ ested , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ sh@@ el@@ ves will now grow again or fall back in the long term , he said , &quot; &quot; Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researcher did not lead the demol@@ ition of this gigantic ice berg on climate change , so in recent decades , however , many ice cre@@ ws of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are collapsed . &quot;
this long skir@@ t of Antar@@ c@@ tica extends to South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice area of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has dropped by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the decline in temperature increase contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees in the past 50 years , and t@@ aming the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CDU plans store at personnel
&quot; because it is becoming more difficult , to occupy free positions , the CDU calls for the CDU out of the employers association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the chal@@ k day has reached 41 new jobs in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
now 17 apprenti@@ ces have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very desired .
&quot; in this year , around 620 applications were to be recorded . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the circle still lack staff to handle the increased requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are currently 50 positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration . &quot;
&quot; the CDU would now want to take the initiative in the chal@@ k @-@ day together with the F@@ DP and U@@ WG , and to join the skilled workers in administration . &quot;
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the management aims to create a concept for recru@@ iting and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term demand on professionals , but also orient@@ ated the candidate &apos;s short@@ age . &quot;
&quot; the total concept should be oriented according to interior and outside , showing concrete measures for cross @-@ outs and include a training offensive , calling CDU , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds already after a good approach .
&quot; because the circle has to do with personnel problems , which one could not know earlier . &quot;
other cities are good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
the speech is of a real &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a high number of employees , the disease or age of age come out from the service . &quot;
&quot; highest time for actions , so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; Klaus @-@ Dieter &apos;s , president of the CDU , continues with his party even beyond the common application . &quot;
&quot; he looked un@@ long already in the chal@@ k for a fat surprise when he made public paying public in question , and the rest of the parties de@@ capit@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; people want to be reviewed , that all possibilities will be reviewed , which allow a exit from the municipal employer . &quot;
&quot; if we do not enter the short term for a satisfactory solution here , the unions should also stri@@ ve with the unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated cities . &quot;
&quot; thus , the CDU , the employees and officials seeks to pay better than it is actually the tari@@ ffs for opening service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently mandatory , increases or more money are only if one changes to a higher level that orient@@ ates itself in professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown steadily over the past years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new pro@@ stitute Protection Act . &quot;
not least by the rising number of asylum seek@@ ers . Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Thomas Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .
Italy har@@ v@@ ens the tone of NGO migrants emergency rescue
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs working for migrants in the Mediterranean Sea , warned that they do not continue to continue their operations if they do not follow the rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs have not signed a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Min@@ n@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ ampa . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ itis alert came a day after the Italian authorities were seized by a boat to the German aid organisation &quot; Youth Save , &quot; because their crew had worked effectively with traff@@ ick@@ ers in a way that facil@@ itated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the aid organisation , which is only in operation since one year , refused to express itself from the Italian state prosecutor Ambro@@ gio Carto@@ si@@ o . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of the human life is our top priority . so we are sorry that we can &apos;t operate in the search and rescue zone in the moment , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can judge all the alleg@@ ations which currently collected , but after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat from &apos; Youth R@@ ugs &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that his crew will take the sail@@ boat cru@@ ises on board , which can be delivered directly from traff@@ ick@@ ers , so that sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers can be used again so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such a meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the utter@@ ance of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of suspected of the authority of Italian coast guards , the rescue entry in the zone of humanitarian grounds , and not from any other moti@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a mainly have an Italian police officers , who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search of search and rescue sets , have previously prepared to keep the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be un@@ necessarily , but acceptable , as they would not be &quot; essential amendments or disabilities &quot; of their rescue actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize @-@ winning organization Doc@@ tors Without Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ n@@ iti said the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue measures in Italy , resulting in the last weeks that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guards and the collaboration with the local citizens of citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month for economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
A@@ scen@@ sion and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine W@@ eil@@ ers bi@@ ker , the &quot; Berlin Foreign Office &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ enheim in the Nor@@ p@@ fal@@ z for four days to enjoy Tri@@ als and S@@ ights . &quot;
three serv@@ iced guides were available to this .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley turned out to be a good starting point for tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ all of Wach@@ enheim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyard to the Micha@@ el@@ chapel above D@@ ei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there followed view@@ points , partly on door@@ men , of which one could look far beyond the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the out@@ sour@@ ced planes . &quot;
&quot; in between there , there was always longer climb , for the long tri@@ athlon . &quot;
on the second day it went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the Volks@@ fest Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again the look@@ out point to the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; tri@@ als and moderate access . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ tim@@ eter were predicted . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shelter would be welcome . &quot;
in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim the bi@@ ker had a healing Sole .
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 meters , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest from his best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundesliga Round for e @-@ sport
&quot; are the sport stars in future with computer consol@@ es , instead of strug@@ gling with wind and weather over the stadium sha@@ kes ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long been a serious branch , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - great stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high quality . &quot;
&quot; this is also recognized by the first federal government , which is increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of 2015 the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later followed the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and finally the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an E @-@ Sport department in mid @-@ July and taking two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to am@@ aze some new target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Director of Jochen R@@ öt@@ t@@ ger@@ mann .
&quot; he is sure , that there will be some clubs on this train . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , FIFA World Cup organised the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; at which the gam@@ ers of various clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Eindhoven are qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ anger also sees great potential in the e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer by Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen has meanwhile become an agency for a virtual football player .
&quot; the real football must deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people are still going to go to the stadium , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to take all the possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ athletes under contract , one could be present much more often on these markets than once in the year the federal government to Asia . &quot;
what is it exactly ?
&quot; during the e @-@ sport computer games such as &quot; League of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Counter@@ strike &quot; or &quot; Counter@@ strike FIFA at competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sport , as well as in normal sport , they are well @-@ established in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asia Pacific , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport type anyway ?
&quot; for many , the idea is safe to use . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ bi@@ ous has dealt with the question for a long time .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sport@@ s- University in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competent and many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , it requires cogn@@ itive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a rapid response ability . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should not only exercise in the console , but also exercise their body and attention to nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the fine player is a good player . &quot;
there are also problems : &quot; d@@ oping is becoming more and more a theme . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to pass through online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports were lacking . &quot;
scientists emphas@@ izes the high integral effect of the E @-@ Sports .
&quot; players are internationally active , that &apos;s like a large global family , there is no inter@@ cultural inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
a study by the management consultants Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) says the E @-@ Sport predic@@ ting a fast growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly over advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales will be at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the football Bundesliga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport &quot; is not far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice @-@ hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
many countries are already continuing .

&quot; Michelle Carter , because of the lyrics , pushing Conrad Roy to suicide . &quot;
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend by lyrics and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction behind bars and five years were suspended on par@@ ole . &quot;
Carter was sentenced to death in June due to a negli@@ gible killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is in@@ consol@@ able .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to remain free until the vocation .
&quot; she had been confron@@ ted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but its legal representatives argu@@ ed that both them and Mr Roy have suffered from psychological illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red tro@@ users and a cream @-@ coloured bl@@ ouse , Carter was with tears in the eyes , folded hands and at the bottom of the eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Roy Roy , &quot; said the State lawyer to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she took over responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ ters lawyer said that it was a &quot; horri@@ ble circum@@ stance , which they totally regre@@ t@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; Judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that her &quot; age or ri@@ pen@@ ess or even her mental disease have a significant influence on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosecutor was reading a statement by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that &quot; there is no day that I don &apos;t forget the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want it to be proud of me and how I am with everything I am with all . I try , despite all my pain , which we will bear for eternity with us , for his sisters there , is it . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys Sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she is &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; that she will never be part of the wedding of her brother or would be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this only person with whom I was together since my birth every day , is a pain that I am always kept for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a right preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit suicide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 when he was found dead by a carbon mono@@ xide pois@@ oning in a vehicle .
&quot; the case referred to national attention , after Car@@ ters revealed that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging up , hop on a building , er@@ ste@@ er yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news that she had sent in two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the eyes of his suicide , she wrote , &quot; You must do it , Conrad &quot; and &quot; Everything you must do is to switch off the generator , and you will be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter was seeking attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should take advantage of any press .
the case has dealt the legal opinion .
&quot; the few to defend Carter , Am@@ anda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co @-@ residence in Italy before being acquitted for two years ago . &quot;
&quot; MS Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not in prison . &quot;
&quot; Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of the FC Bayern &quot;
&quot; that Joshua K@@ imm@@ ich was allowed to run the Audi Cup as a captain , is no coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern tru@@ sts in the Con@@ fed Cup winner a great season - an extra motivation doesn &apos;t harm .
&quot; something was different at his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua K@@ imm@@ i immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and broad on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course there was no Philipp L@@ m and no Manuel New to see , he was added to him to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not publish it , &quot; told the Con@@ dor @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bayern @-@ Captain . &quot;
good that could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
&quot; but the sign of the coach , K@@ imm@@ i , was able to interpre@@ t it . &quot;
&quot; not the eight years old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal has been chosen as a player leader in youth games , de@@ but@@ aries and just returned from holidays , but he was chosen as a player leader . &quot;
&quot; sugar : yes , you can enjoy the most beautiful to those who want to keep the mood in the mood . &quot;
&quot; therefore , who was chosen to compete in Lah@@ m &apos;s legacy , a small extra motivation can only be used . &quot;
&quot; K@@ imm@@ i confirmed , &quot; That is what you want to do as a player : responsibility take over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old was a mini @-@ lame on the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , K@@ imm@@ i worked in this start@@ formation as the one who can also take the ru@@ dder into the hand too . &quot;
he gave instructions to direct the un@@ r@@ amped t@@ up trou@@ pe .
he had the look for the whole while many others joined themselves .
&quot; Vi@@ dal means to link his missing fitness ( fol@@ ly hardly ) ; ren@@ ato san@@ one thus to link to the performance of the Asia @-@ trip ( fol@@ te also only condition@@ ) ; and Sebastian Rud@@ y and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus do not fall negative in their first appearance in Bavaria @-@ Tri@@ ko@@ t . &quot;
but it worked perfectly well .
&quot; in addition to K@@ imm@@ ich , Rud@@ y , in front of the defense , ran both confident . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ oli @-@ storm occupied himself very often , in addition , Sü@@ le tried a few times successful in the game body . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Rud@@ y gave me that the result was &quot; not so , &quot; as we hop@@ ed for it . &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the same time .
&quot; play@@ site , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern world is still looking for new access to the game . &quot;
&quot; Rud@@ y , for example , were not one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
&quot; K@@ imm@@ i , after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements on his back of his new players . &quot;
there he heard of Sü@@ le an interesting phrase : &quot; what &apos;s going on here I have already noticed .
&quot; in Bavaria , you must simply win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the New Testament anymore . &quot;

company happy with Rheinland @-@ spicy ministers : Economics pra@@ ises Wis@@ sings Tempo
&quot; often , the relationship between the land and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still a Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this shows itself after more than one year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wiss@@ ing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and businesses from the region speak to T V @-@ inquiry by a change in economic policy - and t@@ ad@@ les at the same time the old ministry .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , President of the Association Tri@@ erer company ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; knowledge does not affect the demands of the economy , the Lem@@ ke all has blocked . &quot;
&quot; the biggest turn of the country sees Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the bridge of the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au , at the priority list of the country now . &quot;
&quot; still this year , the Ministry of Planning is hoping for planning to rise to 2021 . &quot;
&quot; a role in the country &apos;s plans also plays in Trier , which stands in the fore@@ front demand of the federal economy . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the range in operation in December 2020 , Minist@@ eri@@ on spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann says . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees there a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( I@@ HK ) , who stim@@ ulated himself as by knowledge , to increase the sales of a Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports since ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , knowledge have an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the I@@ HK . &quot;
&quot; Trier &apos;s chamber of Trier sees an additional inc@@ entive for young apprenti@@ ces , managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; fore@@ seen , a premium of 1000 Euros is intended for the given master test and 2500 Euro if graduates within ten years after the master training will become self @-@ employed . &quot;
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; as soon as planned to create road construction , Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , the main managing director of the I@@ HK Trier , says at the same time . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , the scientists want to set up mobility during the state operations are only 29 positions so far . &quot;
the I@@ HK calls for more contracts to external offices .
&quot; CDU faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ on refers to calculations on the invoice , the country investing in 2017 and 2018 more than 20 million euros less in the state of state roads . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us is also expecting a concept of the country to fix it in the region as skilled workers in the region .
sober@@ ing is further that of the previous broadband connection in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had evaluated the power supply in an I@@ HK group with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compl@@ ained about mol@@ ding Internet connections and out@@ breaks .
&quot; at the moment , ex @-@ Economic Affairs E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is at the moment out of politics and sits still in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens @-@ Group left Lem@@ ke to April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months , it already cleared the field again . &quot;
&quot; Audi is to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers are confron@@ ted with a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 35@@ 0.000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW @-@ chair said that &quot; &quot; there is more intelligent options than limit restrictions , &quot; and so it went to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - diesel vehicles to offer or limit . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; however nitrogen oxi@@ des , which em@@ it diesel engines , are considered to be carcin@@ ogenic and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers , plant to neutr@@ alize the neutr@@ alisation of diesel vehicles to install exhaust gases , also assume what makes it difficult to maintain the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignor@@ ing the powerful car companies and to ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the error of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices to regulate greenhouse gases if a car was tested , but back to normal conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged with Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former head of the ther@@ mod@@ y@@ nam@@ ics in the engine development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected from delivery and could be submitted to the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi has been involved in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi to deal a system in order to deal with emissions requirements in Europe , and a request that focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could badly strain on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer carries di@@ spro@@ por@@ tion@@ ately to profit from Volkswagen .

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ing and the laughter against sorrow
&quot; in time , Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most widely published Carto@@ on Dra@@ fts@@ man , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ ing of his figures are his trademarks . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian player is still working and working on a movie .
&quot; his message : laugh@@ ing , &quot; for there is too much sorrow in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drawing for bl@@ iss@@ ful cards - what was fru@@ str@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the most successful day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 60s , New York and Paris succeeded him breakthrough : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans in China .
&quot; always , the artists of cities inspired to be inspired . &quot;
&quot; big , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo people cav@@ ort in drawings with the shooting Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; according to the early morning , he still sits today on drawing , working daily almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Small , T @-@ Shirts , Pl@@ ush favor@@ ites and clo@@ cks are still finding a lot of spread throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has also been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with its figures . &quot;
the main character in the film &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ raffe - Mor@@ am@@ eless arbitr@@ ary animal in his drawings - which has a thou@@ sand@@ wi@@ ss@@ ler as a counter .
&quot; for the first time his figures in the 3D movie , which is to come in 2019 on the kin@@ ol@@ one wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; this is why he uses rather to the TV series , which , as its original drawings , can be released . &quot;
lavender from the Provence of climate change
&quot; he has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; because of the symptoms of d@@ rought , lavender is decl@@ ining because of the diseases transmitted by d@@ rought , scientists and farmers who try to find solutions , great heada@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute CR@@ I@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; the lavender in Provence is effective because the plant has been exposed to climate change during the past few years and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has impact on the life of lavender .
&quot; there is also a small Z@@ ik@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium , the Zwerg@@ zi@@ k@@ aden , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; lavender oil is not only lo@@ osed for vac@@ ation@@ ers , it is also very asked for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered , are a better water distribution and slow@@ ing out of the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry resistant . &quot;

the assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico
the staff of the weekly paper Ri@@ o@@ ce is usually meeting in Wed@@ nes@@ days to check out their plans for reporting on the youngest chaos in the state Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt civil servants and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shade of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
it was informed them that it is important to change their rout@@ ines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the goal of an attack with gren@@ ades , or to make it home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have three words on a panel on the front of the room &apos;s front : opponent , neutral , ally . &quot;
&quot; please ask the reporter , names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perc@@ ep@@ tions and stomach . &quot;
&quot; there are drug sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cart@@ els , a catalogue of crimin@@ als that make the chaos of Mexico . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from the violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses are more common : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Ni@@ eto , in December 2012 , there are at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and her inspir@@ ator of Ri@@ o@@ ce , who co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs . &quot;
&quot; his lack is felt deep , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Val@@ dez , which shows his middle finger with the word &quot; Justice &quot; on the facade of the Ri@@ o@@ ce @-@ building . two rep@@ orters in the thir@@ ties , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez bear T @-@ Shirts , which show its sm@@ iling face with glasses or typical Panam@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and rep@@ orters discuss their shared themes , trau@@ ma , their night@@ mar@@ es , insom@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special association was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , it has led only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists . &quot;
&quot; as with most thousands of murders , who are linked to drug retailers and organised crime each year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely tried in court . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ o@@ ce , they still exist to treat the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a though they are in@@ consol@@ able , although the terrain is still more for@@ mid@@ able . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security does not say , I@@ bar@@ ra says . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid , my time to waste this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we do not know the Why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 15 May , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away , before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was put out of two men . he was shot from his car and was shot up for 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - the &quot; twel@@ fth river . &quot; &quot;
the shooter drove away in his car and damaged it close .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adult children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but there is practically no silence on Val@@ dez &apos;s theme .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans the arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January was Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the blo@@ o@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that someone or more people are shot in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of decor@@ ating , two @-@ story maus@@ ole@@ ums for drug @-@ rounder , which are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget about a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el is control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless and despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ ce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the publication of a interviews with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of the rival flash@@ cards in the war with Gu@@ z@@ mans children . &quot;
&quot; this release may have off@@ ended the sons , assumed gang@@ members bought every copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second error was to force Val@@ dez , after the conf@@ is@@ cation of a different newspaper that had published the same story , to leave the country to its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his murder is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he had survived so long for his friends and colleagues that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced reporter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined the basis of five colleagues to the formation of Ri@@ o@@ ce and 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without the rus@@ hing poison problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with the time , the newspaper has served a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising included . &quot;
&quot; rep@@ orters loved it , hard to publish investigations without fear of c@@ ens@@ orship , and the readers were fascin@@ ated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat . &quot;
&quot; eight years after the founding of Ri@@ o@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; &quot; for their coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage during the persecution of Mexican drug history , which also led them . &quot;
he voluntarily gave himself to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue to live , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug retailers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV last October . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either the or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in view of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was like a do@@ ck@@ man , who was generous with h@@ ugs and counsel@@ ing , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always carry his hat .
&quot; he always would always sit to El Guay@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , and there will always sit on the same table . &quot;
&quot; now they ask , was his love for routine use his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to ask her own lawyers to question about how she can do their work on the best , and live in life . &quot;
&quot; they do not like to deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret start@@ - and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ awareness and self @-@ maintenance . &quot;
trust his own inst@@ ances .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ ce And@@ res Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative sm@@ ug@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; in the room where the employees of Ri@@ o@@ ce met for security training , suddenly there were no mobile phones permitted . days earlier , Spy@@ ware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a medium @-@ class district of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of polic@@ emen who described the governor for himself as not tru@@ st@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago since the rep@@ orters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug candidates are de facto control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ ce has cli@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former known Box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an ex@@ pos@@ é for the spending , which focused on the home town of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the Prosecutor , a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened , so caution was advised to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug retailers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a polit@@ ician , which ruled the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled almost all of the century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors have been accused of corruption due to highly cardiovascular cases . &quot;
&quot; in Vill@@ ar@@ real bat the reporter , to write about previous incid@@ ents in this restaurant , among them one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; made a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source about the kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; previously , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; for its slim body composition . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stick@@ ers , which prot@@ ested against the murders of journalists , because employees have become too little , as they had never expected : activists in the press name . &quot;
reporter Miriam R@@ ami@@ rez grab@@ bed a few signs and went to the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor .
Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed in the Western State of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his . &quot;
journalists became stronger throughout the country by having written in organized protests &quot; SOS Press &quot; on hearing and building sites .
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez went away in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , R@@ ami@@ rez accused the authorities to send journalists and kill them because they have said the truth . &quot;
&quot; it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government , because she &apos;s concerned that their anger has hurt their objec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico had en@@ cir@@ cled by organised crime , involved in governmental agents and a valid society . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co journ@@ alism &quot; &quot; he wrote that rep@@ orters are not only killed by drug abuse , but also on orders of politicians and security forces faced with organised crime under a ceiling . &quot;
&quot; in the past year , the media group &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico , you die because they want you to hold the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the murders have a deter@@ rent effect .
nobody forgot the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; her body was found together with a note , which was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer keyboard and head@@ set were in addition to their se@@ per@@ ated head .
some stores have chosen as the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua on the assassination of the correspon@@ dent MI@@ RO@@ S@@ LA@@ VA Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue to make El man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly addressed the drug postcard with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists from their home country or even escaped from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and searching for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ d@@ ently the photographer of Reuben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was revealed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who continue back and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risk @-@ rich decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be poets , gives knowledge that drug retailers are sc@@ ared him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I was rep@@ orters , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ ce were sitting on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum@@ s up . &quot;
a range of shooting shops with band@@ ab@@ dic@@ als and security forces near the seaside resort of Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war continues to escal@@ ate as promised by a series of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the Bord@@ st@@ kan@@ te , they have published news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ ce via mobile . &quot;
the front page had to be changed on the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens he@@ ats near to - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the polic@@ emen , who kept guard to see if they were in read@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; among the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for quite Sin@@ alo@@ a , the employee of Ri@@ o@@ ce followed his traces . &quot;
&quot; as you can only think about it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day , on which Javier has been murdered , the practition@@ er was asked for me to send them to the streets . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ouflage to avoid his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , even though a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ oc@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been received so well that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa , Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even realize that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said they could have had anything from a &quot; un@@ quiet past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the preserved mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs , which ever was found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs copies of the world . &quot;
fossil is a newly discovered type of no@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous period between 110 million and 112 million years .
&quot; his incredibly well @-@ maintained state has to describe it as &quot; truly remarkable , &quot; bl@@ oss@@ essed it &quot;
&quot; according to reports from National Ge@@ ographic , the mo@@ red plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res is the best preserved F@@ ossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Shawn Funk , when he was located on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met on something , which appeared from the surrounding rock at the Plat@@ ze , and decided to look closer . &quot;
this fossil was discovered by him in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) . &quot;
&quot; after all these hard work , the ready result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you &apos;re only blind with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this vegetable @-@ e@@ aters , although it is covered with a arm@@ or and resem@@ bles a wall @-@ changing shell , probably threatened by flesh e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the strong red din@@ osau@@ rs used a red and white cam@@ ouflage to hide , and used a par@@ atro@@ ss that is known as counter@@ att@@ ing , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this could have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and to ev@@ ade his enemies , experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now shown in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli following the museum techn@@ ician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of she@@ ds and arm@@ aments about his body .
&quot; they discovered the sha@@ dy , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creation was dar@@ ker than its base . &quot;
&quot; although the Con@@ ter@@ rier is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising because the size of Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure through flesh e@@ aters din@@ osau@@ rs , evolution of con@@ frontation with the con@@ frontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter blo@@ oming - do you think of Re@@ he , Zeb@@ ras , or gir@@ dle - are much smaller and inj@@ uri@@ ous than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong pre@@ dat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs ro@@ ls of the C@@ ret@@ ace@@ ous have to have been &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r al bay was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal on notes about his life , including its preserved Dar@@ min@@ hal@@ tes to find out what it eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ rs , when he died , fell into a river and sank into the sea , where he sank on the back to the sea ground . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alberta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with a cl@@ ums@@ y skin , but also remains in three dimensions and ret@@ ains the original form of the beast , &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to recon@@ struct it . if you &apos;re only a little with the eyes of Sch@@ iel@@ en , you could almost believe that he is at bed@@ time . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time when giant Ther@@ op@@ oden , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , had gone through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Ty@@ ran@@ nos@@ aurus Rex , lived millions years after Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the mo@@ red din@@ osau@@ rs was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ y ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Acro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest insights in the journal Current Biology appear , believe that Bo@@ real@@ op@@ el@@ ta has been ens@@ lav@@ ed after death in the sea and mu@@ til@@ ated in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creation was found by Shawn Funk , when he was located on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ c@@ or Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Murray in the North of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the uphol@@ stered din@@ osau@@ rs of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle up to hips . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were approximately 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long points which ra@@ ced from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the mo@@ red plant car@@ ni@@ vo@@ res was sha@@ ken by Western Canada , until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater fishing of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
&quot; the remains of this special specimen is so well preserved , that the skin fe@@ asts still cover hol@@ low tank plates along the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preser@@ vation is as rare as a win in the l@@ otto . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more conf@@ using it . &quot;
remains of the skin still cover the hol@@ low @-@ hol@@ low tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot lies on his side , his five fingers crossed up above . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : Mass@@ enk@@ ar@@ amb@@ ol@@ age on A8 : many injured
hot accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass b@@ amb@@ ol@@ age .
there are numerous injured , miles long stro@@ kes - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the late Thursday morning of Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A8 ) , approximately 20 people have been hurt in the late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information of the police , at 17.00 o &apos;clock there were between the connection of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a storm of almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , in@@ clin@@ ched . &quot;
there were no information about the exact number of publishers in the previous year .
&quot; it takes effect for mild to moderate injuries , said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
a big offer of rescue cars was at the accident site .
the A8 was completely closed towards Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long retreat formed . &quot;
&quot; like an AZ reporter , it also came on the opposite way to massive disability - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire brig@@ ade took the mark of the vehicle &apos;s len@@ ders that now have a sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 o &apos;clock the second accident oc@@ cured on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
it was a coll@@ ision between a car park and a car had come .
a b@@ ail@@ out helicopter was on the way to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everybody has experienced once : nothing , sitting in the train and sleeps . &quot;
&quot; or it is deep@@ ens in his work , and has just a gen@@ ious thoughts . &quot;
and then : buffer .
does the Schaff@@ ner come and we@@ ars a gra@@ ft or ri@@ ps the suspension in the middle of the workflow .
driving card control .
but times of inter@@ ru@@ ptions are soon passed .
the Deutsche Bahn test@@ ers currently testing the inv@@ it@@ less ticket inspection .
&quot; it is confirmed by mobile phone , that one has taken his place , and thus evalu@@ ates the ticket . &quot;
currently a test operation running on two routes .
&quot; when the offer comes , we are extending it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available to many other traffic routes in Germany at the beginning of the next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the train , without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to use the use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have booked an online ticket - whatever passengers do already .
&quot; it also has to be purchased via the App of the Rail , DB Navigator , which is the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and last one needs a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; works like that : you get up to the train , calling its ticket under &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , then a button for the electronic de@@ valuation will be released . &quot;
&quot; the train conductor will receive a message for their mobile devices , that Fahr@@ g@@ ast X is located in the train and taken the booked seat R@@ Y . &quot;
&quot; the train conductor is at rank Y , and he knows that there is already a passenger with already @-@ made online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue working , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customers , one for the railway - what again the passenger should use . &quot;
&quot; if you want to relax without a ticket inspection , check out in the DB Navigator for itself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train of personal &quot; , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Management Board of DB correspondence . &quot;
second Plus : &quot; and our staff have more time than today to enter the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who runs often , knows that in addition to del@@ ays and missed trains the ticket controls belong to the greatest stum@@ bling . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , however , one of the participants not all documents need to be paid for the evaluation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or otherwise a document that you have to indicate .
&quot; the consequence are endless discussions between train conductor and driving capacity , which leads to bad mood in the event , and delay in control of your own tickets and the Schaff@@ ner takes the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
still a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and also only on the links ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional train numbers on the same circuit are not available yet .
how an activist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Britt@@ any Fer@@ rell was sha@@ ken up to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after having arrived in New York City , sitting in St. Louis Geb@@ or@@ ene was sitting on the bed of an Air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment , which they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled upon a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police just killed an 18 year old child , and it &apos;s still on the street , &quot; it called it . &quot;
&quot; confused when nobody had posted detailed information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah is constantly praying on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; rap@@ es@@ eed from St. Louis &apos;s territory was the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year old man who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . , killed live . &quot;
post@@ oper@@ able a picture of Brown &apos;s le@@ w@@ alled body that was stretched out on the road and would stay there four hours .
&quot; this is wild , &quot; I thought fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she started her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive on the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police and fol@@ ks , cried out , and by a man who claimed to be a sign with the slogan : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ ons police killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she observed a live feed , where a polic@@ eman stood before a group of demonstr@@ ators with a rebellious dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , a different polic@@ eman sho@@ ok his ri@@ fle and cried : &quot; I will all kill you ... &quot;
&quot; this is not custom@@ ary , &quot; Fer@@ rell was remin@@ ded of their testimony . &quot;
&quot; this is not the kind of murder that we have gotten used to us , which we can call typical . &quot;
at this moment I felt ch@@ ills .
&quot; I was angry and wept . &quot;
&quot; she bu@@ ck a return flight , and went home the next day . &quot;
after the landing at 23 pm she repeated her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary cinema , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinemas from the 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of the perspective of men who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rell with her daughter who brought a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a discussion that they had countless times before this morning &quot; over the black experience and the black condition . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that , what they believe ? &quot; they remembered what she said . &quot;
we now go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police have killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right .
&quot; I could not take them away , &quot; &quot; Fer@@ rell said later . &quot;
what is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
you have to know it and see it in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not just acti@@ vism and organization , but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the lucky thing to give her a experience in which she personally had no ec@@ lat@@ ant rac@@ ism , she is no different to the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I feel the feeling , I would prove you a bad service to keep them far from it . &quot;
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police station , which was waiting for the activists on the possible non @-@ charge of Chief Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there was Fer@@ rell and her daughter , connected with a local business@@ man , made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags before and helped them to carry out protest@@ ers .
slowly began creating a new species of acti@@ vism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s form .
&quot; after 9 August , my share of acti@@ vism acquired , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority student N@@ ur@@ ses Association , focusing on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in the organisation .
it has come all . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the film &apos;s co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to document &quot; document &quot; what happened . &quot;
a question was Fer@@ rell : &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ?
&quot; this sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often of white @-@ in @-@ a community benef@@ ited from pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview : &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , grew up and raised their voices , and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis worked together with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , who is known for its acti@@ vism around death . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought to Fer@@ rell &apos;s project , along with six other loc@@ als followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after bro@@ w flies . &quot;
&quot; this documentary isn &apos;t someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . we speak , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are depicted , for so I will be depicted . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to concentrate on Fer@@ rell@@ s experience - to show that it concerns itself &quot; not about a Messiah leader , but for a community that comes together , &quot; &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film . &quot;
&quot; consequently , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of fer@@ rell@@ s life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
&quot; but I understood that there must be certain injuries at this work , and in the realization of black people . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Fer@@ rell@@ ing &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Li@@ ves Movement . &quot;
two of the three founder of the movement that were co@@ ined after the kill@@ ings of the black Teen@@ agers Tra@@ y@@ by Martin in 2012 to identify the film &quot; Black@@ liv@@ es@@ mat@@ ter &quot; in social media identify themselves as gay .
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and therefore we are fighting with different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not a sub@@ jection type of action , &quot; chosen by Fer@@ rell on their identity as a heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sho@@ ok these energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s no coincidence , although it was at the front of the front , because with a life at these cru@@ ises than a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on has long disappeared , but the r@@ att@@ ain@@ able connections between the church and the police continue . &quot;
Fer@@ rell is on par@@ ole two ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the soci@@ opolit@@ ical atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos .
&quot; nevertheless she compl@@ ained to a vocals and she feels committed to this memory , since then she went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on three years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is our duty to fight for our freedom . &quot;
it is our duty to win .
we must love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size bet &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit @-@ gallery moves the people , although they are not yet built yet . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre on the southern zone of the pedestrian zone has been ob@@ sol@@ ete since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents .
cold the topic is hardly any one .
on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg &quot; the theme will be discussed .
&quot; while the one to the Bit Gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; ) or &quot; That would be real &quot; ( Nicole rock@@ est ) , comes from the other side : &quot; don &apos;t need a man &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etting ) or quite simple : &quot; size bet ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the advoc@@ ates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city , of which also the rest of the business take advantage , fear the opponent that cur@@ d the pedestrian zone . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is being planned on the premises in which the farmer &apos;s market stands , in which 13 direct mark@@ eters are offering their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of construction work , the conclusion is concluded . &quot;
the Gallery M@@ acher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sitting outside .
Simone Room : &quot; we &apos;ve been buying almost weekly in the farms market for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land to come back very much . &quot;
we discovered the but@@ cher for us too .
we would like to wish that while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also . &quot;
&quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; if direct mark@@ eters in a market hall in the gallery starts to rent at the height of the rent .
&quot; the new project should probably be low , however . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what is the most shopping mall in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dr@@ ens or supermarkets : I find it superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is enough in our city .
but one sees how many shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a regular weekly market , it is the more important that at least the Mark@@ thalle remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered is fresh , mostly offered by the producer and is ob@@ tru@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; as you see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only from larger companies , because the dor@@ man@@ ers are often not portable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions there is almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the farms market during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ de@@ KA would be the solution - even in duration , if the bit @-@ gallery is actually coming sometime . &quot;
or does it already manage the Al@@ pen@@ st bit @-@ gallery before exp@@ els all the shops of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that &apos;s just not working .
&quot; and shopping centre , which is empty , nobody needs no one . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
but there is no room for a farmer &apos;s market thanks to the mad people - as I find - sens@@ less building projects in Bit@@ burg no more space .
&quot; when the peas@@ ant hall is cap@@ tive , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the center of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown that almost im@@ perc@@ ep@@ tible - that depend on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ far and Haar@@ lem who were sent by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from the Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former Intelligence Analy@@ tic@@ ancer had served a 35 @-@ year sentence after having publicly acknowledged diplomatic news about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which opened on 2 August , is A Bec@@ oming Res@@ em@@ bl@@ ance ( A matching simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline was transformed into technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gression and breaking dis@@ sid@@ y , whose conviction of Barack Obama was only three days later in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been created by the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that could look from Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , as someone can be interpreted with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many wise men , how they can be interpreted and the inher@@ ent determin@@ ism of these inter@@ pret@@ ations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Bradley Edward , but has been openly spoken about the identification as a woman in 2013 , including six violations of the Act , Computer and theft . &quot;
&quot; by the jail her picture was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gra@@ ined , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is deliberately sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and a plat@@ in blonde bar@@ ber bears - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Vis@@ ions &apos; . &quot;
&quot; this is produced by the artist portraits of foreigners from for@@ en@@ ish arti@@ facts such as cig@@ ars and che@@ wing gum , extra@@ cting the DNA from the tr@@ ash to create a picture of how these people could look like . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they led a interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg on a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time , and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were sent to un@@ equal letters , which were replaced by several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated comic strip &quot; Supp@@ ressed images , &quot; which would be predic@@ t a future in which the president &apos;s chel@@ ated judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome type of happy gathering re@@ union . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and Star@@ kes , da Donald Tr@@ ump brings a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government and against trans@@ gender troops to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to fix the rigid columns , which he should fix . &quot;
&quot; as De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg after the wei@@ rd timing of all these things was asked , she said that &quot; things happen for a specific reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the art gallery , Mann@@ ing called for Mann@@ ing with its superior signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is marked with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic breaking ceremony , whose foundation have been sex , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
on the opposite wall is their mit@@ ochondri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ ing of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil .
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nu@@ cle@@ ot@@ ide after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia of the artist ) , as aston@@ ish@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how sub@@ jective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ Nov@@ elle . &quot;
&quot; she shows Mann@@ ing , as it appears with a free cour@@ ty@@ on in the hand from the disciplines of the United States as King Kong . &quot;
&quot; when they ch@@ ill your speech in cold , then they have won . &quot;
&quot; so , never mind the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who sal@@ uted from Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps , when I talk about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally , as it was predic@@ tive in the comic book - but if they should do it , then she will be greeted in the middle of the space of the masks , who joined forces like hor@@ des of protest@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; it was also targeted as it was all written in the exhibition until the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , &quot; Mann@@ ings St@@ ature ) , where their genetic h@@ lin@@ ens were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past , I had on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , forming to Chelsea , like the movement , which was also behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing
&quot; a nationwide man @-@ hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , which had been sought after a man in a luxury apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham L@@ ath@@ em ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) warran@@ ts for murder because of its alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ enton H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , the acts of the District Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several styles . &quot;
a local warning system published by the Chicago police authority said that Lei@@ che was discovered on July 27 .
&quot; officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead on the site of the event for dead , and det@@ ective investig@@ ating the stal@@ ks as murder , while the police actively campa@@ ig@@ ning for the two susp@@ ects , said officials . &quot;
L@@ ath@@ em has been an extraordinary professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ bage , vice president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that L@@ ath@@ em had been in lau@@ ur@@ k and had been excluded from the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal matter which is examined by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University co @-@ operates at this study , &quot; said Cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a spokes@@ man from the University and Staff College , said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , and ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way . &quot;
&quot; the statement added , that War@@ r@@ ens were sho@@ cked and want to be sho@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi , said he demands the susp@@ ects to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police has an idea of her residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; says Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help finding the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 is something happening . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi said , it is un@@ clear whether the incident occurred on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that L@@ ath@@ em and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gug@@ li@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the Grand Plaza management team showed a statement to the inhabitants : &quot; &quot; the police currently works at the time axis and the background of the victim , and explo@@ res a variety of moti@@ fs , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - the Russian Vice @-@ President Mut@@ ko
the Russian Vice @-@ President Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this regard ; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday .
&quot; the PM S commented on the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the re@@ en@@ forcement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and has recently been published on the organisation &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could be concerned for Russia occasion . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the list of criteria , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping authorities accepted the reported findings by the Canadian attor@@ ney Richard McLaren to alleged government sponsored D@@ op@@ ings in Russian sports . &quot;
in terms of the matter Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we conduct the investigation because our anti @-@ d@@ oping system has collapsed an error .
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ k@@ os words agreed with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales station R@@ sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ d@@ oping organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report , &quot; Sm@@ ir@@ no@@ v added . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the WA@@ DA d@@ oping sc@@ and@@ als from the implementation of D@@ oping control in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was permitted to plan and coordin@@ ate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( Ukrain ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to the headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA @-@ Director Olivier Nig@@ gl@@ i declared that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA have moved &quot; into the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;

&quot; start @-@ ups that will help your business , not to become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy rescue wanted to measure your staff in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up in your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the p@@ olls did not work .
&quot; responses were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - dec@@ eit@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised An@@ on@@ ym@@ ity , some workers mour@@ ned the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objec@@ tivity , &quot; &quot; Rede@@ mption , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed . &quot;
it was called people from outside to help .
&quot; a new race of human resources start @-@ ups is at Wach@@ ter , to help companies find out how their employees feel . &quot;
&quot; through the creation and licensing of software , which has the specific purpose of measurement of employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , Special groups and demo@@ graphic groups , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ n will allow employees to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for the persecution of their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analy@@ tics tools are used to measure employees involvement . &quot;
&quot; salvation said that they think of a better insight into what your employees think and , in the three years , won with g@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the s@@ nap @-@ surveys and p@@ olls of certain teams , it provides a heat map of the company , which shows a look , which units have the most complaints and which managers are low state results - so that you can drill it , why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture have to remain , so that you do not have the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als , which describes a former employee of har@@ ass@@ ment , in which those who have spoken were punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups , such as G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , Regulation and Compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion value by 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Denver , Colorado , start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and identify bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the middle of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ ts has almost 600 clients , including air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tesla . &quot;
u@@ ber recently registered as a client .
&quot; as G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ ting Company lets you send tail@@ or @-@ tail@@ or @-@ tail@@ or @-@ tail@@ or @-@ Re@@ quest to collect real time and watch the warmth cards of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line with which people can report bad behavior .
&quot; and when the main managing director is involved , complaints to the Supervisory Board move directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the public opinion has recorded the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and managing director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his employees is badly treated or un@@ ethical , it may experience co@@ stly consequences by consumers @-@ boy@@ cott , workers of workers and complaints , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25.000 employees and more than 500 locations , conver@@ ts for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have a simple way to get their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier when an employee wished to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company , a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often an in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation and un@@ comfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now when the company convert Conver@@ ts , problems , who were sitting in offices in cities or countries , were hidden , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ fair practices , were identified and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holi@@ stic , 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management Group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders in front of employment , lit@@ igation . &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen broke down due to ethical violations by the Enron sc@@ andal broke Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; Social Media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that they couldn &apos;t prevent her dirty clothes online . &quot;
&quot; prior to using technology to monitor the ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and strain the company with recur@@ ring fees for use of their products . &quot;
it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of venture Capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; convertible received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the entire capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November of Bess@@ emer Venture Partners and earned his entire funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , in view of the connected nature of businesses , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees expect more than previously . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only w@@ agers . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you are accepted and estimated that you give your time a company with a positive mission .
&quot; when people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more strongly committed to make this business successfully , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Benef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In that both Conver@@ ts and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach r@@ end@@ ites if their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if analy@@ tics tools promise third promise to raise commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee involvement in the experts of the workplace culture is important .
&quot; but the data are us@@ eless , if the administrator of a company does not take action . &quot;
&quot; in fact , if a company asks employees to your feedback , it may have expect@@ ation to anticip@@ ate that change is on its way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or at all , this dis@@ appointments and employees cannot motiv@@ ate it . &quot;
&quot; if you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you have to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen the company very on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow the staff , &quot; Don &apos;t you really hear me ? &quot;
do you care about that ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about that , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Madison Reed , who is now through the monthly employee p@@ olls , was able to run measures on the same day if a problem is reported on G@@ lin@@ t , to deliver . &quot;
&quot; according to the review of the feedback of fru@@ str@@ ated employees , it was able to organize and improve the quality of communication , capable of organizing several teams within the company and to add a communication training to tackle the problems . &quot;
&quot; with Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights over the staff , and it hopes for a long run , this leads to a better binding of workers in a sector that is well @-@ known for high sales . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose man , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose companies . &quot;
N@@ CAA removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the Bru@@ ins
&quot; it goes on 23 o &apos;clock , when a lot U@@ CL@@ A @-@ Foot@@ ball players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team enter@@ tain@@ ed on campus . &quot;
some have moved their tri@@ cot parts and show the back full of silence from the first day of the workout camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these un@@ usually minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are inscri@@ bed to the summer courses are returning after the end of the three @-@ hour exercise before they return to the Aqu@@ arian Football Center in the next morning at 6 : 30 pm .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real t@@ ret@@ mill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; N@@ CAA elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has extended its days in fact - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings from U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 are to be justified in order to meet the players already completed . &quot;
&quot; the compromise is gone out of the two days , more than one day , to which the brood in the beginning of the camp is post@@ pon@@ ed almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
you should hold 18 exercises during the course of August . 20 before the start of the formal preparations for the start of Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the control change of N@@ CAA , even if they add a further point in the country &apos;s versatile it@@ iner@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous burden on three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just passed it , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come up to Saturday and we will have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end its practices as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated , as soon as the camp is termin@@ ated in its fields of a adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of the up@@ scale class that had already been carried out with foot@@ ball@@ ements , which will be no light task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that it could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our safety , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it &apos;s not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people will rent there a room and then choose to record a practice . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ and from an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t make too big concerns about this .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts in combat against counter@@ feit messages
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counter@@ feit detection of third parties and their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday said . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on his website , that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible counter@@ feit detection and to indicate them on fac@@ simile verification of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called F@@ ake news , many of which believe that they also have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem is also become a major political topic in Europe , with the French elec@@ torate being flooded in May with false stories , and Germany supported a plan to be punished by the social media networks as soon as they did not succeed to eliminate h@@ ass@@ orted mail@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that , in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the knowledge which stories of fac@@ simile verification of third parties , people want more context to meet what they read and share , &quot; said Sara Su , Product manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; it added that Facebook continues to test his feature to the &quot; &quot; associated article &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce wrong messages . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
in his younger past the little Scot@@ ney Castle was in a sque@@ eze @-@ music video and was for Margaret Th@@ at@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ he and 1980 @-@ s a can@@ op@@ hole .
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history in the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now available for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mop@@ ed Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a pre@@ ference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this ep@@ ist@@ le in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scot@@ ney . every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , which is based on an archive : he wrote 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library , which he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b printing on the page of a letter that was written by a double assistant in the 1700 @-@ s , he says for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; that is his Dau@@ men@@ ue Print !
&quot; and letters always smell like smoke , because at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives for 300 years later , the smell has an effect as it would be even involved . &quot;
&quot; Ah , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest , &quot; ) it seems all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ dos spent his days to explore the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , watch the archives and have spent many treasures and curi@@ os@@ ities of the castle , such as the mon@@ ic hy@@ ena of walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle , and spoke with Land@@ scape , gar@@ dener and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , in the night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only full access in 2006 than the last time I , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which arist@@ oc@@ rats said &quot; Oh , throw it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English Emp@@ ires , cards , who pose what it had : &quot; one could mean that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to have fought for the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go for his walk ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to put on a wider basis into the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who is re@@ building the newly built castle in order to close the peas@@ ant back from 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a pro@@ ar which appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kn@@ igh@@ tly Family &apos; of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peas@@ ant began in this field and I thought , a rebellion was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are linked together ? &quot;
other stories have been dr@@ oted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; that tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ rons that the Dar@@ rell &apos;s family hidden seven years during the English Reformation .
&quot; or &apos; The Sm@@ ug@@ gler &apos; , in which the sm@@ ug@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell portra@@ yed out of the 18th century by filling his own funeral by filled a sar@@ g of stones ( a discovery that was first dug later ) when his sar@@ g was dug out . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ rell@@ s are Rhodes &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the Lor@@ ds seemed to be certain g@@ aun@@ er , always doing debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rell &apos;s men extingu@@ ish their debt crises by giving rich old women - I imagine it as a he@@ ap well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to recru@@ it land@@ locked . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his deployment in the castle , Rhodes remained in search of other unique cri@@ b experiences &quot;
&quot; he has brought a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about El@@ kan@@ än@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium on the early 20th century , which has since been demanded by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; Oh , now I have to get ready with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : 300 years old Mari@@ ni@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the unveil@@ ing of the 301 @-@ year @-@ old Mari@@ chapel in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f started their campaign to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rundschau of Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team will hold Nelson Art@@ z the logo and the slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , it will be the cli@@ max of the campaign to be a celebration on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of the action since yesterday on posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think of course ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; write them on their un@@ locking website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are the firm conviction that we know as a bath Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens to know the beauty and attraction of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; the action it &apos;s more than &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan &quot; , &quot; it &apos;s further . &quot;
&quot; it is true to form@@ ulate a universal promise , one that gives the city a distinctive sole . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in the competition with other municipalities . &quot;
the city Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f lets the town of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f will cost their new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military forces in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) advis@@ es over pension and convey@@ ors in the officer of the officer . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was not held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister &apos;s Office . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the government , the five Vice Premier@@ s , as well as the ministers of Defense , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs . &quot;
so the civilians were in the Y@@ as in the crowd .
the government moves the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; according to Chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , he remains in office but com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy were removed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , head of head fired Erdo@@ gan 169 of 326 Gener@@ als and Ad@@ mir@@ th . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the move of exile @-@ Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen , who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire trial . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people , who have been involved in the coup attempt , has been negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of God as a &quot; Wor@@ ker , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have the army hold on ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article with the title &quot; Un@@ be@@ hagen in the military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; of the army which mani@@ f@@ ests itself among others in raising the head@@ tu@@ b@@ ots for Sol@@ dier , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the big pur@@ se in the army and security forces go further . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan sent another 73@@ 95 state operators , including 230@@ 3 police officers and 546 soldiers . &quot;
&quot; in this case , it seemed to be t@@ amed by Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
gener@@ als were older than the real masters of the country .
in three times it ra@@ ges on their role as gu@@ ardi@@ ans of the world@@ ly state order .
&quot; following his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan run the power of the military step by step , not least in appeal to the reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan run targeted a Islam@@ ization of the forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Voc@@ al Europe , &quot; a nam@@ ing officer accused of asylum seek@@ ers who sought persecution abroad , Turkish army will be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ af@@ ists in a few years . &quot;
&quot; as a result , NATO could not let NATO so cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there are doubts in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational abilities were &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; it will give a new US entry plan to change the rules of Green Card , President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited from the media . &quot;
&quot; it looks ahead to lower the leg@@ al immigrants on 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for the refund of visa for a temporary work permit and limitations for family @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for the tax@@ pay@@ ers , and will do this by the US will change the way as to citizens from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains migration and replace the present system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who have English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and knowledge that our economy will benefit , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump , cited from American media . &quot;
Ministry wants tour for the transportation shuttle
&quot; again , over the past few months past the future of the racing fac@@ tor@@ ship , it &apos;s supposed to go very quickly . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it should be built at the mar@@ o@@ des circuit , which travels to the tourist office . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the transport system in the long term , according to data from the Ministry of Transport , construction work will begin in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and press the track Il@@ men@@ au race platform , the country is particularly important for the tourism important link , &quot; stated road Secretary Klaus S@@ ühl on Friday in Erfurt . &quot;
the costs for the over@@ h@@ aul of the track was about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country takes 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , based on which the Shuttle will also be ordered in the future of the country , will definitely be matched , explained S@@ ühl . &quot;
the Ministry and the South @-@ ür@@ cher is as operator of the technical details .
&quot; thus , the road@@ map , the vehicles , and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ ühl . &quot;
the planned contract between the Ministry and the Rail Company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so that the Race Shuttle should be ordered for regular service on December 2017 .
the Race Shuttle is a popular train connection between the train stations Il@@ men@@ au and the race platform .
&quot; during the last months , the course of a pilot company has been tested , whether the distance of sufficient lot of people is used to order them regular in the future . &quot;
the track is also in parts very di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought that it can &apos;t be crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible mechanics ) ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Shar@@ key , retired professor of robot@@ ics and artificial intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the ey@@ epi@@ ece of the robot , its form of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; people make themselves funny , but the companies deliver every lot of it , and we will still get much more common , &quot; said Mr Shar@@ key at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware of human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can custom@@ ize his robot , according to its convic@@ tions , &quot; and thereby select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of ni@@ p@@ ples up to the type or the colour of its finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but there &apos;s more wor@@ r@@ ying , since many robots possess the &quot; personalities &quot; that will make a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ u@@ ppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ Bot@@ ix robot allows for example to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties , which they look appe@@ aling as for example . &quot;
&quot; and then there &apos;s the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ Robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of rel@@ ent@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with a &quot; advent@@ u@@ rous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; war@@ ms the site of True Compan@@ ion . &quot;
&quot; so what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just as real people ! &quot;
she may be tired to be fixed on conversation or she can be &quot; in mood . &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ ris@@ ome aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the lower female properties , the attraction on rape , if one step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resi@@ sting ) Far@@ rah is wor@@ ris@@ ome one most . &quot;
&quot; true to his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy , with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fet@@ ish or simply just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their emergence and its increasing refin@@ ement prove something dark and deep in our culture , on a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes as an optional addition to sex with sub@@ jection . &quot;
&quot; most men do not have sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , however , they remain preliminary on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what le@@ ak@@ eth out of the boundary , can be in terms of the spirit of time , in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
&quot; and many people are not strange or ins@@ ulting , until the free market gives permission . &quot;
&quot; there is a certain conclusion that this highly developed Sex robot in a time immer@@ se , in which the women &apos;s rights are threatened with women in which there are a pre@@ sidents in which the White House gives a pre@@ sidents to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most horri@@ ble aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s &apos; T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the more closed body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but as realistic this vision . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a jump , but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump . &quot;
&quot; the goal behind these sex robots , there is a physical simil@@ arity to actual women so realistic as possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star propor@@ tions ) . &quot;
&quot; her builder , they want to feel human , that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body . &quot;
&quot; but , on the point , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; robots represent no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate from their companion or just go away .
&quot; they have no medi@@ ation or background history , nothing , what is suggest@@ ing on independence or anything that might distur@@ b the imagination of total sub@@ jection . &quot;
expressed in other words : they are counter@@ part slaves .
or to express it in the words of 2017 : maid service
tr@@ um@@ ps great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney an ep@@ it@@ ome of the healthy human being
&quot; it has become a binary counter of the tr@@ ump era , that the political column , which have the US voters , have also divided families in small formats . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and harvest festival , there was newspapers in the USA newspapers with advice about how to circum@@ vent with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ elected relatives . &quot;
we are all amazed to make our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tr@@ um@@ ps , Famili@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I consider this because my cousin , a left @-@ directed poet , who lives in Chicago , and has long been dealing with the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans in our family to visit me this week in New York . &quot;
she rec@@ alled me that the unit can have a powerful effect against a joint enemy .
&quot; Tr@@ ump in the White House is everyone who knows them , including the republi@@ can relationship , with which she had fought for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left hand was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the resulting effect of his presidency has the force to push all of us to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ us@@ eless opportunity that we will no longer stop us from a day . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a long @-@ term long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump rep@@ ublic@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes , &quot; which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of confusion . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia to Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ ian version of the back , the dog on the car roof , which saw 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax returns ) - which occurs both in comparison to Tr@@ ump in fact a very mild off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an un@@ measur@@ able improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to Car@@ us@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the Car@@ us@@ eck of the New York parking department , and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enorm@@ ously large , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinders - all c@@ low@@ ns are cris@@ p and the animals rotate to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ mer@@ ing music con@@ veys this in strange manner . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ ap@@ point : the views of high buildings will become old , the Sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not be righteous . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park @-@ Kar@@ us@@ sel is still another magical experience since there are two two @-@ year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women to go on it and have a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked him . &quot;
on the other hand I was forced to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same as the option to buy the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ ing of what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also exercises pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman at the department store stood exc@@ el@@ ingly , while tired of the experience tired of having my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us with chest pain from prison to the hospital
Pist@@ ori@@ us left the jail for a hospital visit for the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cut@@ itten on his joints , which he suffered from prison authorities according to a fall in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convicted of murder of the appeal &apos;s attor@@ neys for murder .
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of the Valentine &apos;s early hours in 2013 , taking them several times by a door of the toil@@ et@@ aker in Pre@@ toria in Pre@@ toria . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a no@@ c@@ tur@@ ally int@@ ru@@ der that hid himself in the cabin .
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to en@@ rol this time against the six @-@ year sentence from Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say , she was sigh@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the national law en@@ forcement authority said that it could rise to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objec@@ tion could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us is a danger that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as Bauer Arnold is a strange egg finds
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four districts of feeding and Ep@@ is@@ ho@@ fen was dischar@@ ged into the school and in the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the pupils go to school , four at the secondary school . &quot;
school manager Angel@@ ika S@@ itte welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the Bi@@ es@@ ental hospital in Ep@@ is@@ ho@@ fen .
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ des chose a young eag@@ les , which grows in the chicken yard , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the m@@ lower Sch@@ ar introduced a musical with the title &quot; The Adler in the chicken yard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bauer Arnold took a strange egg , and left it from his chicken . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken shed , a small eag@@ les came out . &quot;
&quot; however , the hope of making a chicken sh@@ atter@@ ed , the eag@@ les spread its wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the study of Y@@ v@@ onne Frank a chicken . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens dancing with the young go@@ ck@@ les , the cylinders , around the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Adler stand for integration , MEP Angel@@ ika S@@ itte said . &quot;
&quot; the young was different from the other young animals ( ch@@ icks ) , but belonged . &quot;
but he never will be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
they wish every fourth shop that he feels in his new school .
&quot; there followed thank you to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Mu@@ eller , who starts up again at school cr@@ abs , and the parents represented . &quot;
&quot; the cooking time is now over , &quot; said class teacher Sophia Schumacher . &quot;
they leave their students only very un@@ skilled at two years because it was a really great time .
&quot; finally , it has to leave on the vier@@ t@@ kl@@ ä@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students can play a song from summer time and summer time . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight first samples are already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for Il@@ legal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians detained for illegal Camp@@ ings in Greece , cited by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegal people , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while currently an investigation is underway . &quot;

software update for diesel vehicles : what you need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?
the most important questions and answers in an overview .
&quot; at the diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group offered software updates for around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve emissions of emissions of Euro 5 and some Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or bad are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives a assessment :
is the new action oblig@@ atory ?
&quot; no , the negotiated software updates are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates are valid only for vehicles that have been translated into ECSC , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
its retro@@ fitting has ordered the Federal Office of the Federal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; manufacturers have announced an enormous implementation in the coming months , but still no exact date . &quot;
Daimler announced to re@@ write every person affected .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , I will be done in their framework . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fit be prevented overall ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
&quot; the curtains from the commitment of the manufacturer , as well as of political pressure . &quot;
&quot; because we have seen , voluntarily negoti@@ ate the car manufacturers at the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long shall the update last ?
the retro@@ fitting itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming may be to get an appointment .
&quot; what are motor@@ ists that do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE is advis@@ able to wait .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is now a massive reduction of Euro @-@ 4 cars ?
the ACE will be afraid of that .
but even in the regions where drivers are dro@@ pping .
&quot; in rural space , there is no loss for older diesel so far . &quot;
the ACE is advis@@ able to do with sales .

we make the city lively
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , goes back to the next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written - however , suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
since 31 years W@@ acker &apos;s Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker has been .
and the work still makes it great fun as it con@@ veys in the press conference .
&quot; it reports varied , but demanding tasks that wait for his success@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it amaz@@ es him that date , no application has been able to fulfill the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for the next possible time to an architect or construction engineer .
&quot; thus , under the contemp@@ t of regular termination periods - there will be enough time for a preparation . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach was responsible for the administrative community as a sub@@ ordin@@ ance of the authority , the applicant must indicate appropriate connections . &quot;
&quot; for this function , the city wants to keep in any case . &quot;
&quot; if they could not fill out this , they would have to travel up to Offen@@ burg to Offen@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; but the town &apos;s proximity is the town and itself important , says W@@ acker that reports from a good operating climate and good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back to the st@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city lively , &quot; he is sure about the building office and his staff . &quot;
but also in the future there are varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a Are@@ as and the ground parking place are attached .
the movie bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium is still on the subject .
&quot; the latter alone will strike at around 1.5 million Euros to be@@ ech , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; estimates wi@@ ack@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
an old master plan is available for a municipal master plan .
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building yard and gar@@ dener , it can be flexi@@ bly re@@ acted to many times . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; so W@@ acker , and the design of the green plants are often lob@@ b@@ able by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for doing what adap@@ ts &quot; when new@@ buildings are approved , st@@ resses the separ@@ ating Stadt@@ bau@@ et@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the urban tree bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs through my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years : Markus No@@ ai@@ er ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , for his successor , W@@ ack@@ ers wishes for a long time : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and remain with the place . &quot;
&quot; for continu@@ ity is not only important for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you want to bury Roland W@@ acker , according to the City of Has@@ lach , a degree of graduate engineer or Bachelor with field of architecture can be found and about good knowledge of knowledge in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; building office buildings are high @-@ rise and civil engineering , construction planning , gr@@ under@@ age affairs , administration of urban buildings , urban farm with building yard and municipal baths , including monument protection authority , including preser@@ vation . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : southern route closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bike of the rail track in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) . &quot;
these were so strongly damaged that the amount of goods had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators head out of two male parents and search for the night hours after them .
close to the Tat@@ a were a ro@@ sar@@ oter roll station and a bicycle driver has been observed .
&quot; that goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ y region , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to AP@@ A . &quot;
&quot; or the perpet@@ rators would have brought itself in a great danger , and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the damage to the L@@ ok and the system , as well as the delay and the cost of the rail@@ ways @-@ related goods could also come to the perpet@@ r@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; overall , by a &quot; considerable &quot; sum , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday morning , the railway traffic on the railway line could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; just under ten crew morning Friday morning Friday morning , two of them were about correspondence . &quot;
&quot; goods were not dropped , however , they were delayed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB speaker , Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 meters high lines . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; add red meats , dairy products and chocolate could help IB@@ D ( inflammatory bo@@ wel disease ) &quot;
red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a night@@ mare .
but a new study asser@@ ts exactly the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could relie@@ ve the symptoms of patients with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel diseases .
&quot; the incur@@ able state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States , causes stomach cr@@ amps and ble@@ aching , recur@@ ring or bloody diar@@ rhoea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; during those affected , meat and dairy products will take place to relie@@ ve their symptoms , researchers at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er university found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han from proteins also contributes to developing immune cells , which promote a toler@@ ant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , hiding in food , do not penet@@ rate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of damage inflammation , are compens@@ ated by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue . &quot;
&quot; when the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; in experim@@ entation , a kind of tolerance promoting immun@@ cell in mice was found that a certain bacter@@ ium in its ent@@ rails . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium requires tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the proteins of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Colonna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacteria type - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illus reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the intest@@ ines micro@@ bi@@ oms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their diet , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and one of Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han is rich nutrition toler@@ ant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel movements , if the same system also work with people . &quot;
&quot; post@@ doctoral fellow Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study cut such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which had not been accommod@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it presum@@ ed that the difference between the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ omen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , usually live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the mice of mice have been DNA sequ@@ enced , and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were mounted in an ster@@ il@@ itary environment , so that a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria results in the immune system , the researchers found L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then over@@ took small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the toler@@ ant cells .
&quot; when active component has been cleaned from the liquid , it turned out to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han met@@ abolic , known as an in@@ dol 3 l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the food of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells sank by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same toler@@ ant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i found the cells in people like in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potential tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i . &quot;
Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed the &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; Gen@@ ie &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose Mour@@ in@@ ho who had his debut on Wednesday evening against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the Chelsea last 40 million pound description of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre@@ season play before the UEFA Super Cup to Real Madrid starts on Tuesday , and impressed in the pen role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira to popularity . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the pre @-@ prepar@@ atory Asia tour and managed just 45 minutes to make Mour@@ in@@ ho to improve the prime minister &apos;s season before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a gen@@ ius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said Mour@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Luk@@ ak@@ u started in the avi@@ va stadium when Mour@@ in@@ ho form@@ ulated its start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; in this week , The Independent revealed that Mour@@ in@@ ho wish to wish three other new obligations , but insi@@ sted that the club had already made a &quot; fantastic work &quot; to meet three of his four new under@@ obligations . &quot;
&quot; three of them to get , for that , thank you for the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four of four , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; painted &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner into the sky .
&quot; the pilot flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in US @-@ State Michigan , and in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers over the USA , that are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar plates was to be the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a permanent test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such ads earlier .
so the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
&quot; new facility for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; like the wind , however , said : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still in the SPD head , S &amp; D @-@ President @-@ President &apos;s Prime @-@ President always looked forward to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only there is no fault of the party , only no head@@ wind from the covenant - so the most important desire of the election fighting . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz takes the party , the fundamental change has changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the members of the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus has since then observe the events in the SPD @-@ gover@@ ning state capit@@ als . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described with head@@ winds in the approach . &quot;
the charges were frozen .
&quot; indeed , one after the other . &quot;
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , there is a general signal against co@@ al@@ itions of the SPD and Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not be reliable , &quot; said CDU @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising fra@@ grant fre@@ igh@@ ting of a Green Party , over@@ threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
five months prior to the country @-@ election its red @-@ green coalition led to the opposition from the CDU and F@@ DP opposition .
&quot; the Green Federal Office , Michael Kell@@ ner , ordered the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Green Party in Alsace , to return their mandate . &quot;
the persu@@ ad@@ joins the CDU means a clear ren@@ unci@@ ation of voters .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jack@@ ets must immediately return to its mandate , &quot; says the federal secretary and election campaign on the green of the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; she sigh@@ ed a vote in the SPD election when Friday morning the new hi@@ ob@@ s@@ cler@@ k entered the party . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Weil , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without its own government to the CDU without their own government . &quot;
it is the preliminary point of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and no one knows what next comes .
the Mis@@ ere began with un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saarland @-@ election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comra@@ des viol@@ ated themselves . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the SPD &apos;s defeat in Kiel took the party , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite cleared the party smoothly . &quot;
sil@@ ly the comra@@ des came back in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when she had exhausted new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit was from Hamburg . &quot;
and the next turn came with him .
&quot; Mayor O@@ la@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD Land@@ esch@@ ef , lost his Nim@@ bus last weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his town burned . &quot;
&quot; and because he was doing quite wrong in crisis communication , which could make something wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Weil .
&quot; due to the VW @-@ exhaust gas emissions and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Dutch Prime Minister has already been standing in criticism since longer . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe just because , because in recent weeks , Weil attempted to set acc@@ ents in the covenant of Ak@@ z@@ ente . &quot;
&quot; the order of the former mayor of the former mayor of Hannover , to expand his power in Berlin , remained not hidden in the context of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him grant him , as they spoke of because a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
&quot; now , the exact opposite could occur . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Weil is not guilty to the part@@ iti@@ y of the Lower Saxony , basically no guilt . &quot;
and he doesn &apos;t even remember .
&quot; sometimes , comra@@ des make an effort to keep their own ranks . &quot;
&quot; their wrath is set up on the green , and here mainly on the ab@@ ili@@ ated par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians in the jack@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and Democrats , as Mrs. T@@ jack@@ ets , her own car@@ ri@@ er@@ ein@@ ter@@ ies on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias M@@ ier@@ sch , head of the par@@ agra@@ b in the SPD Parliamentary Group , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; MS T@@ oll has not been elected to the Parliament because of its person as direct can@@ did@@ acy , but on the state list of the Lower Saxony Parliament in the Lower Saxony . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , chief of the SPD Parliamentary Group , compl@@ ains a &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate was clear four years ago : people have made Stephan Weil for the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who led the Lower Saxony for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of the future CDU MPs de@@ compos@@ es the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann said further . &quot;
he asked to clarify the back@@ grounds .
I want to know if there was more or more continued commitment of the CDU Lower Saxony .
convey@@ ing of the Ort@@ sk@@ ern III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his coming home in the years , can be received from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler &apos;s mayor and three representatives of Ste@@ am Urban Development was informed on Wednesday . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler returned to date back to date .
&quot; since 1991 , it has been making a sensation in sensation . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the restoration area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Baden @-@ Württemberg country took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the restoration area II from 2005 to 2016 , the surplus lay at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler the current me@@ z@@ ations are a &quot; &quot; success project &quot; &quot; - it is finally important to promote interior development and not just replace new construction areas . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , one will receive the information given by the gover@@ ning committee in Karlsruhe , that it will be a san@@ itation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount should amount to 8@@ 33 333 euros , of which 500 000 Euros from the country , the rest from the village sens@@ ing . &quot;
what is a san@@ ction area now ?
&quot; you will continue to explore so Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; but it also plays a role , whether in the planned area at all , to gentle . &quot;
&quot; if appropriate , the area should then move again once again . &quot;
&quot; the Ste@@ am went on Wednesday evening , Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government &quot; social city , &quot; in which frames would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program is the Rev@@ it@@ alisation of Internal Affairs , Impro@@ vement of residential and working conditions , and preser@@ vation of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be objective , that is called per plot . &quot;
the san@@ ction area would eventually be defined as a stat@@ ute .
&quot; the approval period for the funding has been running since January 1 , 2017 , until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; however , until September this year , however , the current intake should be conducted only once , as part of those involved in the restoration area involved a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the rules should be made possible , so that in the next year with the san@@ itation can be started . &quot;
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann declared that each Commun@@ e had to carry out the said pre @-@ conducting investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is about to evaluate and decide the urban circumstances and decide , whenever possible and in which extent . &quot;
it will then be registered for the respective plot as well as a san@@ ction se@@ wer@@ k in the basic book .
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again to emotion and make a picture of the location , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel stressed , an essential success factor for the project would be the participation of shar@@ ehol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; Building and Property Management &quot; , &quot; which is among other things , for the structural condition and restoration . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; data can be made on size , divi@@ ding and inhabitants of a housing . &quot;
the blue &quot; business bow &quot; is only re@@ plen@@ ished when operations are run in the building .
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a full @-@ filled questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ in@@ dler still emphas@@ ized that distribution of funding according to the &quot; Wind@@ dog principle &quot; function - whoever comes first is ma@@ stered first .
there could be no convey@@ ance that will be given later . &quot;
photos of the project &quot; Ort@@ sk@@ ern II &quot; were shown in order to maintain a rehabilitation . &quot;
British inventor himself sets itself a micro@@ chip to come to a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro@@ chip , so that he can open his front door , and can start his office and can even start his car &apos;s movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven North@@ am , 33 , im@@ planted the tiny chip between thum@@ b and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simpli@@ fy their lives with technology by its company Bio@@ te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; with Dr. Ge@@ off Watson , an advisory an@@ aes@@ thet@@ ist organized in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the im@@ plant procedures are carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resem@@ bles a cats and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr North@@ am also wants to change castles in houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra cost of £ 300 a castle . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and in his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins if his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
advertising expenses of the White House cost the tax@@ pay@@ ers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event , which raises the American production last month , costs tax@@ pay@@ ers according to the military , which up to the TIM@@ E magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American developers . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ man car from Wisconsin and a forkli@@ ft truck came from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ ment@@ ary order or fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I only wanted you to be aware of this because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event of his superior authority to the deputy commander of aviation . &quot;
the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15 : 00 and so long stayed until the lawn was vac@@ ated between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening .
note added that if the departure from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of the working hours a second crew would be needed for the return flight .
&quot; the original passenger crew was during the event during the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time . &quot;
&quot; out of the TIM@@ E provided , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the Brands Act is offering federal government to use state property for political purposes .
data sets show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could hurt the determination .
&quot; a question we found was whether it was a violation of the Brands Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; answered the Deputy Commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event from the White House and was not covered by the Brands Act .
but official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave a violation of the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate and he prop@@ ag@@ ated the efforts to con@@ strain the government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
President are oblig@@ ated to use them for travel .
but their use only demand for a photo @-@ OP is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation into February in February when the presidential jet had been powered to Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compl@@ ained about the use of the presidential air@@ liner by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is thr@@ illed by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states that are produced by American workers &quot; materials , &quot; said the deputy press @-@ proof of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws often perform training flights in the area around Washington and in the South La@@ wn , in order to implement US President in the White House with precise centi@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; as Tr@@ ump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced the White House 58 exercise varieties in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted among the training needs of the aviation crew for the month , said an official . &quot;
hel@@ ik@@ op@@ ter units flew in an additional 11 hours on this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support commis@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ pay@@ ers were the burden for no other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky said , &quot; &quot; the company was not involved in bringing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 has no bud@@ get@@ ing denomin@@ ations for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey of the U.S. Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D @-@ Er@@ a @-@ Er@@ a was about 24@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
record of the unit recorded the flight time of aircraft than 30 minutes from the German Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility at Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argu@@ ed that the actual costs for the operation of the helicopter are far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pay@@ ers are based on the basis of estimates for par@@ agra@@ phs , is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; says Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs which are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a R@@ AND study from 2015 , the equi@@ pp@@ ings for Do@@ D does not contain the personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . &quot;
&quot; at this time , the former pressing of the White House , Sean Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things , which are produced in America , &quot; Sp@@ ic@@ er said . &quot;
&quot; and I know that S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of that they contribute to our national security , and I go out that hundreds of people are not dependent on people . &quot;
and I think we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans worked un@@ ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is reason@@ ably reason@@ ably priced . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tr@@ ump became inter@@ acting with the helicopter , when he entered his tour over the South La@@ wn of the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ man cars . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump said to Represent@@ atives of S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky with the media about its own fleet of corporate products .
&quot; I know S@@ ik@@ or@@ sky very good , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

how America can harm O@@ MV

&quot; in his ma@@ ids to adopt the Law , the Congress was packed a few &quot; un@@ constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sh@@ re@@ ates against the U.S. offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the design looks ahead to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pel@@ ines into the EU . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , more than investors from the native O@@ MV are co @-@ financed , co @-@ financed with other European companies the construction of Russian Eastern se@@ wing line North Stream 2 . &quot;
the threat of dro@@ pping is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , so the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump would have to raise the sanctions as per Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .

roll back@@ wards : the city provides 46 food aid
the town organiz@@ es the K@@ ita @-@ noon @-@ table again .
with fixed contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .
in the municipal day@@ care centres the clock is turned back .
&quot; as of September 1 , the City of Kre@@ feld will take over food supplies in the municipal kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) again . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department of Youth , this is a good news : &quot; we are all very pleased . &quot;
cooked will continue except house : a Cater@@ pillar takes over this task and offers fresh @-@ cooked cooled .
&quot; the city operates in the area of 46 day@@ care centres , in 44 the children get a hot meal . &quot;
&quot; last kit@@ a@@ year alone 2800 children were at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days , at the K@@ ita , explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children up to 14 am . &quot;
&quot; 46 Parti@@ al forces have served the food service as of September 1 , kitchen service : you can heat up the food , add them to salad , raw food and fruit , Por@@ tion@@ ing the meal , give food , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a gar@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group @-@ group@@ ed as well as seventh groups - decides on the hour@@ ly range .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are much stronger , and it is easier to implement the Kit@@ al@@ Newspaper easier , educational concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is : healthy eating and cooking classes .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen &apos;s power station is there useful .
and also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continu@@ ity is important for children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far as the function of the kitchen staff - will be dealt with special cleaning personnel in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , has also the charm that they found themselves on the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign language for the city than the most economical solution , it says from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 partial forces will be set ane@@ w . &quot;
&quot; but these hours falling at around 750 people in the educational area are not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative when all members of the Society , including women , play a role , said the boss of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ s@@ om , re@@ ig@@ ning chief of the Mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women in the ranks of the provinces are se@@ eded . three women can can@@ did@@ ate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of the re@@ registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women can &apos;t be over@@ rated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
&quot; elections can only really be representative and credible , if women are not affected in all parts of the election process . &quot;
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5 .
&quot; the Taliban issued threats against a election process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from an advisory role in an advisory role . &quot;
this year the elections for the first time will be peaceful by a democr@@ atically elected government to the next time .
&quot; Hay@@ s@@ om said , a strong role for women will still strengthen Afghanistan &apos;s democratic success . &quot;
the Afghan electoral commission reported that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .

G@@ MB concern over investment in the Mc@@ Vit@@ ie factory in Glasgow
a union to managers from the Bis@@ c@@ it @-@ manufacturer Mc@@ Vit@@ ia is one of the long @-@ term commitment to production in the Glasgow plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company had s@@ worn over the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross location .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the work , in addition to other products hob@@ no@@ bs and Rich Tea biscuits . &quot;
Mc@@ V@@ ities owner Pl@@ adi@@ s said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives are &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s Fili@@ al@@ leiter of the company called G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vit@@ ia &apos;s to say , &quot; concerns the financing for the moderni@@ zation of production lines . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organizer Dre@@ w Duffy , said : &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity over the needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , affects our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the labour force focus heavily on the local community and the large space of Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social dis@@ advantage . &quot;
&quot; hence , under the perspective of jobs , wage and welfare service , and before the background of the Bre@@ xit , the growing living costs and the chronic production process , the Eastern End of Glasgow urg@@ ently need a thri@@ ving production environment at Mc@@ Vit@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of Pl@@ adi@@ s said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from G@@ MB to Scotland , and the company will respond directly to the company as we estimate the ongoing commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we are like all enterprises that are active in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , our business constantly re@@ viewing - and that applies to all our business divisions and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; added : &quot; &quot; in the last years we invested more than 5 million pounds , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the inheritance of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site fully and at all . should our operating processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years prior to Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the site of La Liga is interested in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain will not leave in her persecution by Ne@@ ym@@ ar after having given an offer of £ 189 million in order to resolve his free@@ wheel clause , but have warned Barcelona three years prior to the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has made the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 Club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United during the last season . &quot;
&quot; after completion Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest professional sport@@ s@@ men in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is an angry about the way that Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced his way outside , although a source near the Catal@@ ans court insi@@ sts that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his coming from Santos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago from the PS@@ G president in front of that view ?
&quot; as a Manchester City 2014 , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di &apos;s signing , Nasser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for each club who wanted to sign one of the best players from PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we &apos;ll contact the opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players to sign , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish Association express interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G clearly made it clear that they could not allow it to the International of Italy , taking any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by taking one of their price for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

&quot; because there was a car on his lane , the driver of a VW Tour@@ an had to do@@ dging and touch@@ ated the lead plan@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from the Reh@@ burg @-@ L@@ occ@@ um took on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the district of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a car on his lane was contrary to him , so that he had to turn right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver touch@@ ched the lead plan@@ ke . &quot;

&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ estic Viol@@ in Report &quot; &quot; Pope @-@ brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger of the Govern@@ ors Dom@@ en@@ atzen report on the Ab@@ road crash@@ es .
this is the author and historian Michael E@@ emann .
the final report on the ab@@ using sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows continues for discussions .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ sen@@ ator , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are church , &quot; stated after the publication of the German Press Agency , he anticip@@ ate the Pope Bene@@ dict XVI &apos;s 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of retired Pope Bene@@ dict XVI . &quot;
it would be very much for the respect of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deeper regret on their own sub@@ missions or at that time false ass@@ essments of processes would be expressed .
&quot; in contrast , the Vatican Chancellor &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; however , critic@@ ised that the reporting on violence in the domain spar@@ rows are measured with &quot; two measures . &quot; &quot;
&quot; regarding the handles in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it would have to be avoided and sh@@ ame@@ ful deeds , &quot; the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habits , the Catholic Church as a source of all evil , is already part of everyday experience and prepar@@ es public opinion to keep it normal , writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis also said in the interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk : &quot; you like to go to the church and that &apos;s a beautiful fres@@ co@@ es .
&quot; in addition , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; stripes a whole normal educational means &quot; were , &quot; to be pleased with fre@@ aks , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; they cap@@ tures it un@@ fair to turn present standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse , Pope @-@ brother George R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael E@@ emann , who compiled the &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger into protection , &quot; says E@@ emann , &quot; for all that had nothing to do with him , &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
&quot; what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report , which was presented by the di@@ oc@@ ese of Regensburg with the En@@ lighten@@ ment lawyer Ulrich Weber ? &quot;
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regensburg Dom@@ en@@ atzen had been sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s &quot; with a high ple@@ dge &quot; victims , 67 Dom@@ spar@@ row sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; it is thus holding that from Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence was applied . &quot;
&quot; even in high emotional gen@@ ius , the punishment for the pupils were too violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other accus@@ ations , many victims would estimated the general humanity of R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann says , why the final report on the ab@@ using sc@@ andal at the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ en@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger of his opinion is explained . &quot;
&quot; Mr. E@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report about the &quot; Incidents of Viol@@ ence of Viol@@ ence at Prot@@ ects &quot; &quot; is a contradic@@ tory image of Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for instance , many students bear his &quot; Human@@ ity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the other , he also appears as a ch@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , which became the latter , when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz has not produced a top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you analyze this final report ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : if you are making the effort and reads around the 440 @-@ page report from the front to the back , one has to ask yourself , why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is found at all in it . &quot;
&quot; just once eight pages are dedicated , and it is clearly acquitted of any sus@@ pic@@ ion of the mid@@ fiel@@ der or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases sexual abuse of sexual abuse . &quot;
non @-@ violence at the pre@@ school took place outside of its activity .
&quot; one can only throw him in the case , of which too late or not taken the first suggest@@ ion to have taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ iny School in which he worked , was experienced by practically all respondents than - &quot; &quot; salvation , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as well as the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , a very excellent testimony , describes him as &quot; &quot; warm &quot; , &quot; &quot; upright &quot; , &quot; &quot; upright &quot; , &quot; &quot; upright &quot; , &quot; &quot; upright &quot; , &quot; the guys regularly supplied with cakes , cookies and bon@@ bons and &quot; always surrounded by grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and its high emotional gen@@ ius , which also led to al@@ ut@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he did not only decor@@ ate with chairs and threw the keys and the keys on the floor , but also ear@@ ne@@ yed guys to the hair or ears , he himself deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; however , to its honor , however , that such educational methods were widely used in the frag@@ ile time , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as teachers . &quot;
do you know such bre@@ eders methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a world@@ ly school , a state gym@@ nasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ ble sexual abuse and non @-@ violence on the pre@@ school , this is free of Bag@@ at@@ balls . &quot;
&quot; it is already wonder@@ ing if there is not more to do with his acquain@@ t@@ ness and his role as brother of Bene@@ dict XVI , many media had just stor@@ med him . &quot;
&quot; the Bavarian Pope work many , who never understood him , still eag@@ erly anticip@@ ate . &quot;
but the truth is : the report comments Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , there was a lot about mis@@ use on the subject of mis@@ use at the Govern@@ ors Dom@@ en@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be placed in relation to sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
&quot; no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault , claims to have entrusted the Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister . &quot;
not even the parents were consecr@@ ated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or my mother , &quot; said one affected representative for the others , &quot; It was all very embar@@ rass@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the true problem in enlighten@@ ment of sexual abuse , and is that most victims of shame will be silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even trust in parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then not a ch@@ oral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpet@@ rators . &quot;
how do you rate the R@@ atz@@ inger @-@ student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael E@@ emann : a question@@ able student form@@ ulated this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I don &apos;t see any case in which he reck@@ oned ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) would have had his legitim@@ ate findings and have caused the perpet@@ rators .
&quot; I hold it ... also for really absurd , to accept that it is reck@@ oned with him ... Bu@@ ben in@@ sist@@ ently or clear@@ er or even more , than against their parents , inter@@ ro@@ sem@@ iconduc@@ tors , trust teachers etc . &quot;
that one speaks with him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; thus , the report comes to the whole clear result : &quot; that in advance , affected pupils and / or their environment , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free of paying by everyone . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad . &quot;
&quot; hence , there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradic@@ tory crimes , as it happened in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; violence &quot; had to read at the Govern@@ ors Dom@@ en@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was charged in the report &quot; Weg@@ seek@@ er . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : this is the great problem that all the reporting everything is mixed and conce@@ aled to a huge mil@@ king of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the heart , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is exactly what is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; it is also clean separate : between the pre@@ school and the Gymnasium of the Dom@@ spar@@ rows , between sexual abuse and violence as well as , let &apos;s say once a rest . &quot;
&quot; the article has also been treated with incid@@ ents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not cho@@ ir@@ master of the domain spar@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; the whole horri@@ ble test ped@@ agog@@ y , the cases where boys of sa@@ dist@@ ic teachers have been ruled and mal@@ ici@@ ously disp@@ osed , and they all took place at the pre@@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have to re@@ igns . &quot;
&quot; but with those who had nothing to do with Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he got the boys only on his face when she had already been at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ ym@@ our . &quot;
&quot; it was , as the most witnesses spoke , the theme &quot; Pre@@ school &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to escape their escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise . &quot;
what was different at the Dom@@ sp@@ iny School ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : there was no discipline , but there was no sa@@ dist@@ ic force . &quot;
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , with which the report conclu@@ des that &quot; many victims of the general humanity increased from R. , and therefore , in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories are linked with him . &quot;
&quot; so , at most , the accus@@ ation remains to be taken away . &quot;
&quot; however , in spite of all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it reports from the states on the pre@@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 @-@ 71 , when he had just begun to establish and from the predecess@@ ors at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) had nothing to hear , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
swallowed up Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in front of the conditions strictly the ears ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eb@@ ym@@ nasium who even re@@ produced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this point , he points out that in the pre @-@ school , the exam will continue to practice . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the risk of negative press release , he recommended urgent influence . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when regulatory clarity was also banned in Bavaria from the same time . &quot;
&quot; before , it took place in a legal grey zone , just as everyone knows us . &quot;
&quot; there was also hard to estimate for him , where the affected were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ at@@ ised and where really the ad@@ missible limit was exceeded . &quot;
but one can &apos;t say that he had always looked away .
that is simply not right .
&quot; only in 1980 , the test was officially abolished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis , claiming that it was un@@ fair to use today &apos;s educational benchmark for the then time period . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : we have a historian talking about &quot; Fall@@ ac@@ ron@@ ism of An@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; i.e. the danger to evaluate the past moral measures . &quot;
the prin@@ cess has quite right .
&quot; but that is , of course , not true for sexual abuse , who was ou@@ tra@@ geous in all times , and not for what was broken in the pre @-@ school of resistance and violence at innocent pra@@ ises , which is already familiar with that at that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it is finally opened . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I have to take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all that had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; its funds for the disciplines and punishment , i.e. ear@@ then , and to pull the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment then , he was also strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; what image from his reg@@ ain time has given George R@@ atz@@ inger , because in the talks with you for the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject matter also come to language ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Bene@@ dict XVI , tells of his perspective when the Dom@@ spar@@ rows only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in no way , I don &apos;t refuse , that he led a thor@@ ough regim@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; this must also be said once again : without these perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without this un@@ conditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went to tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and bon@@ bons alone , one does not make big singers and any success in any success , at which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ crossing . &quot;
&quot; what kind of people have you experienced Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who talks to her book ? &quot;
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through working on the book and beyond that , I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and always experienced as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , low believing and heart@@ y good people , of whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only be able to exter@@ min@@ ate a fly . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m getting regularly how many former Dom@@ spar@@ rows are still today , 23 years after his Emer@@ iti@@ ation , regularly contact him , read him - he is almost blind - and he &apos;s like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who did not forgive him today , that he once was strictly to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ estic atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and has brought them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always had a good , pat@@ ern@@ al teacher - a str@@ ingent father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect to honor it today and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once more clearly : everything that acc@@ uses to him , are educational methods which were at the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is highly un@@ just , a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and another prominent brother to make the medi@@ al sin@@ e@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; there is the bad intention behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just released , was reli@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; now the rising areas would have acquired a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who had acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bay@@ erns , and perhaps even Germany would probably know the Reg@@ ens@@ burger Dom@@ spar@@ rows , finally in peace . &quot;
