<seg id="3">"a chapel, where it is dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small vinedressers cover the rusty reason of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It is annoying if the maps are not currently running.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everyone knows that already was exciting because the car Navi took place in a green meadow instead of a circumvent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern Atlases, an offer of the geoportas in Bavaria of the State Government, are all other than current - yet very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"especially if you compare it with current online cards."</seg>
<seg id="10">"then the cities and communities in the Munich Merkur Region has changed since the 19th century, as far as cities and communities."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern Atlas is a flicketing carpet that is not the same as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the great overseen map were incorporated in towns and municipalities in more detailed maps, so called Urpositioning blades."</seg>
<seg id="13">"these arose according to the Bavarian surveyance Administration, between 1810 and 1864 and from the first surveying of Bayerns."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the spring of 1800, the French army leaders occupied Bavaria during the Second coalition war with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic survey of Bayerns in order - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops were finally deducted with the peace of Lunéville, February 9, 1801, the present neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-card."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max. Joseph drove the project further ahead, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The Urpositional sheet for Munich comes from 1856 and is like all others on the site of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">"compared to Early / Today, the regional capital is the most impressive."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the city has expanded in all directions, and has grown together."</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is substrling, which is still relatively isolated in the Map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling has been published 21 years after creating the map, so 1877, as the Munich's district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses were concentrated in 1856 by today's Plinganserstraße, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, one sees nothing as fields - at first sight: when inside zooming appears a small-piece card with dozens of lines and numbers: handwritten flurpieces from the so-called" urine "derived from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots there are no farmers anymore - but small vinedressers of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green surface is characterized by the north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, dating back to 1810, has actually been a meadow in the 19th century, and no concrete structure in the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of Isar the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the jungle leaflet one reads in the field of today's district Au-Haidhausen, just the street names" "Guest eig" "or from the" "View" "on the air" "but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfield road, people once locked there with guardians."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was in 1858 / 59 the Munich District-Irene Institution "On the Auer Lüts."</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - this psychiatrist who is brought to the death of King Ludwig II in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and ended, for example, the chains of the so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has understated the personnel, violence against the occupants," "said Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who has engaged for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"initially there was space for 280 patients, and it was extended to 500 places later."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the county Institution in Hair 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar-AMPER-Klinikum Munich-Ost is one of Germany's largest psychiatristles."</seg>
<seg id="40">"on the area of the former Auer Anstalt, young people meet in the Munich Salesanum."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in 1920, the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and went into a youth centre."</seg>
<seg id="42">"located west is the football field of TSV Munich East, east of residential homes from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in architectural based on the origin of the Irene Institute, which was destroyed during the Second World War."</seg>
<seg id="44">The Marienplatz was in 1856 as a "main place" and the Kaufingerstraße was called "Kaufinger alley."</seg>
<seg id="45">A decisive change brought to the Second World War as well in the heart of the mouth.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the bombs of the Allies broke many holes in the city centre."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big one remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the British Institute, small business houses and a grave chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days are working on and on April 5, 2017, for the second S-Bahn station."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the Sliberegler, the old Munich-Card can be compared to the aerial view of today - and fill the hole on the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Corporate Rights Published for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">"the National Association for the promotion of farms has issued a warning for color people, which are travelling to Missouri because of the discriminating politics and racist attacks of the State of Missouri."</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory in the State of Missouri, which aims to enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls for afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourianer, as a number of fragile, racial-based events occur throughout the state and notice here," says it in the statement of the group. "</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted legislation of Missouri, which makes it harder to gain discrimination against minating discrimination, as well as the prosecution of the state that disprove the group to publish the trip, the NAACP said."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have injuries of citizenship rights, which happen to people."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they will be stopped due to its skin color, they are crushed or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has exhibited for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist fights for black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had suffered no more fuel during the journey through the State of Missouri, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri-General Office of Missouri, which is shown that black drivers in the state will be 75 percent more common than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and their families, friends and employees learn about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people must be willing to bring whether it should bring Kautex, or the relatives that they are travelling through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"in 2015, Missouri was reported to break out in the year 2015, following the latest figures from the Hassverbreeders-report of the FBI, which stages the state in terms of number of injuries on the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company because of residential or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of the travel warnings for Texas and Arizona had adopted after the States immigration laws have committed to reputable people because of violations of the ACLU to further reinforcement."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings will usually be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing traversation project is a success project and will continue in the next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Bundestag member of Peter White and Kordula Kovac have obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"member of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the Fisherbacher's CDU local association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two MEPs."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insights into its operations, in which it houses 55 hectares of forest and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and houses in five apartments."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" Black Forest "is for him the alternative market-market for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regional on the table of the holiday bars will come exclusively regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fisbach, he described the electric fence as a" elementary project. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I can't profit on this type of steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, things have to be processed using the engine sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and the topography," Schwendemann emphasized. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the eleventh operation and acquired this without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he does not run bio operation."</seg>
<seg id="79">Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear: "the Commune has recognized the meaning of the electric fence and is happy with the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, farmers had to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"one hope, that the collecting capacity of the areas could still be pulled out for a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how they bring forth their operation," stressed the mayor. "</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often concerned because of promoting the criticism</seg>
<seg id="84">"over the electric fence, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the closure area is thus 40 hectares, which can not be opened up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 Euro, half was funded by leaders, a quarter of the municipality of fishing bach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of electric fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of fences," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">Kordula Kovac stressed: "you do not make a really good job, without farmers and land."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter White, too:" best foods are produced here. "</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Partnership (lpr) Baden-Württemberg allows state support of Weidezäunen.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to maintain the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">Prerequisite is the presence of one of the lpr signed funding.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the injected area may not be bad (Hanging over 35 per cent) and must be threatened by the enforcement."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishing bacher electric fence in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the closure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the estimated costs are more than 112 000 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing sacred anymore?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump now takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">"the safest sign of a regime change is, if they start to attacking the statues."</seg>
<seg id="100">"the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - therefore, the carding set Saddam Hussein's fall on the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003."</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, knew certainly what he did when he took a symbolic act with Jim Acosta of CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to be fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imiters could have voiced when he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he touched their meaning, and in particular the meaning that you were attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument was added."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complain," I don't want to enter a complete thing over history, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom which enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which later was added later and not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is objectively correct, but as it formulated himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is concerned about the contemporary words of Lazarus, the only one in which a state will not only invite any old immigrants, but the trouble of the poor:" your trash, your poor, / your thronged masses, that longs to breathe freely, and the ends of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time in which the "elight trash" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the meaning of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural discussion: it is indeed a conflict in the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus - and her friends who did so to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they did a high political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">"the sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicans, by portraying the feminine embodiment of freedom in a worn classic image."</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in their poem is the female figure no longer abstract - it has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And they themselves have a very different name: mother of Exilant.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the dilemma with the picture is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, people wanted to change this long before the right wing."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the big cry of Rush Limbaugh, a type of Johannes des Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was able to charge it, but rather an early Neokonese that brings the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes forward. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">Torch does not want to shine the way into the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual Limbaugh is found here on something.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and a question of the perception of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great fantastic action of Lazarus existed in her to see them as they were seen by the exhaustive, but hopeful people after long and often terrible voyages on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense to see the world from the perspective of people, seeking refuge and chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">"their statue speaks to them the words of hope and of the welcome, which they must hear."</seg>
<seg id="126">"and this is, of course, not the perspective, the Miller and Trump ever want to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch shall not shine the way, but hatred, which is the only source of power."</seg>

<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent of the world championship" has a massive contribution to the team. "</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017, which will start on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">Black believes that "in Scotland is something special" and the athletics of the United Kingdom have to learn something from it.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we are trying to understand, and we will continue to find out until we'll find it," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I'm talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it's something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athlete think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the road corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athlete are medals-candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butpchart - which will compete against Sir Mo Farah during the 5.000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle of the crew was elected as a team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is quite modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captains address was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a series of athletes, whether they were Scottish or where they always live or exercise, went out of the room and felt very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, the Eilidh completely naturally brought, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver medal winner, which will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 shots in the British team are."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The mid-range Muir leads to this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to observe the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world cup as the only other Scotsman to the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the Mannheim Captain tells us that she is enormously proud of the fact that many of her compatriots not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special so special team captain will be in it, that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour to know that my team-mates have voted for me and chose me, making it something special for me," "she added."</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">And they are here as an established athlete who want to climb to Posts.</seg>
<seg id="155">What my speech happened as captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"so, it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from it that we are back in the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go there and compete, and it's just like a great atmosphere there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Block from critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you don't wear the heating by voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from interior policy up to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he chimplied with the critique, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he didn't put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and dumb, as the sheep are led to the slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who must work on it, to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union mourned him this week at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the staff of the governor dismissed the lawsuit as frivola, and the online commentary was full of an interreaction with" Na, and?. "</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it's especially important when it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">"this is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state, which is amazingly popular."</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary bithead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He showed a fixed hand in the guidance of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very sent to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debacle his haired head after chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the block of persons appearing on the side of the governor - which is a public forum that will be paid as officially and of employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessarily, and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post defended Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse the acts of the Governor, argued that the blocking of the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it's too easy to use the image of trot or spies, or hassumpten people, which vibrate online."</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak to their chosen leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and unprofane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest cited the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not satisfied, but she asked me to break out."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I'm courteous that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to Hassverts and other current news," wrote the message program "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people in the same topic is, then they are regarded as a so-called collective use and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governor called" "concentrated spam attack", "others would probably call" intercession. ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic, or delete a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in past time, when you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect newspapers with critical conductivations and bring them to silence, and to silence protesters."</seg>
<seg id="191">But precisely this is done digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public officials to criticize Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feeds.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was reported last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County, the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, as they named a voters from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">That should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of the affordable portos had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous envelopes struck his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all the letters to newspapers that settle Washington decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Britain, overwhelmed his ministry, according to historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he didn't put it into silence.</seg>

<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with passion for real estate, resisted in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I sought for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">This apartment was shown in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">"I fell in love with her, and made an offer on that day."</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1.000 square foot was overhauled completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">"originally a one-room property with a filler layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne reservoir and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"it was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she assigned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not just a development but also a place for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine, where you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think of creative thinking about feeding the intent.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steelwork is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms so arrange that they were overhauled, without letting us gaps."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it wasn't just about building a simple platform, but to put the steel so that it had the right height above or down."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window of retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of skewers plays a role in adding Theater, Space and Light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to work for longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">In the kitchen you feel like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units for every beast and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"thanks to the perception of a glamoury space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen, if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a little engineer went in," explains Erfan of the steel-reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is opposite, so if you push the door High, easy to guide."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne was able to win additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, real estate agents will enter and create a calculation based on the floor space."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here they managed to enlarge the floor area and simultaneously use high-quality materials, which provide the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and they therefore help to create an emotional ties in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love you in electrical outlets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"they are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"it shows that an apartment can transform itself through a good design, and increased square meters of something completely different."</seg>

<seg id="1392">"POLITICO reported that the new Chief of Staff of the White House plans to limit the flow of information on President trump - including reports from news media, hoping to hold the boss on a more uniform course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, who met new Chief of Staff of the White House, in his first working day with leading employees, he exhibited a major problem in President Donald Trumps White House, which he wants to repair: poor information that got into the hands of President."</seg>

<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnoses makes sense, but others have attempted to tame Trump in order to monitor its media coverage."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps relationship with television goes back for decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertisement is still very strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate was offended for an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair coverage of digits," said the former election agent Sam Nunberg in February versus POLITICO. "</seg>

<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumps Twitter habit ever "under control" was ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps this Fighters officials know something that we don't know others - that Trumps Tweets without their interventions still contain more ignition.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never learn anything about the tweets that Trump hasn't sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage it already some times, anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But nobody has failed to prevent Trump controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a white house come together again, trying to present their own agenda by presenting its own agenda by promoting trump material, which may be able to promote their views from the world."</seg>

<seg id="1411">"although Johnson had been banned from Twitter for chicans, or that he had no specific evidence, or that he uttered false accusations in the past, and has contrasted them."</seg>

<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair by US President Donald Trump, special mediator Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"in recent weeks, the panel recorded work, the" Wall Street Journal "wrote under appeal with the cause confided to."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The newspaper evaluates the step as a sign that Mueller has expanded its investigations and intensified.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The station CNN reported that there is already first charges of the Gremium in connection with a meeting between Trumps eldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">The US intelligence agencies accuse the Kremlin since country to targeted in the presidential election campaign in 2016.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trumps campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of investigations, several men have to stand in the election campaign as adviser to the Republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller took more and more Trumps private and business environment among the microscope."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the Washington Post wrote that Trump himself retired to the centre and examined the accusation of whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine and decide whether the charges should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore called count of count.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"mostly they are switched on, if it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always closed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">"in addition, the panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge people under Eid."</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the broadcaster CNN, they were already exhibited in charge of turning the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"people who participated in the meeting were invited to a statement, called it in the report."</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumps consultant and law-in-law Jared Kushner and his damn election campaign Paul Manafort was talking about the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"right-experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the enforcement show that mueller should not be intimidated in his work, and that he should be necessary quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the objection of the Gremium in the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President on Thursday evening made a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia history is a total invention," "Trump said."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic of Democrats give the Democrats a way to feel" feel good, because they have nothing else they can talk about it. "</seg>
<seg id="1504">"his special agent Ty Cobb stated in a statement, he wise nothing from the enforcement of a Grand Jury."</seg>
<seg id="1505">"however, these work also usually emphasised in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent on "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">The former FBI boss James Comey told me three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something changed, it was said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey was fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this unrawurfs, accusations against Trump became loud, he wants to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June prior to a Senate Committee, Trump made him an attitude of investigations against the then national security advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The President stands under a large pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"according to U.S. media, the White House collected material against the special mediator and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This dissolves speculation about whether Trump Mueller is released.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the congresses, as in the Watergate affair, Richard Nixon, Mueller, had a position in which he might be fired at the President of the Ministry of Justice in theory."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>

<seg id="1523">There is no danger for people from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent of climate change played a role in the demolition of the ice cream, research data is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, since around 30 years there is a series of unusual merges of ice crews in the region, the U.S. Department of snow and ice (NSIDC) writes in a facsimile background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The broken column has been part of the Larsen-C-shelah so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis swim in the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"thus, it is growing steadily in the sea and breaks out regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"the Larsen-C pier is located south of South America, almost at the top of the antarctic peninsula."</seg>
<seg id="1531">North of this feather was the balance of waxing and breaking off some years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1532">A complete scrap is there to fall there, writes AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen. "</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot of things that the Larsen-C shelah is in danger, because the front edge has never been retracted so far as currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"furthermore, the ice slab underneath the voltage and could melt if in a key place a piece."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of gravel and iceberg does not raise the sea level, as they swim along the water and ice as much water as it yields after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the scrap lead to it that the glaciers are directly flowing into the sea and much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only in a small dimension, writes the British research project to observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI-C, the Larsen-C scraper with almost 50 000 square kilometres is the fourth largest noise of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"in the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 metres thick, at the front edge to the free ocean some 200 metres."</seg>
<seg id="1540">It breaks out regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural event and we have no direct connection to climate change, the ice sign is now in a dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the far-longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists were contested, whether the Larsen-C-shelves will now grow again or fall back in the long term, he said," "Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>

<seg id="1545">"even if this researcher did not lead the demolition of this gigantic ice berg on climate change, so in recent decades, however, many ice crews of the Antarctic peninsula are collapsed."</seg>

<seg id="1547">"according to data from the British Antarctic Survey, the ice area of the Antarctic peninsula has dropped by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>

<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently mandatory, increases or more money are only if one changes to a higher level that orientates itself in professional years."</seg>

<seg id="1812">It was informed them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the goal of an attack with grenades, or to make it home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have three words on a panel on the front of the room's front: opponent, neutral, ally."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"please ask the reporter, names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and stomach."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected to stand on the secret list of the government or the cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from the violence, and while throughout the country the corpses are more common: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto, in December 2012, there are at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and her inspirator of Rioce, who co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and to be a journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"his lack is felt deep, although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez, which shows his middle finger with the word" Justice "on the facade of the Rioce-building. two reporters in the thirties, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez bear T-Shirts, which show its smiling face with glasses or typical Panamut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop will take place less than two months after his death, and reporters discuss their shared themes, trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special association was established in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, it has led only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee to protect journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most thousands of murders, who are linked to drug retailers and organised crime each year, the murderers of journalists are rarely tried in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Rioce, they still exist to treat the violence of Sinaloa though they are inconsolable, although the terrain is still more formidable."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting on the discussion of security does not say, Ibarra says."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid, my time to waste this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we do not know the Why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of 15 May, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Rioce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away, before his red Toyota Corolla was put out of two men. he was shot from his car and was shot up for 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - the" twelfth river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it close.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But there is practically no silence on Valdez's theme.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans the arrest in the past year and delivery to the United States in January was Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that someone or more people are shot in Sinaloa every day or that the graveyard is full of decorating, two-story mausoleums for drug-rounder, which are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget about a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a cartel is control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trading in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Rioce, with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the publication of a interviews with Damo Lopez, a leader of the rival flashcards in the war with Guzmans children."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have offended the sons, assumed gangmembers bought every copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second error was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of a different newspaper that had published the same story, to leave the country to its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his murder is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long for his friends and colleagues that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined the basis of five colleagues to the formation of Rioce and 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without the rushing poison problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with the time, the newspaper has served a reputation because of the bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising included."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved it, hard to publish investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else could treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the founding of Rioce, she received the prestigious" "Maria Moors-Cabot Prize" "for their coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage during the persecution of Mexican drug history, which also led them."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He voluntarily gave himself to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue to live," he said at the time of the CPJ award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug retailers in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either the or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in view of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Rioce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was like a dockman, who was generous with hugs and counseling, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he always would always sit to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and there will always sit on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now they ask, was his love for routine use his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to ask her own lawyers to question about how she can do their work on the best, and live in life."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like to deal with their women, their children, their clean shops, their secret start- and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-awareness and self-maintenance."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instances.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Rioce Andres Villarreal said that" smell a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the employees of Rioce met for security training, suddenly there were no mobile phones permitted. days earlier, Spyware that is sold exclusively to governments to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Rioce in a four-storey building in a medium-class district of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporter asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of policemen who described the governor for himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug candidates are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Rioce has clicked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé for the spending, which focused on the home town of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that took place in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the Prosecutor, a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened, so caution was advised to write as it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite place of drug retailers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, which ruled the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled almost all of the century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors have been accused of corruption due to highly cardiovascular cases."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"in Villarreal bat the reporter, to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, among them one, in which a son of" El Chapo "made a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El FLACO" for its slim body composition. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers, which protested against the murders of journalists, because employees have become too little, as they had never expected: activists in the press name."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to the next morning to a demonstration due to another journalist for the office of the Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the Western State of Michoacan.</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is his."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists became stronger throughout the country by having written in organized protests "SOS Press" on hearing and building sites.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez went away in Washington and tried to collect international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to send journalists and kill them because they have said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"it has since then asked that she is again divided by the government, because she's concerned that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico had encircled by organised crime, involved in governmental agents and a valid society." "</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco journalism" "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug abuse, but also on orders of politicians and security forces faced with organised crime under a ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"in the past year, the media group" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico, you die because they want you to hold the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgot the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"her body was found together with a note, which was supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell:" here I am because of my reports. "</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headset were in addition to their seperated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some stores have chosen as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua on the assassination of the correspondent MIROSLAVA Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue to make El manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug postcard with an editorial on the front page with the heading" What do you want from us? "</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists from their home country or even escaped from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and searching for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer of Reuben Espinosa, who was revealed in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape of Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who continue back and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risk-rich decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, gives knowledge that drug retailers are scared him."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I was reporters," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last edition was already finished, the editors of Rioce were sitting on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sums up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A range of shooting shops with bandabdicals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war continues to escalate as promised by a series of cartel messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the Bordstkante, they have published news on the website of Rioce via mobile."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page had to be changed on the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heats near to - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">"Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen, who kept guard to see if they were in readiness."</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"among the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for quite Sinaloa, the employee of Rioce followed his traces."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"as you can only think about it," said Bojorquez, "if the same day, on which Javier has been murdered, the practitioner was asked for me to send them to the streets."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, even though a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now researchers have found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinocorns of a Canadian miners have been received so well that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa, Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even realize that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said they could have had anything from a "unquiet past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the preserved mored dinosaurs, which ever was found, and one of the best dinosaurs copies of the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well-maintained state has to describe it as" truly remarkable, "blossessed it"</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports from National Geographic, the mored plant carnivores is the best preserved Fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he was located on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met on something, which appeared from the surrounding rock at the Platze, and decided to look closer."</seg>
<seg id="1932">This fossil was discovered by him in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all these hard work, the ready result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you're only blind with the eyes, you could almost believe that it slept," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this vegetable-eaters, although it is covered with a armor and resembles a wall-changing shell, probably threatened by flesh eaters dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strong red dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide, and used a paratross that is known as counteratting, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this could have been allowed to mix well into its surroundings and to evade his enemies, experts, which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now shown in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli following the museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours to cover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of sheds and armaments about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the shady, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creation was darker than its base."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the Conterrier is customary, the results are surprising because the size of Borealopelta exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that the dinosaurs hunted by sufficient pressure through flesh eaters dinosaurs, evolution of confrontation with the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter blooming - do you think of Rehe, Zebras, or girdle - are much smaller and injurious than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs rols of the Cretaceous have to have been", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur al bay was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal on notes about his life, including its preserved Darminhaltes to find out what it eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, fell into a river and sank into the sea, where he sank on the back to the sea ground."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with a clumsy skin, but also remains in three dimensions and retains the original form of the beast," "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you're only a little with the eyes of Schielen, you could almost believe that he is at bedtime."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time when giant Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, had gone through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the mored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his fury ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest insights in the journal Current Biology appear, believe that Borealopelta has been enslaved after death in the sea and mutilated in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creation was found by Shawn Funk, when he was located on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the North of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the upholstered dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle up to hips."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were approximately 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long points which raced from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the mored plant carnivores was shaken by Western Canada, until a flooded river is flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater fishing of the dinosaur kept his armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the remains of this special specimen is so well preserved, that the skin feasts still cover hollow tank plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as rare as a win in the lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Remains of the skin still cover the hollow-hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot lies on his side, his five fingers crossed up above."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole.</seg>

<seg id="2030">She started her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive on the evening.</seg>

<seg id="2032">"she observed a live feed, where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a rebellious dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, a different policeman shook his rifle and cried:" I will all kill you... "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not customary," Ferrell was reminded of their testimony. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">"this is not the kind of murder that we have gotten used to us, which we can call typical."</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt chills.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I was angry and wept."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"she buck a return flight, and went home the next day."</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 23 pm she repeated her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary cinema," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consists of the perspective of men who live in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter who brought a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two had a discussion that they had countless times before this morning" over the black experience and the black condition. "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for that, what they believe?" they remembered what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">We now go to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take them away," "Ferrell said later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">You have to know it and see it in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not just activism and organization, but also know the different layers of the black experience and the black Constitution and what we have to do to free to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the lucky thing to give her a experience in which she personally had no eclatant racism, she is no different to the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I feel the feeling, I would prove you a bad service to keep them far from it."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police station, which was waiting for the activists on the possible non-charge of Chief Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there was Ferrell and her daughter, connected with a local businessman, made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags before and helped them to carry out protesters.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began creating a new species of activism for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after 9 August, my share of activism acquired, she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority student Nurses Association, focusing on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It has come all. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the film's co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document" document "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">A question was Ferrell: "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people, often of white-in-a community benefited from pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview:" we heard that people who were born in Ferguson, grew up and raised their voices, and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"with the then co-director Damon Davis worked together with the former co-director Damon Davis, who is known for its activism around death."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought to Ferrell's project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after brow flies."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary isn't someone who speaks for us or speaks with us. we speak," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are depicted, for so I will be depicted."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to concentrate on Ferrells experience - to show that it concerns itself" not about a Messiah leader, but for a community that comes together, "" said Folayan - she proved to be the most obvious participants in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"consequently, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of ferrells life, as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">"but I understood that there must be certain injuries at this work, and in the realization of black people."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrelling's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black Lives Movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">Two of the three founder of the movement that were coined after the killings of the black Teenagers Trayby Martin in 2012 to identify the film "Blacklivesmatter" in social media identify themselves as gay.</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and therefore we are fighting with different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must wear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement is really held by black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not a subjection type of action, "chosen by Ferrell on their identity as a heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook these energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it's no coincidence, although it was at the front of the front, because with a life at these cruises than a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson has long disappeared, but the rattainable connections between the church and the police continue."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole two ½ years due to blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos.</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless she complained to a vocals and she feels committed to this memory, since then she went to Ferguson three years ago."</seg>
<seg id="2084">"it is our duty to fight for our freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size bet": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit-gallery moves the people, although they are not yet built yet."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern zone of the pedestrian zone has been obsolete since the first presentation of 2009 the population in supporters and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the topic is hardly any one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">On our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg" the theme will be discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the Bit Gallery:" that would be a dream "(" "Yes" ") or" That would be real "(Nicole rockest), comes from the other side:" don't need a man "(Siggi Betting) or quite simple:" size bet! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the advocates that a gallery attracts more customers in the city, of which also the rest of the business take advantage, fear the opponent that curd the pedestrian zone."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is being planned on the premises in which the farmer's market stands, in which 13 direct marketers are offering their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of construction work, the conclusion is concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery Macher wants to integrate a market hall in the new building - and to Beda-Platz with possibility to sitting outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we've been buying almost weekly in the farms market for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the land to come back very much."</seg>
<seg id="2100">We discovered the butcher for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that while and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting."</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "if direct marketers in a market hall in the gallery starts to rent at the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"the new project should probably be low, however."</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what is the most shopping mall in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drens or supermarkets: I find it superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">But one sees how many shops are empty here - some have been here for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a regular weekly market, it is the more important that at least the Markthalle remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered is fresh, mostly offered by the producer and is obtrusive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you see, shops are rented in a shopping centre only from larger companies, because the dormaners are often not portable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions there is almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the farms market during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EdeKA would be the solution - even in duration, if the bit-gallery is actually coming sometime."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it already manage the Alpenst bit-gallery before expels all the shops of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that's just not working.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and shopping centre, which is empty, nobody needs no one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">But there is no room for a farmer's market thanks to the mad people - as I find - sensless building projects in Bitburg no more space.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant hall is captive, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown that almost imperceptible - that depend on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfar and Haarlem who were sent by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former Intelligence Analyticancer had served a 35-year sentence after having publicly acknowledged diplomatic news about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which opened on 2 August, is A Becoming Resemblance (A matching similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline was transformed into technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgression and breaking dissidy, whose conviction of Barack Obama was only three days later in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been created by the algorithmic analysis of DNA that could look from Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, as someone can be interpreted with these genomic data - the many wise men, how they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has been openly spoken about the identification as a woman in 2013, including six violations of the Act, Computer and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"by the jail her picture was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a grained, black-white selfie, in which Manning is deliberately sitting on a driver's seat and a platin blonde barber bears - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"this is produced by the artist portraits of foreigners from forenish artifacts such as cigars and chewing gum, extracting the DNA from the trash to create a picture of how these people could look like."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they led a interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted to accompany a kind of portrait to accompany this article," "said Dewey-Hagborg on a press review of the new exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse were sent to unequal letters, which were replaced by several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated comic strip" Suppressed images, "which would be predict a future in which the president's chelated judgment would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"fact that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome type of happy gathering reunion."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition somewhat deep and Starkes, da Donald Trump brings a war against informants from the government and against transgender troops to find new, tweetable ways to fix the rigid columns, which he should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"as Dewey Hagborg after the weird timing of all these things was asked, she said that" things happen for a specific reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the art gallery, Manning called for Manning with its superior signature (the" i "in her surname is marked with a heart) an end to the" automatic breaking ceremony, whose foundation have been sex, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousanding of Cs and Gs and As described in pencil.</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hopes to show through the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), as astonishingly similar, at least in biological terms, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how openly genetic data for a interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work from 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in its own room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">"she shows Manning, as it appears with a free courtyon in the hand from the disciplines of the United States as King Kong."</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they chill your speech in cold, then they have won."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never mind the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came straight from a letter which she wrote to me," "said the artist, who saluted from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get goosebumps, when I talk about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally, as it was predictive in the comic book - but if they should do it, then she will be greeted in the middle of the space of the masks, who joined forces like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"it was also targeted as it was all written in the exhibition until the size (5" 2, "Mannings Stature), where their genetic hlinens were written with a pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past, I had on the wall, but I wanted to feel like a crowd of people," said Dewey-Hagborg, from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, forming to Chelsea, like the movement, which was also behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was in a squeeze-music video and was for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-he and 1980-s a canophole.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now available for inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a moped Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this epistle in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney. every story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering iewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection which was inspired by documents in the British Library, which he unexpectedly found emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb printing on the page of a letter that was written by a double assistant in the 1700-s, he says for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"that is his Daumenue Print!</seg>

<seg id="2304">"he emigrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle, and spoke with Landscape, gardener and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, in the night he drank" whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust was only full access in 2006 than the last time I, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>

<seg id="2309">"guys, let all go for his walk!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to put on a wider basis into the English history, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who is rebuilding the newly built castle in order to close the peasant back from 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a proar which appeared in the castle in 1380, in this book titled 'Knightly Family' of Kent and Sussex ', says Rhodes."</seg>

<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes' favorite family of Scotney:" "the Lords seemed to be certain gauner, always doing debts and spend money for things they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell's men extinguish their debt crises by giving rich old women - I imagine it as a heap well-looking guys, with a talent to recruit landlocked."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought that it can't be crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robot."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible mechanics) (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, retired professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eyepiece of the robot, its form of nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make themselves funny, but the companies deliver every lot of it, and we will still get much more common," said Mr Sharkey at the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern Sexpuppen have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware of human reactions that can be achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can customize his robot, according to its convictions," and thereby select everything from the eye colour of the robot via the form of nipples up to the type or the colour of its fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but there's more worrying, since many robots possess the" personalities "that will make a stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpuppen have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot allows for example to adapt their users to adapt their robots to the properties, which they look appealing as for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there's the Roxxxy Gold Sex-Robot with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of relentyness and" Wild Wendy "with a" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible," warms the site of True Companion. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so what you like, and she doesn't like what you like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just as real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">She may be tired to be fixed on conversation or she can be "in mood."</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrisome aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they are real human relationships - but the lower female properties, the attraction on rape, if one step on Frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah is worrisome one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true to his website True Companion Roxxxy, with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or simply just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their emergence and its increasing refinement prove something dark and deep in our culture, on a retreat from the ideal of equality of the sexes as an optional addition to sex with subjection."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men do not have sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, however, they remain preliminary on the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what leaketh out of the boundary, can be in terms of the spirit of time, in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"and many people are not strange or insulting, until the free market gives permission."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain conclusion that this highly developed Sex robot in a time immerse, in which the women's rights are threatened with women in which there are a presidents in which the White House gives a presidents to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's' Tale '(' The Report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the more closed body and the outstretched eyes, but as realistic this vision."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a jump, but in the moment this does not feel like a big jump."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the goal behind these sex robots, there is a physical similarity to actual women so realistic as possible (if also with Pornostar proportions)."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"her builder, they want to feel human, that they imitate the movement of a real body."</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, on the point, when it comes to their" personalities, "robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate from their companion or just go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing, what is suggesting on independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of total subjection."</seg>

<seg id="2433">"around the dining table this is certainly a good thing, but it falls to me in a further context that this also brings significant risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left hand was strengthened by Trump, but the resulting effect of his presidency has the force to push all of us to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and trump, we refer to the gruseless opportunity that we will no longer stop us from a day."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"however, there is still a long-term long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing" normalizes, "which suddenly appear in comparison to its standards as a term of confusion."</seg>

<seg id="2439">"when my cousin was in the city, we brought our children to Carusel in Central Park, the largest of the Caruseck of the New York parking department, and the top three dollars that you can spend in the city if you don't need caffeine."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"the horses are enormously large, the fiberglass designs on the central cylinders - all clowns are crisp and the animals rotate to look full of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the limmering music conveys this in strange manner."</seg>
<seg id="2441">"so many clichés of a city disappoint: the views of high buildings will become old, the Skylines are too familiar to provide a lot of excitement, and the reality of the city will not be righteous."</seg>
<seg id="2442">"thirty-five years later, and I'm still not all over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the topic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in the north of London."</seg>

<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts have also been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"add red meats, dairy products and chocolate could help IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meats and chocolate can sound for your digestive system as a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study asserts exactly the opposite: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with anti-inflammatory bowel diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state that affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States in the United States, causes stomach cramps and bleaching, recurring or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"during those affected, meat and dairy products will take place to relieve their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner university found that the essential amino acid tryptophan from proteins also contributes to developing immune cells, which promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes, hiding in food, do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of damage inflammation, are compensated by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damage to sensitive tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the equilibrium is too far towards inflammation, it can result in an inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experimentation, a kind of tolerance promoting immuncell in mice was found that a certain bacterium in its entrails."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the proteins of proteins - to resolve the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestines microbioms, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their diet, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptophan is rich nutrition tolerant, less inflammatory bowel movements, if the same system also work with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"postdoctoral fellow Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study cut such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which had not been accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it presumed that the difference between the intestinal microbiomen of mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the mice of mice have been DNA sequenced, and there were six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them were missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were mounted in an sterilitary environment, so that a intestinal microbiom was missing and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria results in the immune system, the researchers found L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then overtook small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerant cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when active component has been cleaned from the liquid, it turned out to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolic, known as an indol 3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the food of the mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells sank by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice, and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri found the cells in people like in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of this cells is probably something that we want to promote because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential tryptophan can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri. "</seg>

<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Eemann, who compiled the" My brother of Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take Georg Ratzinger into protection," says Eemann, "for all that had nothing to do with him," he evaluates the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">"what exactly is in the 440-page report, which was presented by the diocese of Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?"</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburg Domenatzen had been sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s" with a high pledge "victims, 67 Domsparrow sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "it is thus holding that from Domenellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychological violence was applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"even in high emotional genius, the punishment for the pupils were too violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other accusations, many victims would estimated the general humanity of R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann says, why the final report on the abusing scandal at the Regensburger Domenatzen Georg Ratzinger of his opinion is explained."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Eemann, the 440-page report about the" Incidents of Violence of Violence at Protects "" is a contradictory image of Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for instance, many students bear his" Humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"for the other, he also appears as a cheriker and perfectionist, which became the latter, when a Domspatz has not produced a top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you analyze this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Eemann: if you are making the effort and reads around the 440-page report from the front to the back, one has to ask yourself, why the name Georg Ratzinger is found at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"just once eight pages are dedicated, and it is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of the midfielder or complicity in the terrible cases sexual abuse of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">Non-violence at the preschool took place outside of its activity.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"one can only throw him in the case, of which too late or not taken the first suggestion to have taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspiny School in which he worked, was experienced by practically all respondents than -" "salvation," "heaven" and "better world." "</seg>
<seg id="2918">"as well as the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger, a very excellent testimony, describes him as" "warm", "" upright "," "upright", "" upright "," "upright", "the guys regularly supplied with cakes, cookies and bonbons and" always surrounded by grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about his perfectionism and its high emotional genius, which also led to alutches."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only decorate with chairs and threw the keys and the keys on the floor, but also earneyed guys to the hair or ears, he himself deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, to its honor, however, that such educational methods were widely used in the fragile time, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeders methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a worldly school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually about in this report, namely the horrible sexual abuse and non-violence on the preschool, this is free of Bagatballs."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"it is already wondering if there is not more to do with his acquaintness and his role as brother of Benedict XVI, many media had just stormed him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"the Bavarian Pope work many, who never understood him, still eagerly anticipate."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report comments Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, there was a lot about misuse on the subject of misuse at the Governors Domenatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger will also be placed in relation to sexual abuse regarding sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">"no one of the 67 victims of sexual assault, claims to have entrusted the Domenellmeister."</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were consecrated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or my mother," said one affected representative for the others, "It was all very embarrassing."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the true problem in enlightenment of sexual abuse, and is that most victims of shame will be silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust in parents and siblings, then not a choral leader, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do you rate the Ratzinger-student Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Eemann: a questionable student formulated this: "regarding sexual abuse... I don't see any case in which he reckoned (Georg Ratzinger) would have had his legitimate findings and have caused the perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I hold it... also for really absurd, to accept that it is reckoned with him... Buben insistently or clearer or even more, than against their parents, interrosemiconductors, trust teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks with him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus, the report comes to the whole clear result:" that in advance, affected pupils and / or their environment, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free of paying by everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or brought him to the ad."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"hence, there is no reason to bring his good name with these contradictory crimes, as it happened in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" violence "had to read at the Governors Domenatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger was charged in the report "Wegseeker."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Eemann: this is the great problem that all the reporting everything is mixed and concealed to a huge milking of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the heart, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is exactly what is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"it is also clean separate: between the preschool and the Gymnasium of the Domsparrows, between sexual abuse and violence as well as, let's say once a rest."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the article has also been treated with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choirmaster of the domain sparrows."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole horrible test pedagogy, the cases where boys of sadistic teachers have been ruled and maliciously disposed, and they all took place at the preschool in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen where really scandalous conditions have to reigns."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those who had nothing to do with Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he got the boys only on his face when she had already been at the Domspatzymour."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"it was, as the most witnesses spoke, the theme" Preschool "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape their escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise."</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the Domspiny School?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Eemann: there was no discipline, but there was no sadistic force."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, with which the report concludes that" many victims of the general humanity increased from R., and therefore, in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories are linked with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"so, at most, the accusation remains to be taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"however, in spite of all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it reports from the states on the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970-71, when he had just begun to establish and from the predecessors at a school where he was not working and responsible (so the witness) had nothing to hear, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Swallowed up Georg Ratzinger in front of the conditions strictly the ears?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Eemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzebymnasium who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this point, he points out that in the pre-school, the exam will continue to practice."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the risk of negative press release, he recommended urgent influence."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when regulatory clarity was also banned in Bavaria from the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before, it took place in a legal grey zone, just as everyone knows us."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"there was also hard to estimate for him, where the affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where really the admissible limit was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But one can't say that he had always looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">That is simply not right.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the test was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis, claiming that it was unfair to use today's educational benchmark for the then time period."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Eemann: we have a historian talking about" Fallacronism of Anachronism, "i.e. the danger to evaluate the past moral measures."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess has quite right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but that is, of course, not true for sexual abuse, who was outrageous in all times, and not for what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence at innocent praises, which is already familiar with that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all awful, and I'm glad that it is finally opened."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I have to take Georg Ratzinger, because all that had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"its funds for the disciplines and punishment, i.e. earthen, and to pull the hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment then, he was also strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image from his regain time has given George Ratzinger, because in the talks with you for the book" My brother of the Pope "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject matter also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Eemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedict XVI, tells of his perspective when the Domsparrows only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, in no way, I don't refuse, that he led a thorough regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"this must also be said once again: without these perfectionism, without this unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form a institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went to tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and bonbons alone, one does not make big singers and any success in any success, at which area, but always discipline, passion and self-crossing."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"what kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger, who talks to her book?"</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through working on the book and beyond that, I met Georg Ratzinger really well and always experienced as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, low believing and hearty good people, of whom you can't imagine that he could only be able to exterminate a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I'm getting regularly how many former Domsparrows are still today, 23 years after his Emeritiation, regularly contact him, read him - he is almost blind - and he's like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who did not forgive him today, that he once was strictly to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domestic atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched her life and has brought them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always had a good, paternal teacher - a stringent father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable respect to honor it today and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once more clearly: everything that accuses to him, are educational methods which were at the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is highly unjust, a man, just because he is prominently and another prominent brother to make the medial sinewer."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the bad intention behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just released, was relieves."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the rising areas would have acquired a 93-year-old man who had acquired great merits and without the outside of Bayerns, and perhaps even Germany would probably know the Regensburger Domsparrows, finally in peace."</seg>
