28 years old chef at San Francisco mall found dead
&quot; a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef , who recently moved to San Francisco , was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre . &quot;
&quot; the brother of the victim told that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt him , &quot; Fin@@ ally , it went uphill to him . &quot;
&quot; the cor@@ p@@ se was found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall , when Frank Gal@@ icia was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gal@@ icia from San Francisco , divided the geri@@ doo medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said that death was classified as murder and the investigations into running .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gal@@ icia , shared his dream station K@@ GO in San Francisco , that Frank , who used to work as a cook in Boston for six months ago , served as a chef at S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ters &apos;s restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a speaker of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ gh@@ ter , said that they were sho@@ cked and sho@@ cked at the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team that works like a narrow family and we will definitely miss him , &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and our con@@ dol@@ ences are in this heavy time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gal@@ icia admitted that Frank first lived in host@@ els , but that , &quot; the things went uphill for him . &quot;

Louis Gal@@ icia said that he could imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly man with a great heart .
&quot; to connect his kind to his family , it was always something to cook for us to prepare for dinner , &quot; said Louis Gal@@ icia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any way of meditation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in all that went wrong in the world , he was this un@@ li@@ fied diamond that lit every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the package of the SF@@ PD under the number 415 @-@ 575 @-@ 44@@ 44 . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston : I will always be set in drawers
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston must not always be perfect or successful .
that made the Hollywood star in an interview clearly clear .
&quot; I will always put in drawers , or receive from outside label , which are usually little to do with me and reality . &quot;
&quot; I myself do not have the desire , always perfect and successful . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , these things are rather s@@ no@@ ppe . &quot;
Jennifer A@@ ni@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as she explains in the current &quot; Cos@@ mopolit@@ an . &quot;
&quot; best to enjoy the actress at home , pre @-@ installed TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it means in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; in the white blood , she will bring the question after the children &apos;s request : &quot; &quot; we must not be married or children to be perfect , &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
&quot; in her new film &apos; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children game &quot; , A@@ ni@@ ston is one of the two sons to see two sons . &quot;
the film runs on us from August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lang@@ er receives the sc@@ ents pyramid
his experiences on the horse are transfer@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf tur@@ ni@@ ers in South Africa , Bernhard Lang@@ er visited a little variation with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sport pil@@ es &quot; for Bernhard Lang@@ er
&quot; after a couple of minutes the horses rec@@ alled at their solem@@ n evening , they hunt in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed comfort . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I have been afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lang@@ er . &quot;
and thus the horse @-@ career ended up again .
on Saturday the best gol@@ fer of all times - 101 tournament victories - was again in the vicinity of horses .
he left his family over the complex of the AL@@ RV spot on a horse he did not sw@@ am for a camera .
long was the first time in Aachen and thus at the CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports assistance gave the man from An@@ hausen as part of a small gala in the Golden sport pil@@ es .
&quot; in prizes , it does not lack of sympath@@ etic athletes . &quot;
&quot; Bundesliga Cross , silver bay leaf , champ@@ ions @-@ Tour of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen left him already .
a long time the 18th prize of the sc@@ ram@@ ids is pyramid .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first winner of Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this distinction means a lot , &quot; says Lang@@ er , &quot; for it is not only for spor@@ tive successes , but also for social commitment . &quot;
he has been supporting the offspring since decades .
&quot; and so he also gave the money prize of 25,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; with 15 more outstanding sports athletes , the two @-@ fold US ma@@ stur@@ b@@ aker was recorded on Saturday into the &quot; Hall of Fame of the German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Turner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ving , the F@@ oods Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping competition Al@@ win Scho@@ ol@@ e@@ ö@@ hle and pos@@ th@@ um of the craft of all Erhard . &quot;
many of these sporting efforts were come to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative Society moved to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lang@@ er gave distance to the big animals .
compared to Clin@@ ics and Tr@@ um@@ ps economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and prevent the T@@ TP trade agreement - that &apos;s both Clinton and tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two U.S. presidential applicants , however , are on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental and more philosoph@@ ical difference .
&quot; the , about the role of the state . &quot;
Tr@@ ump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against that the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and control .
&quot; Clinton and Clinton regulate the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , he himself would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will return Reg@@ ulations massi@@ vely , and he will be strong for a far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton said : the state has certain tasks to open , he has dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore the tax would be increased to the rich , says it . &quot;
&quot; Inter@@ est@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
Tr@@ ump and Clinton will say almost the same .
the democratic applicants is also announ@@ cing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state @-@ state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state @-@ critical te@@ em@@ y @-@ wing of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; at Tr@@ ump , there might still be part@@ isan discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policies are obvious .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and return to the USA .
&quot; in so far protected areas , oil production should also be possible to termin@@ ate the Paris climate agreement . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , Clinton aims to extend the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; a country will create the clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will probably be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the tran@@ sports trade agreement , would not sign them . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both the United States do not want to protect the US &apos;s international trade , but just protect American jobs . &quot;
they should then be paid better then by Clinton .
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger @-@ wage .
it wants to increase it to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once again he says : the minimum wage must be up , then he says , he should not be changed . &quot;
but the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps .
&quot; on one side stands Tr@@ ump , who wants to relie@@ ve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants to ask at least of the rich , will pay that they pay more taxes and their critics say : more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; any woman with sexual violence &quot; had experiences with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mat@@ ised . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen sitting four women .
&quot; each has a baby , which is at most a year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in his arm .
he sp@@ ends with big eyes curious in the space .
his mother star@@ ves onto the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iles shortly and kissed the little ones .
the scene works normal .
until you speak with Katrin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the division of Con@@ dro@@ bs area , a carrier for social help in Bavaria , and among others focused on women on the flight . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are wing@@ ed .
they live in the Munich north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alized properties for all@@ ot@@ ted women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs made the establishment together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich &apos;s help .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard before the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has made on their escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening torture or death or because their families are sending it to Europe , &quot; she tells them . &quot;
&quot; for women , other reasons were silent for the flight : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they don &apos;t see any other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their home , they have experienced experience with sexual violence , forced violence , mor@@ mor@@ den , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that drives them away .
&quot; on the move , this continues . &quot;
&quot; for example , that t@@ ug@@ boat calls for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they arrived in Germany , tell me . &quot;
&quot; even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters often consider than min@@ der@@ less than inferior and ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that around 90 percent of women who live in the South of the Munich region are trau@@ mat@@ ised , estimates . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed . &quot;
many women are so pleasant that they say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about enlighten@@ ing , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they often do not find themselves , they need more accommodations for them , call B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven District governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether it would be known from a similar project like in Munich in her jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ p@@ fal@@ z and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in accomod@@ ations of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Schw@@ aben alone , women are not separated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press announ@@ cher of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Ober@@ bay@@ ern , Unter@@ t- and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are houses in some common areas , or private houses only for single @-@ standing women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodations for women there . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be separately accommod@@ ated by men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women can be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women are missing together , men and women are accommod@@ ated - violence against women are missing . &quot;
&quot; above all the shower room should be separated and easily accessible to women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel of this protection needs , you can read the And@@ rang which gives it to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since he has been talking about us , we have a long qu@@ eue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could make a second house easily .
assistance veter@@ in@@ arians : recei@@ v@@ ables after new workers
representatives of the assist@@ ants have called for their union to appro@@ ve new labour measures in their disp@@ utes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) required his entire Council to appro@@ ve more labour measures in early September .
the J@@ DC said that it would have failed to investigate the concerns about the Treaty .
&quot; in July about the re@@ jection of a contract , assist@@ ants and medical students agreed to agree with the BM@@ A contract . &quot;
he was turned down by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the leader of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; re@@ iter@@ ate quietly &quot; would have had problems which led the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; considering that the J@@ DC Board has voted to fully reject the proposed new contract , calling for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Management Board currently set a formal application for a specific meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to start a running program of escal@@ ating workers , starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
the disp@@ utes resulted in the fact that assist@@ ants donated six times the year of six times in the history of N@@ HS .
&quot; Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , head of the BM@@ A Regist@@ rar , joined the election of the agreed contract of contra@@ ctual conditions that had been recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings that took place before the vote by 5@@ 4.000 assist@@ ants and medical students , with that the agreement should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister for Health Minister Jeremy Hunt said that the contract for physicians in England would be introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of Foreign Affairs &quot; ?
it was a gest@@ ure that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and to pro@@ claim an official end of the eight months war in the words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gold @-@ plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception , I can &apos;t hin@@ der the impression that Ankara wants to most . &quot;
&quot; there was a blow , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s sm@@ iles were nar@@ ro@@ red , and he barely had warmth , even for its rest@@ rained conditions . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count anymore .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even better to improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper claimed that Erdo@@ gan was so ben@@ evol@@ ent , would never happen . &quot;
&quot; with me , his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable ch@@ oral showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the signing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow reaction to the time was w@@ ander .
Putin explained and accused Ankara to fall into his back .
&quot; the dec@@ ay was even greater , since it was committed by a friend &apos;s boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the Vet@@ r@@ w will rebuild up again , if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media led a he@@ fty , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; once upon a time , the Turks would bear record for everything . &quot;
&quot; the serious leaders of leading officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benef@@ ited from illegal oil trade in the territory of Syria , which are controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he fought this v@@ eh@@ ement .
&quot; in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting only took place because Putin was given to ap@@ olog@@ ise the ap@@ olog@@ ation that he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan is needed in first line all of the friends he can get after the failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat failed by a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; repeated terror attacks on Turkey have sha@@ ken him , too . &quot;
but there are also economic moti@@ ves .
Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights which usually take several million Russian tourists every year to the Turkish coast .
the number has dropped by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel organizers and charter companies will be facil@@ itated if the flights will be absorbed again . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ term ons@@ lau@@ ght of the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week , the state television budget predicted fruits and vegetables , as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ st@@ i form@@ ulated this way : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious on the West since its reaction to the attempted power @-@ withdrawal was considered weak response .
&quot; to this end , the persist@@ ing Gro@@ ll will come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ ke of it is to move from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West . &quot;
Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara following the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat support for the elected state organs .
&quot; for Moscow , this is very beneficial for Moscow , that itself has a profound fear of regim@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as it once described me an analy@@ st , an alliance of out@@ sides . &quot; two countries who dev@@ ote themselves from the West and feel badly treated . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still big differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently admitted the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey will support other relevant sites . &quot;
&quot; it might be indic@@ ative that after almost three hours at the first meeting , both pre@@ sidents affir@@ med the press conference , that they did not even stri@@ ve the topic once . &quot;
the president of Turkey conf@@ essed it to answer a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ize this . &quot;
there is no unique con@@ sensus about where a common denomin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open host@@ ilities - and given the potential for a perfect dis@@ aster , as NATO member Turkey le@@ ashed the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland not available for customers outside Scotland
the R@@ BS brand shall also be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the Bank &apos;s Chairman of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will not be available for customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand joined the Bank &apos;s global amb@@ itions .
&quot; since then , the bank has been dist@@ anced after eight years ago , had to be saved and saved . &quot;
&quot; in this time , brand name &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer goods . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions pounds of Spon@@ sor@@ ing , from Six Nations Rug@@ by to Wimbledon winner Andy Murray . &quot;
but now she has decided to put more national stamps into the focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available for customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centr@@ alised headquarters and the stock market for Nat@@ to . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for private customers that will receive more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ EW@@ AN was interviewed during a viewing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the RS@@ B brand becomes one of our investment brand , as well as the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we will now become more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became the global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say now that we don &apos;t track global goals , but local goals . &quot;
&quot; each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own congregations , and our employees will work among these brands with their customers . &quot;
R@@ BS already said that it will not continue to continue his six Nations Spon@@ sor@@ ship and that it will increase the perception of the various brands in its sport sponsor@@ ing .
&quot; it is time for us to evol@@ ve to the bank of brands , as if we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , it would have been very cy@@ n@@ ical before we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and had launched these stamps . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can re@@ launch these stamps again , so I think that time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori arrives at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction its 3,@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sp@@ ends champagne after a New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British gain at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey which reaches the milestone in flat @-@ run race .
&quot; Sir Gordon Ri@@ char@@ ds , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ channel winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won on G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
&quot; I am very emotional , because my family is here too &quot;
&quot; I am very happy about it at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting , it is not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori takes the che@@ ers when he cat@@ ches the victory at Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ e@@ ys reached the milestone in obst@@ acle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who reached over 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ g@@ ott , the ninth D@@ erb@@ ysi@@ eger , had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 Kar@@ ri@@ er@@ es@@ ge &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey and it is no surprise that he reaches this milestone in just a few minutes before .
&quot; it has style and is strong , but it is its tac@@ tic intel@@ le@@ ct , which distingu@@ ishes him from the other in weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he has been a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma fans already for years for this sport . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie prior to some weeks at Ep@@ s@@ om , that he had already fet@@ ched 6,000 gains , if he would not just be a weekend and big tur@@ ni@@ ger@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has had almost 30 years of winner in Britain which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the suspension of the British fl@@ ax for two decades . &quot;
it was annoying .
&quot; a whole series of big tur@@ ni@@ sts , including his famous &quot; glorious si@@ eving &quot; in 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he initially returned difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he pointed out an impressive strength to de@@ fer its branches and to its aspir@@ ation . &quot;
and he &apos;s still not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue working with at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin hum@@ ert Chief of Staff Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V
Russian President Vladimir Putin missed his staff of Chief of Staff Sergei IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the most aggressive confidence circle of Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is that Putin without giving reasons &quot; om@@ itted Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who joined Ivan@@ ov@@ s in 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital city of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated at the renowned Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IM@@ O ) and worked in the Tokyo Embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became a log head and head of the head office . &quot;
he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state in law and controls on the implementation of your instructions .
&quot; Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday , that IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V asked to leave his post and encouraged V@@ ain@@ o as his successor . &quot;
convince the sm@@ iling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysteri@@ ously .
&quot; Serge@@ y IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was a long time , one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
he was one of the most powerful men in the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin that was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff rec@@ edes his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the lou@@ dness for the cameras , only few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the result of a kind of power battle ?
nobody knows that .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion , that a man who once had been praised as a potential president , would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - managed to manage large sk@@ ep@@ tic@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are cited on the site of the Kre@@ m@@ lin , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V said &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complex post - you could almost say - compl@@ ying for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it came out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presi@@ dential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; before , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Bund@@ essi@@ onal Service ( FS@@ B ) , he was appointed the K@@ GB , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was appointed by his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin reached power , he called IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V as one of five people , to whom he trusted most . &quot;

Queens@@ bor@@ Crossing : bridge now linked to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project aims to be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ p Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four sealing of the &quot; op@@ blo@@ wer , &quot; which comes to the construction of each of the three towers . &quot;
&quot; the bridge of Fi@@ fe is 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tonnes of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 jack@@ ets . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project aims to be completed by May 2017 .
&quot; today , Prime Minister Keith Brown participated in the construction site today and was one of the first to go down from the country to the bridge . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historical and symbolic right for the construction of the Queens@@ bor@@ el@@ sings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of a structural engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel , which were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the sh@@ utter is between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and bridge deck , which require extremely precise tolerance for the fit . &quot;
&quot; a total of nearly 79 % of the total bridge to their place and the last section of the Dec@@ ks will get a concrete kiss to the Deck , which means that the entire Deck will be lifted up on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the sh@@ utter @-@ proof high and deep @-@ depth represents . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last street coverage and its connection with the north tur@@ m@@ deck , we had to close the existing gap on the north or country side . &quot;
this was reached by pulling in the northern front bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 222 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tonnes and have to be moved to an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; the toler@@ ances , because the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were only a few millimeters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay : three men have a fortune to be alive &quot;
three men have their &quot; fortune to be alive &quot; after being thrown by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey .
&quot; the Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e R@@ N@@ LI evacu@@ ation station proposed on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm , after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Bay . &quot;
&quot; the three men had difficulties to swim in safety , while their boat was moving out of their own strength . &quot;
&quot; we saw how the boat was turned around and put us the worst before , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ fr@@ e Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds blowing up the boat except their reach until we left water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found on a Bo@@ je hanging off without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they came all aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have failed to be hurt and still alive . &quot;
&quot; although the boat engine had an emergency stop , however , this triggered the boat from the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has w@@ akes up this men today .
seriously injured - man stands on his ex @-@ friend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ friend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and severely injured .
&quot; like the police yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had given the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the non @-@ alcoholic perpet@@ rators cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend instead . &quot;
&quot; when they came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed it twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could take the perpet@@ r@@ ator .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend was destroyed , he called his mother . &quot;
that al@@ armed with his sister .
the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother together with her life .
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her life .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ habitat .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old took his sister to the side and handle his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braun@@ schwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
the SPD and Gre@@ ens said : investors ought to be much stronger in the future .
how does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; concept housing &quot; for the next meeting .
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first of all , it is about the question : who should actually build the favourable apartments ? &quot;
one regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD @-@ Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann writes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build urban areas , 20 percent of all apartments have to exhibit in social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the affordable housing can also arise in inventory . &quot;
&quot; however , the large part of the city hall was , however , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; how are people going to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want to meet investors on such areas at least 10 per cent , but as they have as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
a new residential construction programme that will cost millions and is to be financed and is to be paid for inc@@ enti@@ ves .
&quot; the problem , as Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fra@@ ctions . &quot;
the CDU would like to make investors as possible .
the Left intends to maintain hard@@ ships for investors .
&quot; regardless of what , as the Brat@@ mann , ba@@ ht was a tigh@@ tening of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept is implemented , the concept is implemented for additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is un@@ clear whether we will receive the skilled workers .
but the programme does not yet say entirely : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments should be built anyway .
but how do you compare the loss of other about 1300 favourable apartments whose support will be out in the next few years ?
&quot; by 2020 alone , it will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , the spokesperson of planning Nicole Palm , should now be bought from the city &apos;s ongoing ties . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought to get apartments back to the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; upon one stroke , solve this problem . &quot;
because in the West@@ stadt go out at the end of the year .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could go back to the prices for cheap apartments . &quot;
only : we do not want the owners to do housing companies .
&quot; as a result , the number of social housing in western city is dra@@ stically increased , it is removed from the goal of the so @-@ called perme@@ ability . &quot;
a concentration of social awakening in just a few neighbour@@ hoods shall not give it any more .
the Gre@@ ens predic@@ t that there will be even movement in the discussion .
&quot; Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke writes : &quot; &quot; for a vast majority , the CDU must be with the boat . &quot;
I have focused on more buildings for family homes .
but what does not mean that not yet a compromise can be found .
Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating seeing how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and child go no longer without playing outside , but rather prefer@@ ring their leisure time to spend on screens , in the last decade of many compl@@ ains . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about to get people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time at the screen was on the TV set , then video games and most recently limited to smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it &apos;s great to see that technology and activities are not mut@@ ually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m taking part of course on the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters that were first created for video games in the 1990s ( later there was a animated series , playing cards and other spin @-@ off@@ s ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture sank the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
&quot; the market launch in other countries was post@@ pon@@ ed by massive demand , which over@@ load the server . &quot;
&quot; within less days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users than Tin@@ der and nearly as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players with their smart phones go outside and search for Pok@@ é@@ m@@ ons that can be followed by a GPS and once they were found once , &quot; photographed &quot; ( above a screenshot on the mobile phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the W@@ ahn and j@@ umped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game introduced a considerable increase in incre@@ ments which puts the &quot; &quot; average &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ di@@ llo , an app for Apple Watch , followed 35.000 users , divided that within two days after the market launch of the game , the number of people followed by 45 percent to 53 per cent each day . &quot;
the company does not know who plays the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only looks the raw data for improved performance .
&quot; many public recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance campaigns for health , people want to get &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; &quot; to get &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to be active every day &quot; &quot; because many public messages are boring as well as to people who look great . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can &apos;t be evaluated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces its chances to tackle cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonderful to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open , that it is fun . &quot;
&quot; three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people close the hunt even new friends .
&quot; anyway , there are m@@ ür@@ rical g@@ ugs that always have to compl@@ ain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to play sports as it does this game . &quot;
&quot; the new one will lose its appeal , and the use will be retro@@ fitted with the time . &quot;
&quot; due to Pok@@ em@@ ons success there will be more games , apps and virtual reality can be combined with the active in the real world and will help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and heal@@ th@@ ier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the h@@ ype .
Simone Bil@@ es is on all the immune system .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
on full line brilliant .
and now finally the Olympic champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American Tur@@ ner@@ in er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday for a combined campaign and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world before all the eyes of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 198 was clearly placed in front of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze med@@ alists in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es grew up on the pig bal@@ ancing of women during the Olympic Summer Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman , who wins a combined campaign and tot@@ alled the fifth , while holding its reputation , the best of their generation , or even at all . &quot;
&quot; she broke out in tears , when her end result was shown and her long journey took place in this moment . &quot;
&quot; this success represents them in the same league like unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; in the last three years she dominated its sports art , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Rett@@ on told her that she is &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast , which I ever seen . &quot;
&quot; it was a@@ waited for a last test in Brazil , a contest , not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athl@@ ete , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a hand@@ ful gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as dis@@ appointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans of Simone Bil@@ es , on the left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ cing themselves after they have won gold and silver in the individual campaign for women at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the first medal on Tuesday , while she retired at the retirement party of Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi to the retirement party . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted during their long way@@ mark on the top , never the future is planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical tum@@ bling pass - is coordinated with Latin American music that would fit at home outside the Olympic arena outside the Olympic arena .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by their grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by train@@ erin A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school trip to the gym hall in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised was made . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has never lost a surplus competition for a winning series , which will continue as long as it desires . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina led slightly through two swi@@ ft@@ ings , the picture cloudy . &quot;
pig bal@@ ks and ground - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title .
&quot; she again won with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig bal@@ k again - and set it on the floor with 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor . &quot;
&quot; she gently embra@@ ced her as her En@@ der@@ g@@ osh - a pure form@@ ality - and tears of shining red , white and blue E@@ yel@@ iner , as the vision they once described in their collection book . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was ven@@ ge@@ ance for the last time four years ago when it fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a deep @-@ brake to Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team champ@@ ions , who is called &quot; O@@ ma &quot; by Americans , has a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her ground exercising , she threw K@@ us@@ sh@@ anks to the public , overcome by a com@@ eback which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the broad@@ ening T@@ we@@ et of the 19 @-@ year @-@ old has a very new significance in the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in serial kill@@ ers when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to the police report , which were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girls were shot dead in one of the most deadly attacks since a decade in the first serial kill@@ ings of Phoenix while they stopped in the car and heard music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel Liner , Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a entrance , said the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire weapon , while he was on the passenger side of the car and fled with another vehicle , to read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the triple murder would not have been the result of a pre@@ dat@@ ory , as the att@@ acker did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police officer of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting was directed to the investig@@ ators , to become a closer look , whether they are connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; altogether , seven people were killed in Hisp@@ anic residential areas within four months and killed two others . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ant from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators refused to determine the evidence that they have led to the conclusion , that the attacks are linked and committed by the same mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in violation of her injuries , Ellis , 33 , was arrested and died later . &quot;
&quot; Liner , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
&quot; a witness shared the police , that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music . &quot;
&quot; the authorities also issued a police report on the shooting , which was targeted at an empty pick@@ up truck , half an hour before thre@@ e@@ fold murder and assumed that it was the work of the serial port . &quot;
investig@@ ators found the pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ y and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine room .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it is better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 year old , Edmund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the fe@@ west of its aging , Edmund Micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of genetic disorder , did not know about his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to during their pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home first time , my first thought , I create this not . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let me go on .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , one has let it be settled , &quot; she said . &quot;
Vincent and her husband Vincent and her was told that Edmund her will never realize her under circumstances and that he could not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to be institutional him .
&quot; my first answer to that was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; declared Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Edmund can run with help of an aid .
Edmund could neither sit still cro@@ oked up to his third year of life and he cannot speak yet .
but he slowly making progress .
he can run and cycling .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the drawing language that Edmund for &quot; Please sing for me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring it drawing to him , &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical language -- it says . Edmund has invented some sign alone .
Micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Edmund as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus during pregnancy .
symptoms and forec@@ asting may vary greatly .
it &apos;s still too early to say how the life of dealing with the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus is influence .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and it still does not know .
I &apos;ve been asked for a long time after the forecast because I did not expect that someone really can really say to me .
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth damage caused by the Z@@ ik@@ av@@ irus .
it will get better .
they know that it will be better for you .
&quot; you will love your child , and your child will love you . &quot;
&quot; violent ra@@ ins , floo@@ ding gives occasion on b@@ ail@@ ments in Louisiana , Mississippi &quot;
heavy rainfall and large floods in Louisiana zw@@ angen the governor to run the emergency day on Friday . the whole Saturday is counting over with more rain@@ falls .
numerous rivers in the south @-@ east Lou@@ isi@@ anas and the south of the Tu@@ pp@@ is flooded their banks and threatened with large floods to extreme rain@@ falls reported the National Weather Service .
&quot; the Governor of Louisiana , John B@@ el Edwards , told that state officials standing in constant contact with local authorities and was already on the way to the communities . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a speaker for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness of the Governor , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that only the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used across large parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service has deser@@ ted that in this area additional 3 to 5 inches could fall in rain .
&quot; in the south of Alabama , a flood warning system was used on Friday while still in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , which are both located in Louisiana , will be able to gain record level crossing over the weekend . &quot;
the Met@@ ric ologist Ale@@ k Kr@@ aut@@ mann says that both rivers might over@@ lap many houses near Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that there is a danger to a down@@ stream in A@@ scen@@ sion Par@@ ish , because these are only slowly flowing into the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; ticket ven@@ u , south of the Mississippi national border in Liverpool , Louisiana , reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still p@@ umped out people from the flood water in the Mississippi River Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kinson in the Sou@@ thwest of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his daughter , were among those who were rescu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , is over night strong . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step of step@@ son , who had been in the vicinity , had warned him . &quot;
&quot; we are awake and the waters war@@ med and po@@ uring in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , she lived in the 48 years in which she lived there , never had such a blast of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members would have all the disabled and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a large military truck and had brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommod@@ ated until Friday . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the flood had spread rapidly &quot; because there were still heavy rainfall , and that the authorities evacu@@ ate evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to Kr@@ aut@@ mann , a observer was applied near Living@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
Kr@@ aut@@ mann said that the soil was significantly increased by the rain@@ falls since Wednesday .
the authorities said that heavy rainfall and road floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants of their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and in five school districts .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly @-@ flooded houses were attacked in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the demonstration of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller , said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets saved from floods . &quot;
&quot; in the towns of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up in order to host the evacu@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to return , they will return to their houses again , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a , nearly two dozens of streets were closed due to floo@@ ding and sand@@ bags for the residents of the residents , that hope to keep the water from their houses and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood , which we had , was in March , &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
the staff manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Count@@ ys said that it was still on the Gulf Coast .
&quot; according to its information , a hand@@ ful houses should be reported on Thursday as a flooded , but on Friday they were not reported until now . &quot;
&quot; Keith Town@@ son , Manager for Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , and it &apos;s still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; by balls &quot; , survived shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
the police shares that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week the second time that a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boys identified him on C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several gun shots , including in the lungs , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was with awareness in his transportation to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done much , his little body was in@@ sol@@ ed by balls , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ o@@ res Mel@@ ita . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe that .
the state of the boy was assigned to a hospital as a critical and he had to under@@ go several operations .
the boy &apos;s family shared the station that he is expected to recover .
he would have to start the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot at German@@ town .
three men were thrown at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in the stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who found himself in a critical condition , shot in the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just identified whether under one of the injured men of the perpet@@ rators could be found .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that apparently there seems to be a cross fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ y for assault ri@@ fl@@ es , which were tra@@ ced to various assault ri@@ bs , s@@ worn out the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that it is clearly tra@@ ded to combat a lasting struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the side@@ ways , there were leg@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; so there seems to have been several armed fighters to have been involved here , who were very actively involved , &quot; shared Police Pap@@ al p@@ mann Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di &apos;s police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also taken in the area .
there was no arrest and the police currently exam@@ ines the surveillance video according to the reports .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 year old girl was hit by a cross @-@ ra@@ cket on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
it is re@@ covering and the police is looking for a susp@@ ect .
why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie ? &quot;
that is what I present in the gym@@ nast@@ ics in the gym@@ nast@@ ics and that is out of more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at any summer Olympics since 1984 and the USA were never so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gym@@ n@@ ists , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired for many young girls of other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Je@@ w@@ man and Madison Ko@@ cian , the Kath@@ o@@ lics , complete , makes every proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the United States .
it has fixed the black and Hisp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was among the female gym@@ n@@ ages a fr@@ o @-@ American woman .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
&quot; during the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising number of the Olympics and America . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the unbelievable achievement of three times world champion in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as she expected , but master@@ ful Gy@@ ma@@ st@@ ik@@ rout@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone won the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osex@@ ual American woman , who won gold for an individual multi @-@ party event for women . &quot;
&quot; team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , won silver . &quot;
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but they do not see classes in the whole country . &quot;
Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie struck all the same way as A@@ ly and Madison , to create it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four gym@@ n@@ ists in the team . furthermore , it is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ nen is a more expensive sport and Turner will join the first line in private gym@@ nast@@ ics , which will be maintained by parents who are waiting for training , educational , travel clothing , budget and hotel costs ( for the trainer and their Turner and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ outs are in wealthy suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , Turner will get their entire training and this is for families a very expensive and long @-@ term commitment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer by Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have trained both her athletes since she started with the gym@@ nast@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; we have to be inspired by the municipalities Au@@ n countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , a more powerful and easier access training . &quot;
I founded my gym Foundation of 20 years .
&quot; in my events , we have offered free and affordable gym@@ nast@@ ics in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youth ( especially black and Hisp@@ anic ) and trained national and international winner . &quot;
&quot; in September , we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer high @-@ quality gym@@ nast@@ ics , which make the possibility of learning and benefit from this amazing Olympic sports . &quot;
&quot; power develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and identification of the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long advantages for health and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to be interested in the gym@@ nast@@ ics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to take part in the sport , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Madison for this real presentation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the Olympic team and thank you , F@@ ass you motivated so many young girls with different background to start their way , healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistance doctors would like to organise further strikes after winning Jeremy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers were hoping to termin@@ ate the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 per cent of the 3@@ 7,000 assist@@ ants who were able to vote on the vote . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hunt found plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS would split up in a &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; and that the N@@ HS would be harmful to the employees and patients . &quot;
the first assistance doctors should receive a new contract which contains changes to night and weekly training to improve the care of un@@ pleasant times .
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the President of the BM@@ A comm@@ ent@@ ees for assistance doctors shared last night in a communication with : &quot; assistance doctors have pre@@ heat to the proposed agreement as before serious concerns , in particular that it will inc@@ ite the current aging crisis and to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with just eight weeks , who still remain , until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts from BM@@ A to solve the dispute caused by the government to participate in the government &apos;s withdrawal and sometimes on the ear @-@ st@@ itious silence .
&quot; this was the case of speaking that Jeremy Hunt had made up last month until the last month , that his door would always be off@@ ended . &quot;
&quot; Jeremy Hunt must now act , lift the vibration and talk the concerns of assist@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; if he did not do this , it was obvious that the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to perform further labour measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of almost 13,000 ro@@ oper@@ ations and 100,000 stops before , as nur@@ ses and psychiat@@ rist@@ s were included in order to give doctors on the strike . &quot;
the ministers were hoping to complete the dispute over changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the British Medical Association .
&quot; BM@@ A would like to receive a better week@@ day ticket for the 5@@ 4,000 assist@@ ants to be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistance of assistance to the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ales said : &quot; &quot; labour measures do not reach any of the only little , but we have already loaded up the teams and service providers and prepare for the patient , nur@@ ses and their families only wor@@ ries , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the afternoon of the assist@@ ants and communic@@ ated with the Ministry of Health as well as other minist@@ ries answers to concerns about the concerns and W@@ hist@@ leb@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; employers hop@@ ed that the continuing positive commitment to other important issues - such as dis@@ embar@@ k , flexibility for training , training courses , mutual recognition of teaching , training courses , mutual recognition of teaching , training courses and the Ministry of Health regarding adher@@ ence to the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day @-@ drug that can reduce heart attack risk
&quot; thousands of heart attacks are prof@@ iting from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication , after the authorities recommended to submit more people for a longer period . &quot;
the anti @-@ inflammatory medicine T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with a heart disease .
&quot; the drug is prescribed for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stro@@ kes or a further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS regul@@ ating authority is recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regul@@ ating authority is recommended for four years to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and one quarter of these suffer from a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and stro@@ kes are caused by accumulation of fatty material into the arter@@ ial walls that make them stro@@ kes .
&quot; when the Bel@@ ag falls apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots that runs blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; if the blood cl@@ ots dis@@ solves , it can flow through blood flow and flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who had already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces the risk of making the formation of blood cl@@ ots un@@ more likely . &quot;
&quot; the opening draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 months intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ relative , followed by 60@@ mg , with twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health care centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all those who suffered a heart attack had suffered a heart attack or stroke - often with des@@ ast@@ r@@ ous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of one person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in the reduction of further heart attacks and stro@@ kes in people who had already had a heart attack .
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are happy that we are able to expand treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ l@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the design draft recommendation is not recommended for over this period .
Culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness leaves election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year on the release of a government report for corruption out of the office
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ness has resulted in the widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities , as a devastating government report revealed today . &quot;
&quot; the former Cab@@ inet committee Sir Eric Pic@@ kl@@ es pic@@ ks up the police , election monitors and Rath@@ geber to have evidence of electoral abuse regarding eth@@ nic@@ ities concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion . &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and municipal government , which is now an anti @-@ corrupt occupation , said that the in@@ ti@@ mid@@ ation of voters from religious moti@@ ves would be so bad that it should be allowed to protect the police , lock@@ ers outside of bal@@ ances to protect elec@@ tors . &quot;
he recommends that voters should lead a identification with themselves to prove their identity in elections .
at present a voters must only call his name and address .
&quot; the report proposes , not removable ink on the finger of a person , if they leave their electoral voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wer should get more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he calls for the press to have access to community documents and decisions from non @-@ official comm@@ ees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only against election fraud , but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial base culture that goes down , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by Do@@ wning Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets election campaign as in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the official Mayor of Lut@@ on Mayor for Rah@@ man should be corrupt according to a lit@@ igation against corrupt and illegal practices of his amber . &quot;
&quot; the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ n@@ ical manner , &quot; and that he had put his critics with rac@@ ism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; the Rah@@ man should have led his campaign on the basis , that it was the cor@@ related duty of Muslims to choose . &quot;
&quot; up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of a desc@@ endant , where one person cho@@ oses someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said that there was evidence in the whole country of dec@@ eit .
&quot; in particular , he expressed himself al@@ ar@@ ming to the frau@@ dul@@ ent post@@ code - with the older members of the Muslim community that would have made pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , depicted , made several recommendations to su@@ stain the electoral system , including the guiding of evidence to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; evidence was appropriate that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic min@@ orities were exercised , especially women and young people , in order to elect the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ic or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions had such a behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; sensiti@@ v@@ ities concerning eth@@ nic@@ ity and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to nurse the system , including the ban , that policy activists edit letters to stop &quot; &quot; reap . &quot; &quot;
the report produced by Ther@@ esa May is demanded even harder and tou@@ g@@ her registration checks to prevent the electoral directory of immigration and social security purposes .
&quot; consider , elec@@ tors in front of your choice after your identification . &quot;
&quot; not removable ink on the finger of a person , once they gave their voice to prevent someone cho@@ oses twice . &quot;
systematic reviews about the nationality of a person to make sure they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications on an automatic letter di@@ aling code .
prohibition that political activists process complete correspondence and envel@@ opes .
the police give the power to set off operations by election stations .
&quot; an amendment , which was an amendment to In@@ dict@@ ment according to the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Act 1983 ) . &quot;
photographer ban on electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in voting stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensive training of the training , to ensure that employees take the rule out that voters go alone to the voting cabin alone . &quot;
Sir Eric falls on the Metropolitan Police and finds it so amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case no criminal complaint was asked .
&quot; the electoral Tribunal called Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for corrupt and illegal practices due to corruption and illegal practices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; abor@@ tions &quot; of the Rath@@ geber @-@ registration departments of the Town H@@ alls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the trial in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears as the mother of par@@ liam@@ ents a proud heritage , but the wor@@ r@@ ying spread and conce@@ aled spread of some authorities threatening this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Dou@@ chan@@ son and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by the Olympic champion in Rio

&quot; but the 24 year old Olymp@@ ion@@ ik@@ in is far not the only one to have gold batt@@ ling athl@@ ete who has his own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not , if one should give the social media faith . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Rio Olympics in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a list of Olymp@@ ion@@ ics that feature more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood @-@ Hollywood times . &quot;
&quot; the Hunter and Wolf : team member of the US crew in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; except K@@ ates dou@@ bling on the bicycle race , many people on the Internet show how a certain arch@@ ers of the Z@@ dy@@ mus of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o could be . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US crew in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a ons@@ lau@@ ght on Twitter , after pictures , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street Star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the arch@@ ers got the mad@@ ness in the social media with and gave it to hear that he has already seen since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself see no great simil@@ arity , with the exception of the facial hair@@ y , &quot; shared Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a looking guy , so I suppose that was probably the compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular land@@ marks since London 2012 will undoubtedly come into the center : the sin@@ king simil@@ arity between the British broad@@ casts Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris .
&quot; the russian gym@@ n@@ in Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes should go through the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria E@@ ste@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh is compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison . &quot;
a Gang higher : this user is the view that Nathan the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor is
&quot; another lasting comparison was drawn between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal for Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova shows more than just the sun@@ ken skin and blonde hair like the actress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while American Nathan Adrian has attacked fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not only the only thing : a Twitter user was very happy that others are like the simil@@ ar@@ ities .
theory in the room : according to this user there is a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple may be a reason
Twitter U@@ ser@@ in explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope solo and Dex@@ ter actress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular not@@ ches Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the actress Laura Lin@@ ney , as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , that resem@@ bles her own beautiful , wide smile , that resem@@ bles that of Bring It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comm@@ ent@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers &quot; like &quot; called &quot; a sister died . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Byron Mac@@ Don@@ alds , that his microphone was turned off , when he finished his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m Fre@@ el@@ schu@@ eh@@ li . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ don@@ ald who was brought into the comm@@ ent@@ ator team of the C@@ BS , to give her &quot; color &quot; could say : &quot; this little 14 year old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the finish , baby . &quot;
&quot; excited like M@@ ief , like a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thanks for this .
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming pool 1 : 5@@ 7,@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , making it possible to reduce the gap to China . &quot;
&quot; spect@@ ator in Canada , viewers re@@ acted online after being sho@@ cked by the tone and language . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ met@@ t Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Did the C@@ BC comm@@ ent@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old flo@@ ats from China &quot; like a pig died ? &quot; ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot hasn &apos;t broken that they were still on the show .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described for women with the final 4 x 200m free styl@@ ish@@ ly designed for women : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the finish , baby . &quot;
&quot; the cr@@ iti@@ que of Byron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter came quickly and hard , with which many words were given to him &quot;
&quot; Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard , like uns@@ en@@ si@@ bel in Byron Mac@@ Donald &quot;
&quot; another Twitter U@@ ser@@ in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; Wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
it just shows the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like r@@ assi@@ sts . # .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel , who hosted the C@@ BC show , was broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze for a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate formulation , I &apos;m sorry that it happens . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the last 90 times , C@@ BC pleaded not guilty to the people who responded to the comment on Twitter &quot;
the comm@@ ent@@ ator of Scott Rus@@ sel had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze on the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ology at more than 90 other Twitter users who had compl@@ ained about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and gave a message .
&quot; we regret it that these statements were made , and that it was made possible to broadcast it . &quot;
last night we quickly felt at our spectators on the show and our followers in social media .
&quot; to clear one , Byron &apos;s comments related to the performance of a s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless they were in@@ adequate and an un@@ happy chosen formulation . Byron is doing what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon , Mac@@ don@@ ald was ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was not a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to take me for the comment , which I made after the women &apos;s swim in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I found myself on the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers and not to them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I &apos;m sorry for this . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ ged over woman who tried under@@ wear under@@ wear in the middle of the shop
&quot; the buyer did not know where they should see , when a woman went out her clothing in the midst of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , she mu@@ stered her , as she looked at it , and laid her back into the shelf . &quot;
you moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ h@@ osen in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
Pri@@ mark shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ stone in which the woman sam@@ pled the under@@ wear before they return it back to the shelf .
&quot; a mother of two children , Jenny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time at the shop , said that after the mysterious woman had tried the under@@ wear , &quot; she went back and left her business without buying something . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; in the middle of the shop , she took a pair of signatures from the out@@ lay , pulled off her own rhin@@ estones and tro@@ users , and tried them . &quot;
she did not even try to find a little dis@@ crete place to do it - she simply was there as O@@ sk@@ ar .
&quot; every star@@ ling , when they pulled down the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like it , as they once again put it into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three other sub@@ men , before she finally decided that you didn &apos;t feel right , again and went out . &quot;
&quot; it didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b someone observed - or think about the person , who would buy under the circumstances that they had tried . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; how to think anyone would take under@@ pants with home that had a different person and had not been washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson said : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees trying to draw clothes from the sale , after she went - what exactly is good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate it to go home with a new pair of subjects to go home and find out that another woman she had , and pulled back and not washed her . &quot;
&quot; Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident that happened on Tuesday , 9th August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were drawn from sale .
how to protect with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from arms attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke with Rh@@ one Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand@@ master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York to find out how to get around with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from front or behind , this video will show you how to rotate the sk@@ e@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; when you get back from the back , you should turn to turn right , so you can see your att@@ ack@@ ers and go &quot; from the Line of Fire , &quot; says Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the gun between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit it with your el@@ bow .
&quot; beat him with the knee into the ly@@ re and twist it , while the att@@ ack@@ ers beat down pain , the weapon out of his hands . beat him with the run into the face and move backward , while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; near att@@ ack@@ ers , which are approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the gun , grab the weapon and twist it , so the att@@ ack@@ ers can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the weight on the weapon and beat the att@@ acker on the chest , then turn the weapon out of his handle before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi pre@@ making .
but remember that it is with a rob@@ ber@@ y at the saf@@ est way to over@@ pass your money - as long as you are not a Kra@@ v Grand@@ master .
traveler Ian Wright sh@@ ab@@ t for a guide of his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British trav@@ eller sub@@ du@@ ed his immune system and dig@@ gers a serious test - by re@@ jects some of the dirty and ek@@ ar@@ rests locations in Europe .
&quot; the moder@@ ator and travel author Ian Wright , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k moved his course on a euro coin , a rail@@ ing on Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Cir@@ cus , a rinse kno@@ b and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before leaving each object , he used a L@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going on . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; brought some surprising results in daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the rinse kno@@ b of a draw@@ bar which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely sho@@ ck@@ ingly , but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of intestinal bacteria , as well as its own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he re@@ jects , more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines by moving through the world , as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations up to r@@ ins@@ ets of toilets , the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he told : &quot; already as a child , I was relatively un@@ worried about what my health concerned and I put all possible things in my mouth , earth , worms and sl@@ ump water . &quot;
in the film he was just born of his reputation .
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its pro@@ be@@ ard showed a lumin@@ ous count of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared with this , the lumin@@ ous number of fresh @-@ washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to ref@@ using after their lumin@@ ance rate was over 4000 units while fresh @-@ washed hands hold one of less than 60
&quot; Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , &quot; which shows the bacter@@ i@@ count of various places like the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says , &quot; This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing dirt than that !

&quot; the L@@ ick@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Strength , was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation . &quot;
&quot; the Company equi@@ ps master Wright with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ illi and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , juices and new categories N@@ iko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumer really something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating about watching and at the same time explains the benefits of Pro@@ biot@@ ics .
we led Bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended we told &quot; Let &apos;s call you Ian .
they claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon , and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information on an interesting way . &quot;
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the film directed , added : &quot; &quot; let me say , &quot; &quot; I have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I need to le@@ ak them , like the Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course there were things , in which it was easier to bring Ian to use them and others , with which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m happy that we recorded some of these dirty treats .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of respondents said to have exposed l@@ actic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said that they contain at least occasionally products which mol@@ ded l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destro@@ ys Del@@ og@@ ation Social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; a psych@@ oso@@ cial family left their social apartment after a delay with a damage amount of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and their partner Sh@@ aun Tre@@ ph@@ cock were thrown following a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they have been removed out of their estate , sho@@ cked employees of residential property with property in an ir@@ repar@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls have painted holes , wood chi@@ pper have been torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated on the walls . &quot;
the family moved to be moved and it is assumed that it is now living in a private accommodation .
&quot; Donn@@ a Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she is not afraid to repair the apartment . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was a great night@@ mare for people here and I am the view that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property is believed to be considered nic@@ er part Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and her reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment for a time and the police had said that the terror , who had joined the family , cover street fights with bas@@ eball , drug abuse , drug retailers and excessive scre@@ ams , spreading and flu@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in June , Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , got an arrangement for ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which will be demolished under circumstances , old mill was found . &quot;
&quot; in the property , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden di@@ ets are rounded . &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight her on the street and to be called the police regularly .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing ch@@ og@@ ated them and their partners this week for@@ cible from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to be voluntary .
del@@ og@@ ation were che@@ ered by lighten@@ ed neighbours who said that her life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They were unable to anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times that we tell the police here are incredible .
&quot; we could not sleep today , tomorrow . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not usual !
&quot; now , wherever they are gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it would have failed to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police has been called in regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
on the separate side of the town were tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that it disp@@ oss@@ oms the ten@@ ants to accept any responsibility for their behavior and her family , as del@@ ici@@ zation is always the last step , the Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
&quot; it was a very difficult case , because the behavior was extremely difficult and their actions to be terrible for their neighbours . &quot;
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the congregation , who have gone cour@@ ageous to us and have paid the information we have made . &quot;
I hope that this development will don@@ ate some neighbours and con@@ veys the message that ant@@ iso@@ cial behavior is not toler@@ ated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they are all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ ici@@ zation on the ground .
workers of the house administration will now have a tr@@ ash of land@@ mines that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis and orph@@ ages , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ ities and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don received a fine of the fin@@ er after being guilty of class B of a drug in commercial view .
&quot; she claimed that the money came for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who joined a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after being homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth . &quot;
many rooms of the house were gra@@ yed with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; police says that they are del@@ im@@ ed ten@@ ants , which do not keep itself to the arrangement . &quot;
&quot; Angela Cro@@ w from the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall shared with that the del@@ og@@ ation may be a clear warning to the other ten@@ ants , which do not comply with the arrangement . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can be beha@@ ved without self @-@ accus@@ ations , as well as those that were har@@ med by such a behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the police of Devon and Corn@@ wall will never toler@@ ate criminal and ant@@ iso@@ cial behaviour , which continue to work with partners to protect our communities . &quot;

&quot; the holi@@ day@@ care on , when they began to do so worried about the noise of the excess engines , without having to see what came to them through the clouds . &quot;
the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova in the vicinity of Av@@ eiro .
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of many holi@@ day@@ makers , who posted videos about the dramatic Fly in social media , said : &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would hang out . &quot;

&quot; surface fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , in which four people came to death on the island of Madeira . &quot;

also at 3 : 2 in the Pro@@ pri@@ al@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing .

bronze went to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ an@@ ani .
the two Chinese have managed it as expected in the final game and made the title each other .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would get the single title in the sign of the five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top of the top Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Leg@@ ion@@ ary ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left on the plate only , between the sets and time @-@ outs they had no co@@ aches . &quot;

Donald Tr@@ ump dreamed of ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the US rep@@ ublic@@ ans leadership is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive wor@@ ries , even in traditionally conservative federal states their majority . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now gave weakness of his election campaign in the previous republi@@ can plateau Utah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident m@@ ultim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concern , as correspon@@ dent reported . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals inside the race camp from the race , now the doubt grow on his success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have massive problems in Utah , &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump wrote before evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for assistance in important states like Ohio , Florida , or Virginia . &quot;
guilt are wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ ature and he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media .
republi@@ can stron@@ gh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ ling
Utah is usually a safe bank for the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tr@@ ump and his compet@@ itor in the Democrats , Hillary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; the other institutions see Tr@@ ump indeed , but not with the distance that are common for Republican candidates in the federal state . &quot;
&quot; as endangered , Arizona and Georgia also apply . &quot;
&quot; in an interview of the Sen@@ ders CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question as he would stop fighting Clin@@ ics : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and if back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
he doesn &apos;t do anything else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t rich for him on the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump continued . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party Tr@@ ump should have threatened to support funds to support his election campaign , it should not be able to present better handling values . &quot;
&quot; instead of having the candidates , use the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans to the Congress in terms of arms . &quot;
Olympia : three dec@@ eit at D@@ oping Test
the IOC aims to set up a disciplines of disciplines .
Ken@@ yan athletes threat@@ ens after the Second D@@ oping affair with Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Games .
&quot; following a fraud attempt at a d@@ oping control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a coach home to Kenya . &quot;
&quot; the International Olympic Committee shared , promp@@ tly to establish a disciplinary committee , in order to investigate the case . &quot;
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary was informed that the former Sprinter and present coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village had issued a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ metre @-@ L@@ eller F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i . &quot;
this is the team@@ work Ken@@ yan had been reported by D@@ oping Controll@@ ers .
the IA@@ AF world federation has requested information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations into a IA@@ AF narr@@ ator .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following steps of the IOC the IA@@ AF will make an assessment , &quot; it was called the IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the d@@ oping control station and has spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , gave the sample and signed , &quot; &quot; stated Ken@@ yan boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ credit@@ ation of the athl@@ ete who stood on the list of training checks of the world @-@ Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was over 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Athle@@ tics Company Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Olympics .
he should be informed of cash payments in his country on upcoming D@@ oping tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he is said to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi Airport . &quot;
&quot; at the IOC after numerous D@@ oping @-@ Ver@@ sions , Kenya has been under special observation since longer period . &quot;
&quot; during the announcement of the more than 2000 D@@ oping target controls before the Rio Olympics , the Rio Olympics were noted that particularly athletes from Kenya and Russia were taken into the visa . &quot;
&quot; prior to summer , the world anti @-@ d@@ oping agency had exercised much pressure on the African country to create an anti @-@ d@@ oping @-@ law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympia Center .
&quot; consequently , the WA@@ DA Kenya increased from the list of countries whose d@@ oping control is compliant with the WA@@ DA rules . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports , the ARD always compl@@ ained that D@@ oping @-@ funds are easily accessible in Kenya D@@ oping @-@ funds and there is a significant ment@@ ality of sports bet@@ r@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; the IOC member Richard Po@@ und called for last a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had employed them in Russian athle@@ tics Championships . &quot;
&quot; in this sport , it could be proved that in this sport art area and systematically respected . &quot;
Russia &apos;s athletes have been excluded from the summer .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; during the Shakespeare @-@ Year , the Salzburg Fest@@ spiele presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as tragic lovers of love , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
&quot; with this , a surprising Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli . &quot;
&quot; a Musical in Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director of Cec@@ ilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music , filled with the role of Mary . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra conducted by the Venezuel@@ an conductor Gust@@ avo D@@ ud@@ amel : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he war@@ ks . &quot;
we always say they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their pace and mel@@ ody .
it &apos;s a wonderful mix the perfect recipe for our orchestra .
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
in this st@@ aging Bart@@ oli plays a older born Maria .
she remembers her loving kindness with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascin@@ ated me .
&quot; first , because it is exceptional ! &quot;
and then Mari@@ as personality is still there .
&quot; she tells her in her song : &quot; I , the Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I produced Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so it &apos;s clever , of course also na@@ ive , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resem@@ bles me very , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
D@@ ud@@ amel is full of praise to the opera singer : &quot; Cec@@ ilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it &apos;s such a honour for us to work with her .
she is a very generous person .
and Bart@@ oli are giving the compli@@ ment : &quot; D@@ ud@@ amel is so an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a need for him .
&quot; one sees it in every one of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; : &quot; in this piece , it &apos;s about pre@@ judi@@ ces and fan@@ at@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; today we have entered the refugees at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ori@@ ans went to New York , and the New York residents didn &apos;t want to do it . &quot;
&quot; these are the same subjects , and they are just as strong as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
&quot; London School Children , which joined the IS in Syria , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sult@@ ana , one of three British school groups who left London last year to join the IS , reportedly died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the attor@@ ney Tas@@ n@@ ime A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that her family had learned from her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria several weeks ago . &quot;
&quot; it was assumed that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ er of the Group in the country , told I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; s@@ ult@@ ana was 17 years old , and died after her family &apos;s family shortly after she had left the war @-@ torn land and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good therein lies - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks to go into a war zone - people who have ever decided to meet this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , s@@ ult@@ ana and two other school@@ girl went down from the east of London to a plane towards Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
s@@ ult@@ anas family has been informed that she has married a ISIS fighter in Syria - and in less months a widow .

&quot; the Tre@@ ats Magazin work together with the photographer David Bell@@ em@@ ere , to release a 1970 @-@ year Pi@@ relli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 . &quot;
but instead of famous naked people you want to find out the next generation of Top@@ models for 2017 .
the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us this year that his N@@ eck magazine of Old@@ school Play@@ boys distingu@@ ishes itself as &quot; Play@@ boy for men . &quot;
I do this for women .
&quot; apparently , he is the view that the Calendar does . &quot;
&quot; we must return to the presentation of tim@@ eless and classic gro@@ u@@ ity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel &quot; inspired by these pictures of a female body , &quot; said Sha@@ w in a press release to the release of Cal@@ endars . &quot;
women are going to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their pictures online or personally at open cast@@ ing call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish church calcul@@ ates with mass destruction
&quot; who does not suit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the G@@ ülen @-@ near Foundation dialogue and the world , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in short term , the Kurdish community Germany anticip@@ ates ten thousands of protective seek@@ ers who escaped from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be &quot; several hundred thousand , &quot; the leader of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community Germany anticip@@ ates a mass destruction to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ oned with tens of thousands , medium @-@ term , with some hundred thousand protective seek@@ ers from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the min@@ orities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the leader of Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already covered a Kurdish flood after months ago , 500,000 Kurds in Turkey were on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the dis@@ astro@@ us p@@ utsch , the sec@@ ular and op@@ positi@@ onal ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will restart in Europe if they are still supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it can &apos;t be that a state that sees itself refugees in its own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the Chief of Staff compl@@ ained about the targeted regime of Syrian Arab in Kurdish , but also in al@@ ev@@ it@@ ical cities . &quot;
this means Erdo@@ gan will raise up the remaining Kurds on the remaining Kurds .
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks were exter@@ minated , even in the past hundred years , &quot; Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CDU member . &quot;
the Chief of Staff demanded that the federal government has positioned itself as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers .
also in Germany an &quot; wit@@ ch @-@ hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics .
I feel no longer in Germany for the first time in the last months .
the German branch of the G@@ ülen movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks are looking for asylum in Germany , especially Kurds and opposition . &quot;
the fire marking as G@@ ülen @-@ pendant destro@@ ys teachers and other ac@@ adem@@ ics .
&quot; who does not suit and Erdo@@ gan is engaged in packed suit@@ cases , incid@@ entally the Kem@@ alist and sec@@ ular , &quot; Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un said , Chairman of the G@@ ülen @-@ near Foundation dialogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Foreign Ministry , the Turks set the largest group of asylum approved in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; at the date of June 30 , this 11.@@ 386 people and there@@ with almost 29 per cent of all will have been justified ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves before war , poverty or car@@ el@@ essness . &quot;
&quot; asylum seek@@ ers according to the fundamental law are politically , i.e. from government side , individual reproduction . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
Sel@@ ts@@ ames Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the loc@@ als receive nothing from the summer campaign fighting - and the holi@@ day@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the country .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; the country election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays , the European Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more than ever , it doesn &apos;t matter : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ war struggle - which is bit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; the loc@@ als , which are to be convinced by the election workers , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most holi@@ day@@ makers on the road are on the road to Use@@ dom , Rü@@ gen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not loc@@ als allowed to vote on the country . &quot;
&quot; practical problems : in the holidays are hel@@ pers that hang posters , fl@@ yers , fl@@ yers , distribut@@ ing fl@@ yers , distribut@@ ing fl@@ yers and drop out at the end of the votes . &quot;
&quot; until September 4 , 2016 , the electoral and last day of the day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass through the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if one can tell , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CDU coalition , must fear his position . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clear behind the CDU . &quot;
&quot; exciting is very exciting , as strongly Ne@@ ul@@ ing Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition . &quot;
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , an almost un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive election campaign makes one of his major posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the land , ro@@ ses ro@@ ses and chat a little with the people , as it already did his legendary question Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors have cold feet and give Chancellor Merkel the blame for the bl@@ asting of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; We manage that &quot; I spe@@ eded up the rise of the sp@@ op@@ o@@ ists what will cost him out now . &quot;
&quot; the CDU with its top candidates , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has experienced , as it is , when you make the right place in the right place campaign for the wrong time . &quot;
she has been invited twice to Chancellor Angela Merkel ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag and Merkel lies in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Westphalia and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , was recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too sorry to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; apart from the usual bal@@ ances , Nord@@ ost CDU largely wai@@ ves the usual bal@@ ances on market places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbre@@ llas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , like Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; sub@@ ordin@@ ated role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the union also noted that , on the country , its base has to crum@@ ble that it must be very strict , again a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it is just like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : in the vast expan@@ se of the country is hardly available . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CDU elec@@ torate co@@ king on his fellow soldier is also self @-@ lar@@ v@@ ingly : &quot; you have to go where it is we@@ ary , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is on the game , Sell@@ ering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , S &amp; D Group reached 22 percent of the CDU ( 25 ) partners behind the CDU ( 25 ) and just below the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD still clearly won with 3@@ 5.6 percent of the CDU ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , small @-@ party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should be able to create the leap into the country . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtu@@ e from the holidays , and take advantage of an advantage in the Internet . &quot;
&quot; online campaign contest , &quot; says the President Claudia Müller . &quot;
otherwise green campaigns for searching for local stimul@@ ants go by holi@@ day@@ makers .
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ ek , the top can@@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and it is also nice . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is no punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 renovation : catering equipment suffer from blocking
&quot; at the speed of speed , with which the B 27 is renovated , there is nothing to compl@@ ain . &quot;
&quot; for the persons responsible for the construction work starting at 5.@@ 30 a.m. and end only at 20 o &apos;clock , there are always praise praise . &quot;
&quot; all of them did pretty well , El@@ vir@@ a T@@ etz@@ l is told by the Jet @-@ gas station . &quot;
this is a team team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south of the half , until the end of October will be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed is also the opposite of those responsible for the construction , approximately when it comes to the establishment of Beh@@ el &apos;s rides . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has ended on Monday to the south , and also the blocking of Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg has again relaxed and has relaxed the traffic situation within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now go on both sides by O@@ f@@ ter@@ d@@ ingen from the B 27 .
the so@@ othing traffic through the place seems to be rec@@ eded .
&quot; there were some considerable dis@@ comfort , &quot; says the Chief Executive Management of the office responsible for the restructuring management of Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach @-@ Road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , Haf@@ n@@ erst@@ raße and Wei@@ her@@ on had to fight with more traffic noise because many ble@@ aches were looking for and rather their Nav@@ i as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to some other trucks in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed lim@@ iting were not kept , the community challenged the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable quantity , &quot; says King who himself made herself a spot on the location . &quot;
there are already two to three per minute used .
&quot; at 77 hours , the fastest @-@ test was on the pace in the temp@@ o @-@ 30 zone . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been pulled on , but it became qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small sol@@ ace that it is now open to customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg .
&quot; in the cards , business people don &apos;t leave themselves . &quot;
&quot; but that the B 27 reconstruction has led to them with them on revenues , everybody is asking them to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some less affected are affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; which has produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation is hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; most slight decrease , &quot; but also dreamed of course . &quot;
&quot; the local , along the road , are tied along the road . &quot;
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öhn@@ er , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
not only him but all the guest rooms have hit &quot; hard . &quot;
&quot; customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil were missing . &quot;
we need to be happy with each Euro .
the turnover stood at &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot;
road en@@ forcement have thrown his operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
he paid half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been released , the policy would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Government President Jörg Schmidt on request by G@@ öhn@@ er , whether it could give a financial compensation , otherwise it would not have to benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now they also need the dis@@ advantages that arise through the renovation . &quot;
&quot; G@@ öhn@@ er knows from other coun@@ ties , where such a little more generous . &quot;
&quot; in all complaints , G@@ öhn@@ er is sure that his restaurant will continue . &quot;
&quot; finally , the family business has been located here since 17@@ 15 , refers to the long history of history . &quot;
&quot; because of the complicated public transport , other regul@@ ars now are less frequently subject to understanding , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t go , it is also very different . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the restoration work again , G@@ öhn@@ er has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öhn@@ er holds the effects of the B 27 building work on its clients for the largest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in her long history . &quot;
&quot; six months construction work , which is even brutal . &quot;
constantly being scre@@ wed in the name of the terror attack in laws .
&quot; following the recent proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now looking for a thick safety package . &quot;
but what has a Dul@@ ce status to do with Terror ?
and what does the coalition party say to all that ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the con@@ cili@@ atory .
&quot; all his proposals were politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister for his new safety package . &quot;
they are calling for anyone .
&quot; other , more advanced points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also stum@@ bled on this too .
but as the Minister of the Interior he was located on results and in a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able con@@ sensus &quot; within the coalition .
&quot; following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère was a little time to date , before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the republic . &quot;
but the more extensive are the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , told , that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ ck @-@ encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
this is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU direc@@ tives on air passenger data and arms law .
the call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies is also not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second call for proposals who did not have to do with the SPD : he wants to ban a symp@@ tom appearance for terror groups and jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these are difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CDU man &apos;s CDU man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he still keep doing this for reasonable and demanding nothing at the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas will be presented by Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they are partly in itself : he plans fast @-@ term deportation and more possibilities for detention of people in the expul@@ sion of deportation .
refugees who are fet@@ ched targeted in the country should check their smartphones and check social media accounts for security check .
&quot; at Dul@@ ce for cancelled asylum seek@@ ers , he wants to make some worse still worse than to date - such that off@@ ences par@@ don , or their papers consci@@ ously throw away to compens@@ ate their identity . &quot;
some of them is political and legal .
man@@ ches also works un@@ balanced and leaves questions open .
&quot; and with some points - at the ine@@ quality of thought , for example , the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differenti@@ ate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it cannot be expressed in speech that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees . &quot;
&quot; in addition , many people faced with the high refugee concerns about security . &quot;
&quot; and things which people deeply employed people , let not cut off in election campaign times . &quot;
the inner safety is enormous in the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the in@@ security is great .
&quot; and yes , there are election competitions . &quot;
&quot; Union and SPD are therefore increasingly becoming increasingly in position on the topic of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , it was high between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a gar@@ den@@ te dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some uni@@ ons @-@ interior ministers , also called a Bur@@ ka ban and a return of double citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also tired here to reconc@@ ile tones .
from a return from the double compass he hold nothing .
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
&quot; you re @-@ establish , do not make sense . &quot;
&quot; and when a Bur@@ ka ban , he wrote a constitutional concern . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally un@@ constitutional , and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partners , it must first show . &quot;
there is plenty of things to worry about dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently attemp@@ ting to pro@@ cure itself on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; first of all , the party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alizes in a brief conversation and says : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further to it . &quot;
Volkswagen is still coming through .
&quot; despite diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the supplier will advance worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it is running round .
&quot; in response , there are hosts around a term . &quot;
Volkswagen kicks off with deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some good running markets , Europe , Europe &apos;s largest motor makers can continue to make up an increase in spite of its many brands and some great running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , the brand brand launched VW , especially in Western Europe and loads the sale of sales , as the company recorded in Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the brand , sold around the world in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars and sold less vehicles than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , according to China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries increased by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; head of Staff Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann introduced the weaker numbers from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there have been a purchase of purchase in some core markets through &quot; modified economic conditions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , British vote for Australia refused to explain a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , where the exhaust gas rec@@ essed first , there is also a min@@ us to be@@ ech . &quot;
large support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; in total , the predominantly affected house stamp of the Lower Saxony is further gli@@ mp@@ ed by the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only one deliver@@ ance of 0.9 per cent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; from January to July , Group Chief of Staff Fred Kap@@ pler could further prove a sales plan from January to July . &quot;
&quot; in this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide to 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software system .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW calls for re@@ armament to the workshops around 2.5 million vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in the course of re@@ armament , VW re@@ iter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after re@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deteri@@ oration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine capacity . &quot;
&quot; the bus stop for the customer after the retro@@ fitting a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , &quot; but do not say of a &quot; guarantee , &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate circles . &quot;
reason are legal host@@ ility .
&quot; the &quot; Focus , &quot; reported that Volkswagen granted to his German customers now a guarantee for the diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed on last Monday VW @-@ Represent@@ atives of the Federal Foreign Office .
it was confirmed that this meeting was confirmed .
&quot; VW has completed the editions of my investigation Commission and the KBA customer . &quot;
&quot; variations of this is not accepted , &quot; declared Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the warranty that for fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor performance after the retro@@ fitting have no deterior@@ ations unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen himself uses the term &quot; guarantee &quot; but not as it was in corporate circles .
&quot; at the long term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility that customers will come to a workshop for example , for example , half a year after conversion to a workshop - and that could lead to the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in terms of customer interest , it is important to avoid that any other damage caused by the g@@ ob@@ sc@@ andal to prevent fail@@ ures regarding possible warranty claims , as it was called . &quot;
therefore we don &apos;t use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see is demanded by rich austerity in the future - as the second Institute in Germany .
&quot; chief of the banker Josef Paul , on Thursday , said : &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who par@@ ked about 40 million euros in Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy . &quot;
the German banks of German banks speaks of a single fall and sees in it not a signal : normal austerity would have to be afraid to pay for their savings rate .
&quot; to store banks money over night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay a 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank G@@ mund comm@@ ited from September from private and corporate customers for deposits over 100.000 Euros in Gi@@ ro@@ - or daily monetary policy .
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will cost $ 400 in the year &quot; , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he has been waiting for some 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day on the other , and that he could not dec@@ eive . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 per cent costs , &quot; said the head of the banking . &quot;
I cannot place for any million 4000 Euros .
the cost is now pointing out after the off@@ ending principle .
&quot; the cash of the Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank would be too dangerous : &quot; I haven &apos;t experienced four convic@@ tions , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! , &quot; said the banker . &quot;
most clients have had understanding and changed to other assets .
only few mig@@ rated to other banks .
the Bavaria &apos;s cooperative society stated : &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; it alone can be worn , &quot; &quot; business is not possible permanently . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account , credit cards , or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with interest rates for deposits from three million euros , the Thuring@@ ian People and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enbank Al@@ ten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , Chief Executive Officer of the banking Federation , said : &quot; we do not expect to pay a surface offering for deposits , to do so that the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is too much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see , give it a clientele , which is a bit more luxurious from the property . &quot;
&quot; that can be a problem for a small bank , if it &apos;s free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , R@@ ott@@ ach @-@ E@@ ans , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no further banks are known to the cooperative society of Bavaria , &quot; spokes@@ man for inser@@ ts of private consumers , &quot; spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June the President of the German People &apos;s Association and Rai@@ ff@@ eis@@ enb@@ anks ( BvR ) , Uwe Frö@@ hlich , declared : &quot; the threshold of the negatives go to the negatives , is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; the competition is hard , and it imp@@ ly the migration of investors for the competition . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , customers in Germany are not allowed to fall in the width . &quot;
destination plates : who actually buys records ?
lon@@ ely men middle ages love records .
&quot; before you come to the comments in order to ski@@ p him under the p@@ seudonym Non@@ Al@@ le@@ En@@ sam@@ ic men &apos;s age with rough ins@@ ults , this statement leads from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the most discussed recovery of records does not focus on a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als which we want to welcome the unity of physical objects , but due to mid @-@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all pre@@ views at the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most prob@@ able buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ by@@ ists - it has an emotional meaning : older platforms reserve her feelings rather to themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it time to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , I would follow the camera while in the middle of a bust@@ ling road in So@@ ho run , a humble gray suit , before I stand , my hands hold and something to determine how : &quot; so let &apos;s throw a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s throw a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of So@@ H@@ os slowly lies on his charm , hotels , restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers are located - there are still a hand@@ ful of fantastic land@@ marks . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera to the next part in which I am up close to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stuart from Glasgow , 55 , whom I am from Sister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle ages ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number : eight men of middle ages , one woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I wonder ? &quot;
&quot; I guess it already says , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; these sound panels , pictured above ( he sent me the snap@@ shot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , dress the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles , is the result of his available income : it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy records as they were not able to buy them when he was young and ple@@ xed . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy , are out of the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things , where I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s true to those who buy records , rather intro@@ ver@@ ted , and likes to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke , and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my truck .
&quot; We@@ z , 25 , who works with Sister Ray , also believes that many customers that he meets with the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medi@@ eval , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and to buy themselves back their old records . &quot;
&quot; of the talks , which I have led , people usually have ended up in 1998 or 1999 by their collection . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of followers of the record revolution of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to recognise that record shops offers a so@@ othing community of equality .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers took the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world , and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted sound@@ disc envel@@ opes from objects that watch happy Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void , or possession of material possessions to be a kind of consol@@ ation , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is by me as collectors and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal with spiritu@@ ally .
&quot; we are like their social worker ! &quot; sol@@ dered a staff of a platform .
&quot; a survey of IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month , have not yet heard them . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a turn@@ table that they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a plate , don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
at this time of news report I would probably look very worried while I bl@@ ink through a stack to Bos@@ sa Nova compilation .
&quot; J@@ onn@@ y , 42 , who works at sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle ages ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone recently joined here and said : &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a radio head plate , so I &apos;d like to put it into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it is definitely happening . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musicians . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; those are younger people , not old who will go slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ opp , which has devoted to the sound of the record nearly a whole floor , has an underground audience when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , Teen@@ agers and women &apos;s average age . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts : latest syn@@ thes@@ ia and sex@@ tary pop instead of experimental jazz dr@@ ens from the loud@@ speakers - is it good to see such diversity in customers .
&quot; none of them looks very strange , but na@@ iss@@ ile psychological trau@@ mas are hard to be fixed if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; El@@ an@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a couple of minutes , and considered the variety of plates which are used for sale . &quot;
she is rather a sho@@ cking pump than a wholesale store .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so the collection of records are not real option , says it . &quot;
it costs much .
&quot; it &apos;s easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
&quot; my last stop is a business , which is said that a new generation of record lovers will be inspired by Urban Out@@ fit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; while I admit that je@@ ans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young te@@ ens who can group for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Cro@@ sley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ eh@@ ouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; nobody can see it - perhaps because they are only pure decor@@ atively , some so far above that it is impossible to deal her . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send to the depths of So@@ H@@ os for more , there is nothing to compl@@ ain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my research studies revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave at least in record shops in So@@ ho , the large number of female collectors and plate lovers , who exist in reality , record shops and in On@@ line@@ ages . &quot;
these people are probably working hard in school or offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not by record shops in Ber@@ wick Street and leaves across plates , while they avoid the rigid ga@@ ze of an un@@ c@@ anny , 30 @-@ year @-@ old present@@ er that rises above the shoulders of no middle aged men . &quot;

French court ref@@ uses to offer demol@@ ition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais jungle , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week , authorities in Cal@@ ais assumed that the state should be fug@@ iti@@ ed to sell 72 of cigarettes to energy drinks , sell hair@@ dresser services or tea for 50 cents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in pro@@ vis@@ ing restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Cal@@ ais pre@@ fecture argu@@ ed that these places should be broken down , because they would be paid up a parallel economy from which no tax would be paid , which would be paid for a fire and annual risk of fire . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups divided the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups , not enough food for the growing numbers in the camp would offer . &quot;

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s R@@ aser must be set to the next generation speed measurements : in different states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash units are tested specifically to over@@ run the Tem@@ pos@@ th@@ ier . &quot;
the fut@@ ur@@ istic effective En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example in accidents that would be dangerous for a mobile measurement through the police .
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ it@@ ating bridges , there are often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with a stationary bladder to ensure the limit of the speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile installation can be dangerous or consuming .
the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days when the case data are transmitted via a modem .
&quot; with laser measuring technology , all vehicles can also be recorded simultaneously through several tracks . &quot;
&quot; variable speed lim@@ iting , as well as departure time after time , driving strips and vehicle class can also monitor . &quot;
&quot; in the highly dangerous condition , one can move the trailer with each car with a trailer hook . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply tuned , it is lowered in the measuring mode so that the wheels in the mo@@ red and by the way also van@@ ish the safe outer sleeve . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to information from Vit@@ ronic in different states and now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities are also fl@@ ashing with the new technology : recently , France has made 100 pieces of Geor@@ gian , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
&quot; Britain brings silver in the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by , after Fiji have picked up Master@@ class Gold . &quot;
&quot; the impressive performance of Great Britain at 7 @-@ time ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening to a stop at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated in Rio in the De@@ eper Stadium here in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in Fiji gained a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back @-@ back , line @-@ up and ro@@ her strength to win gold - their first Olympic champion of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was failed by the silver medal in the silver medal - Great Britain &apos;s fourth to that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in that tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the significant defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall in the final . &quot;
&quot; but in fact , Fiji had defeated a 15 @-@ man team in the form of a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but will probably not be that at least a gold medal for his neck will be hanging around his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is manager Ben Ryan , former head of England in Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind them .
&quot; eight years ago , they lost to Ryan every game at Adelaide Sev@@ ens . &quot;
they just lost one here .
&quot; this fl@@ ap will we@@ do , but the progress is amazing . &quot;
&quot; in Fiji , the GB@@ S attacks had fun off . &quot;
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell and co . an , as one would run into driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went out in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he turned . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB barely cli@@ pped the ball .
&quot; a fier@@ y tape of Mitchell stopped the mountain from Mann Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to get a third goal , but it only stopped in Fiji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a took a touch down in the right corner and stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
&quot; Nak@@ ar@@ awa has added a new since the restart , and there were still over one minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pre@@ paid through a further weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it is as if I was born in Fiji to play the 7 , while Britain is still studying . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and ended the fi@@ ji@@ ic gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half , until Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova ran after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan N@@ ort@@ on started an attempt on GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game ran long in favor of the southern t@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang and d@@ anced at the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the play@@ ful approach in Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame used the i @-@ bag with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ st@@ le sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is dar@@ ken@@ ed and the UK f@@ aked in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the days Fiji had defeated in Japan in the semi@@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 rounds , and Britain urged South Africa in a tight semi @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Great Britain conversion of difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ k in the first half of the front , but Dan N@@ ort@@ on broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate under the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant tac@@ kling from Marcus Watson , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning through fighting with the cancer of the trainer for rowing victory
there will be no engine empty gold than those playing and that wants to be hot .
&quot; from the first stroke to last , 220 hard h@@ ie@@ ve , who enter into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional importance in her golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it were only the Bei@@ den sitting at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all@@ present as they came to the second Olympics in succession , the first women in the history of British sports that were putting on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ folded use , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant Ath@@ let@@ tering , that reflect on the surface with the elegance of s@@ warf , which does not reflect the kind of the tri@@ um@@ ph@@ es . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in the rowing , a bat@@ a@@ illon is to consent to the hel@@ pers that make the difference and it was no one more useful than the coach who would not survive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do it , he spreads out everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it changes a bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had good luck that he could be treatment early in early 2014 , outside the season , which could begin the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better back soon . &quot;
it was an inc@@ entive .
&quot; I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough . &quot;
so it begins .
&quot; the rowing is already a challenge , but that makes it even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the in@@ forman@@ ce@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a winner in the morning to talk more than anything else and tried to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; St@@ anning , who was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery regim@@ ent in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wreck this week . this is perhaps somewhat extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats me how much I mean , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t have a massive thank you . he &apos;s the best coach in the world . &quot;
I could not have a better person for coaching or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have no race in the last five years .
&quot; the pair had a hard rhythm , with which their opponents could not keep up . &quot;
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
Helen called &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important to get rid of it .
&quot; we had a good start and at the same time , we were not looking out to make something great . &quot;
&quot; we wanted no fireworks today , we wanted to achieve a good result , going out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; bells must appear next week at a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took approximately six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
exempl@@ ary for 31 years for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one Group , &quot; R@@ upper@@ t G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the Association is considered &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
a small fr@@ ing@@ ed drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
so it was some time ago in the original piece of the Bavarian Radio .
&quot; little later , the Water Forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia declared the Pur@@ pose of the Pur@@ suit . &quot;
the work of the V@@ eit@@ enst@@ one group landed &quot; Bavaria far as exempl@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; behind all this is the Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who had been working for 31 years , 28 years as managing director . &quot;
he was now retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose unit of the V@@ eit@@ st@@ ine group with headquarters in K@@ ott@@ endorf , Municip@@ ality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 150@@ 000 cubic metres of water and supplies 32 places and ham@@ let with about 5500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; affili@@ ates are the churches of Kirch@@ hain , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current President , Breit@@ brun@@ ns mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d B@@ ühl ( FW ) , remin@@ ded that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was set up in 1985 as a water wart and was appointed as Managing Director of the Pur@@ suit Association in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; its tasks are very diverse and they extended from the water management and maintenance work through office and maintenance work , the budget collection , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets at weekends , &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , the restoration of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the reconstruction of a central computer management ( 2004 ) , and the reconstruction of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no stand@@ still , and I have always taken new improvements , because water st@@ ats and drinking water the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in their foli@@ age ratio , she praised G@@ ö@@ ll@@ ers , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he used himself with a lot of heart bl@@ ut for his water @-@ purpose and he has lived the water @-@ purpose federation , as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks ago , as a real practition@@ er , he may present the chance of success to nit@@ rate from the Water Forum of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
he received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öller praised the well @-@ led water wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel who worked together for 28 years .
he is the best water @-@ keeper and he was a faithful Kn@@ appe .
&quot; together , we were an unbe@@ atable team . &quot;
as highlights from his point of view he described the well @-@ construction and re@@ structure of the twin business .
&quot; however , the most difficult challenge and the most difficult use were the quar@@ ry at Kirch@@ lou@@ der at a 3rd of January . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night is to work with water , so the towns with water could be supplied . &quot;
&quot; as well as the supply of Neu@@ brunn I have only maintained only once again , because you filled the reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hat@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; the management of drinking water @-@ purpose Federation was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer , Lau@@ ter , who is following the successor of Ru@@ pert G@@ öller . &quot;
&quot; the soprano Anna Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko is open to the aut@@ ism of her son Ti@@ ago , and turns to other affected parents : &quot; you must have the courage to talk about it . &quot;
&quot; medicine has made significant progress , &quot; said the 44 @-@ year @-@ old of the Italian newspaper &quot; Cor@@ riere della Sera . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the disease was recognized by their son , they believed they had to die . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the meanwhile eight @-@ year old Ti@@ ago had come well ahead and learn to find privately in New York , where it is the best therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; in order to give an example : if I am asking him something about what two years , when I sang along the Milan Scala , he remembers nothing , &quot; said Net@@ re@@ b@@ ko . &quot;
but he is the happ@@ iest person on earth .

&quot; the man called us , and given us to have shot his li@@ fel@@ ess , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator is on the run , after him will be public . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Sven S. could be on the way by car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,80 meters tall , muscular , brown and has a gl@@ at@@ ze . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
but it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man carries a gl@@ at@@ ze .
man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could carry out the weapon with themselves , so the police . &quot;
anyone who sees Sven S. is to call 110 .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victims was born in 1988 , the perpet@@ rators in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; initially , the police in Lübeck would not want to do any information regarding the T@@ ather@@ gang or the relationship between perpet@@ rators and victims , but she confirmed that a man was killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing deli@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; we do not say more , &quot; &quot; said a police officer in Lübeck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special police unit ( SEK ) was a crime scene . &quot;
steel - flash@@ back for German steel industry
the ris@@ ky and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains sp@@ ared from additional cost in million@@ aire .
&quot; financial bur@@ dens , which threatened the industry from the green energy funding , are of the table . &quot;
&quot; during the liberation of the renewable energies situation in the German steel industry , Mr Gabriel ( SPD ) , President of the German Federal Minister , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , said : &quot; West German General Zeitung &quot; ( W@@ AZ , Friday edition ) . &quot;
I &apos;m really glad that we finally reached the negotiations for two years .
&quot; according to the European Commission , the European Commission initially planned to ask the steel manufacturer that use gases from high @-@ furnace power generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry associations , the steel industry used additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the W@@ AZ . it is now a fundamental certificate with the EU Commission to talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when generators to be replaced in steel plants , an EEG lev@@ y fall from 20 percent . &quot;
but this will not be le@@ vi@@ ed in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed the agreement of Germany &apos;s agreement with the EU Commission for its own production .
&quot; thus , the status Quo &apos;s status will largely be ens@@ hr@@ ined . &quot;
very special meaning is the successful completion of Gabriel for the steel industry .
with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; is that a first step .
&quot; others need to follow . &quot;
&quot; IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann stated in Frankfurt on the reform of the emissions standards , &quot; stated IG Metall boss Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has suffered under over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation in China proved to be the world &apos;s largest producer in China , in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand for strong steel on the global market . &quot;
European manufacturers t@@ oss chin@@ ese steel gro@@ d@@ umping .
&quot; during this spring , the situation has relaxed . &quot;
&quot; to show an omin@@ ous import tari@@ ffs on import effect , for others the economic prospects have been raised in China . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is un@@ clear how sustainable the price over@@ h@@ aul is . &quot;
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp remained c@@ auti@@ ous on Thursday .
and last the prices were stag@@ n@@ ated again .
the sector respon@@ ds to difficult position with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp still wanted to not exclu@@ de any individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , German steel manufacturers remain c@@ auti@@ ous despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less steel than in the previous year , as the Steel Community was ha@@ sten@@ ed on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced lot went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production increased by two percent below the previous year . &quot;
the association anticip@@ ates an increasing order situation in the coming months thanks to an improved order situation .
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing seniors good &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has already accompanied her whole lives : when she was a young girl in the school choir , she finished the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a senior female choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels good , cheerful and a total of living , says it . &quot;
&quot; in the way , they do something good in their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is equal to several perspectives . a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German senior league . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the choir , we share the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular merge , seniors can link and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; for frequently solving social and family structures at the age of , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in their choir : &quot; to arrange and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of coll@@ ision . &quot;
singing can be lab@@ orious in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , seniors have a deep and controlled re@@ spiration . &quot;
&quot; whoever calls his lungs regularly , is not so fast in everyday life as fast as the pu@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to get the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on elderly people , singing often has a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Labor group of the Seniors Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , the joint singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life both in school and free time , it explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening of songs in older people often aw@@ akes many memories , often connected with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; through lyrics and particularly melo@@ dies , people themselves de@@ pressed themselves to long @-@ lying events . &quot;
&quot; when singing , the head is asking a special achievement , says L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on the own voice and on a pre@@ defined rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cogn@@ itive challenge . &quot;
&quot; elderly people who live alone , do not practice themselves to concentrate solely on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one passes through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler writes . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ este@@ em is also growing through singing in choir .
&quot; to show yourself : if I do long for something , I will get better and watch over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with singing , so there &apos;s enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he thinks little talent , advis@@ es L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you do not sing alone - with 50 sin@@ ful people , who hears there if a sound goes on it ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the appropriate offer , seniors various possibilities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; somebody is singing from the famous circle in an older ench@@ y@@ man , you can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views on cho@@ irs in the surroundings .
&quot; if you want to sing in a church choir , you can directly turn to the church or the church . &quot;
many senior friends can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; anyone who has no access to the Internet can ask friends , friends or neighbours with the help of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; who lust has to sing , should definitely be connected to a choir , advis@@ ers H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
sing the soul well and has something be@@ ating - this is true for every age .
cats react sensiti@@ vely than a tom@@ cat on scre@@ ams of young
bi@@ ologists have examined which effect the rowing of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ys has grown on adult animals .

female C@@ ats can detect the reg@@ ression of Kat@@ z@@ enb@@ ab@@ ys at the che@@ wing of the little ones .
&quot; they react to ten percent faster on Lau@@ te of K@@ itt@@ ens , which are found in big trouble as scientists have found out of the Medical College and Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) . &quot;

she is the first author of the study published on this Friday in the magazine &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams are distinguished with the gl@@ ing@@ iness of its help . &quot;
a total of nine adult males and eight crew were observed from the livestock of MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played at a little of little ones , taken away for three minutes from the litter box and were separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;

the researchers keep their results in spite of the low sample for sa@@ wing .
&quot; all females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , responded to the cry , &quot; said Con@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they beat faster to the loudspeaker when this ruins of the very cher@@ ished kit@@ ten played .
this ability may be born or developed developing sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males re@@ acted at all , &quot; said the biolog@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already examined the reactions of women and men on baby noise . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to babies , regardless of whether they were mothers or not , reported the biolog@@ ist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski runs with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ b@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former Football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ b@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a terrorist group of terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey will be an important soccer game in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the Arch@@ rival between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul around the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya , the official line is unique : &quot; business as usual &quot; is predicted . &quot;
&quot; already in July , the government &apos;s departure after the overthrow in July , the government , which should not be imp@@ acted by the standardi@@ zation , should not be imp@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not apply to those who are suspected to belong to the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen movement , which is responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , even before football is not content . &quot;
&quot; against the former Star@@ k@@ icker Hak@@ an Sü@@ b@@ r , the Prosec@@ ution filed an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in the meantime , South America , South of America , is accused of being a terrorist group member . &quot;
Sü@@ ver should be the followers of Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah G@@ ülen he was responsible for the coup attempt by President Recep Tayyip Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; true for 90 days of exceptional circumstances still valid until October , actually the life of most Turks , however , does not have any effect on the life of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; in public places throughout the country has declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like all the country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the members of the President .
&quot; in view of dramatic experience in history , the Turks , however , is the strict re@@ jection of military coup . &quot;
even the fans themselves - no matter whether their heart beat Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ victorious &quot; Gala , &quot; he will return to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Cologne in the past season has proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first time as a top@@ sc@@ orer of his association . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory buffer .
the newspaper &quot; Fan@@ atics &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best of the place . &quot;
he has finished the season in an excellent way and secured his crew to the cup .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion was a reconc@@ iling conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the Pre@@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; also say early in the Europe League early . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g there was only one to rank six .
the season was not good .
Pok@@ al was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas ran better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who had the 26 season finale as the Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ z@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; in doing so , the AC Florence had sent under the contract and in Bes@@ ik@@ tas can only be returned to the coup attempt , due to the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; quoted the magazine &quot; K@@ icker &quot; &quot; Chef F@@ ik@@ ret Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , the storms would have to be ready to aband@@ on around a third of its € 7.5 million estimated annual sal@@ aries , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; its salary at Florence , we cannot pay . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals in Rio Olympics
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old Justin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice for D@@ op@@ ings ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ ano@@ wa may not start in Rio .
others persu@@ aded Athle@@ tics sinners can laugh at that - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic D@@ oping definitely determines the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics in Rio .
the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa who had compl@@ ained after a D@@ oping @-@ lock your starting right before the games was entered at their start ( 100 meters chest ) mer@@ cil@@ essly and blo@@ oms out .
it was a qu@@ ir@@ ky scenery : with a lifted smile she was still proud of the hall and prov@@ oked her appearance .
&quot; as a rule , they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out in a che@@ er tower . &quot;
but there are still many other sport@@ s@@ men who go to the start of the Rio Olympics in spite of the D@@ oping past .
here is an overview :
&quot; Justin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 m season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was locked for D@@ op@@ ings for two times ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and Ex @-@ World runs even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 metres in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered to be the greatest challenge of Us@@ ain Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m Season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 after taking the taking of the pain by Oxy@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after a surgery , she defended a severe pain , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympic champion of 2012 , world championship in 2013 and European Championship was positively tested for meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the lack of in@@ gest@@ ion and was locked up for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws in this year go to the account of the big gold fav@@ ored .
&quot; La@@ Shawn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 m season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two time World Champion over 400 m , was successfully tested for 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
a means to penis enlar@@ ging was responsible for Mer@@ ced Mer@@ ritt .
this year the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 metres of the world &apos;s fastest man in the world .
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ smith , Belarus ) : probably hardly any athl@@ ete were identified as many medals . &quot;
&quot; so Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title in 2005 nine years later , after having been diagnosed with testosterone d@@ oping . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 for ster@@ oid @-@ d@@ op@@ ings and the EM title in 2006 because of testosterone abuse . &quot;
&quot; due to an judgement of the 2008 Olympic Games , the Bron@@ z@@ em@@ e@@ da@@ ille was the result of a verdict of the International Criminal Court CA@@ S . &quot;
with 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked number two of the world ranking .
&quot; Liu Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record and gold fav@@ ors have been tested positive in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , not@@ ices of a banned supplement of food was found , the sperm of the world anti @-@ d@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA fell mil@@ de and ran up already on July 13 . &quot;
bomb horror in Thailand - Austria viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al deaths
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand , with the woman in contact , said S &amp; D spokesperson on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered inter@@ sec@@ ts and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left this back again . &quot;
they planned their home trip to the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Phu@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are just un@@ clear . &quot;
&quot; the State Department is free of engagement with local authorities , such as sn@@ u@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; located around 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok H@@ in , Hua H@@ in was initially explo@@ ded on Thursday night in an area of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai police have been killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning there were two explo@@ sives , so according to the authorities a further person was killed . &quot;
&quot; also from Phu@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; at Det@@ onation near the popular Ba@@ dest@@ ab@@ ran@@ ds Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured by police officers . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani in the south @-@ east coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded on the south @-@ east coast of the country . &quot;
the explo@@ sives would have gone into the air according to the authorities in a flor@@ ist in front of the prec@@ in@@ ct of the coastal police .
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and Ch@@ um@@ phon on the Southeast Coast were several injured . &quot;
&quot; they went from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hua H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same manuscript , &quot; said army gener@@ ously Dan@@ ai Krit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday @-@ early journalists . &quot;
we assume that it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself on possible moti@@ ves - however , it is likely to have the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of mus@@ li@@ stic separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; on the other hand , Thai police declared that the terrorist attacks are not related to the Islam@@ ist insur@@ gency movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ ot@@ age , limited to limited territories and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is estimated that the bombs of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities received intelligence agencies in the south of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed about the exact date and the places . &quot;
&quot; yet , the group is still un@@ clear , which group is behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; police ev@@ okes its civil servants throughout the country to rein@@ force security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment area . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they usually do not judge against tourists . &quot;
Hua H@@ in is a palace that was used for years from Thailand &apos;s King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after reason of reason , the Austrian Foreign Ministry recommends the Austrian Foreign Office to make the instructions of Thai security agencies . &quot;
&quot; high level of safety ( safety level 3 ) gel@@ ding for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ lian and its en@@ vir@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; after disp@@ utes between security forces and Muslim populations , there are not necessary journeys to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( safety level 2 ) gel@@ ding for the rest of the country .
&quot; on Thursday and Friday , there were a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution of the military jun@@ ta . &quot;
this happened to the military in the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta leader and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ o @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to hit chaos , while the country moving towards stability , improvement of economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military in@@ ta , which had taken power in 2014 after a phase of bloody crimes , with@@ drew itself to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not have succeeded in getting a grip on the country &apos;s extrem@@ ist insur@@ rection in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have been killed in the conflict .
&quot; just a year ago , there were killed 20 people in Bangkok in a popular Hin@@ du shr@@ ine - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloody attack in the country &apos;s younger history .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is going into the visor of the Federal Office for constitutional protection .
&quot; according to several national governments , the constitu@@ ents have also set the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; ident@@ ities Movement &apos; conservation points for efforts against the Free Democratic Reg@@ ulations , &quot; &quot; said Constitutional Affairs Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate , the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic faith or the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist way . &quot;
therefore we observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group of French roots , which has also been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Multi@@ k@@ ult@@ i @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass migration &quot; and the &quot; loss of own identity by su@@ peri@@ ority . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Federal Constitutional Court in nine states - Bremen , Bayern , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thuring@@ ia - observe the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; already . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Ma@@ ate said his authority to vote closely with the offices . &quot;
&quot; groups like &apos; Ident@@ ity movement &apos; try to fet@@ ch their target group where she stands , &quot; &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; generally , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to speak with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the acts of Islam@@ ists as well as sp@@ ies .
that is not a perfect advertising for your own business .
the propaganda must speak emotional .
young people are sus@@ cep@@ tible in particular .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , there had been reports from several German states about contacts of the &quot; ident@@ ities &quot; of Af@@ D policies . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have insights . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this type are only relevant to a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain people who are extrem@@ ist to change their destination and so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; decisive is , therefore , whether such persons have the impact on the party . &quot;
this is not recogni@@ zable .
&quot; overlooking the significant increase of criminal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seek@@ ers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ ate , he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have found in recent years that there can be right @-@ terrorism structures .
there were the &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can certainly be that further rectangular groups or small groups form the attacks against asylum seek@@ ers , against refugee camps , or attacks from other right @-@ right moti@@ ves . &quot;
a Germany @-@ wide or European management of Recht@@ ster@@ ror@@ ism is however not recogni@@ zable .
the previous groups were created on regional level or social networks .
&quot; they worried about that , Ma@@ ate expressed that many of them went to the account of people who did not appear before the right scene in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ r@@ ying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ icious attacks on asylum seek@@ ers were not known as crimin@@ als , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed off@@ ences that had already had legal gu@@ ardi@@ ans with right @-@ examination , who were perhaps politically in@@ different or , for example CDU , SPD or left , which then radic@@ alised himself by the right @-@ right mood . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
not always determine the head@@ lines or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the cour@@ ageous appearance of RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics center , the lightweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia so slowly that he could no longer see in the TV pictures . &quot;
he just disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transferred to the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished its predecessor with a return of 48 seconds and finished the 59@@ th place of 59 starters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just sporting figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start@@ law from the international swimming pool .
this is distributed to make swimming in the different countries more familiar .
&quot; as in ae@@ op@@ ies , most athletes run , Hab@@ te wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ B@@ EL Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nickname made the round .
some media recorded him as &quot; RO@@ B@@ EL of the W@@ al . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; made him funny about him in re@@ jection . &quot;
&quot; his time , he only struck with a minute and nearly five seconds on the 100 metres of Fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also pulled .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete in a pre @-@ run over 100 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; by then , Mou@@ ss@@ am@@ ban@@ i was fired at the time . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old spent eight months before the Olympics and had never completed a long distance before the competition .

tr@@ ump sees the dro@@ pping elections not so narrow
Republican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump talks at a campaign event in Florida .
&quot; with the election to the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has already had an alternative video . &quot;
then he was going to leave on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November that would be either fl@@ aps , or I have a very , very nice , long holiday , &quot; &quot; said the candidate of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in a telephone interview with the US television channel CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it wasn &apos;t rich for him on the end of political correc@@ t@@ ness , this is fine , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; so he described the US President Barack Obama and the candidate of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within its party , more and more resistance prevail . &quot;
mail rises in the trade with electric transporter
a electric motor vehicle of the German Post in Action .

&quot; soon , the Group wants to start trading with the transporter . &quot;

&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he had said in late July . &quot;

Gf@@ K @-@ Leadership takes place in dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the Consumer Research Group Gf@@ K de@@ es his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the return cuts came suddenly - but not surprisingly .
the difficult situation of the market research owned by Gf@@ K announced that the chair by the Chief of Staff Matthias Hart@@ mann is even more uncertain . the longer he will remain the promised successes .
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research group Gf@@ K : once again dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the resignation of business management is the global number five of the industry in front of a person@@ alised new beginning .

who will be le@@ ite to market research in future is still un@@ clear .
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ heads , it was on Friday , at the last time the dis@@ appointment of the continuing successes of years derived from re@@ structured restructuring . &quot;
since 2011 Mr. Hart@@ mann has been on the Gf@@ K tip .
&quot; but the fruits of re@@ structure are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; said it . &quot;
&quot; in view of the last poor Gf@@ K business numbers , each participant will be un@@ quiet sometime . &quot;

crash@@ es - bus sli@@ t in Kr@@ um@@ cro@@ n in Gr@@ aben : eight months
&quot; in case of an accident involving 43 senior citizens as passengers , on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ ni ( district Aur@@ ich ) eight people were injured . &quot;
&quot; two of the passengers suffered serious injuries , divided the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old chassis of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to their information , had to devi@@ ate from the opposite L@@ aster , which took part in the opposite way . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right from the road and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokesperson for the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , the persons were unable to leave the bus , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire@@ man freed the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and ambul@@ ances came to the accident at the state road 2 .
the last trav@@ ellers were brought back to the Kr@@ kon@@ no@@ isse@@ urs district of Pe@@ ws@@ um by a Lin@@ i@@ enb@@ one district .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
investig@@ ators urged the load drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic meters of wast@@ e@@ water will be from October 1st , 2016 for the area of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros . for Z@@ ult@@ enberg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ opp 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the latest in Az@@ endorf , san@@ itation fee will then increase once again if necessary improvement for improvement . &quot;
&quot; after a relevant calculation , the wage rate in Az@@ endorf is at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as Mayor of Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was determined by the hom@@ olog@@ ation of the house through the Coun@@ cill@@ or Kul@@ mb@@ ach that under@@ run these san@@ itation systems . &quot;
&quot; due to the right foundations , the market Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the cost @-@ covered facilities . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens and industrial companies from Wel@@ sch@@ enk@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , L@@ opp , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Z@@ ult@@ enberg are forced to seize on the pur@@ se . &quot;
the wage increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as managing director Herbert Schmidt on the board , there was a re@@ calcul@@ ulation of the fees for se@@ wage plant in the market community . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , excess or under@@ cover from the previous cold period are excluded . &quot;
&quot; with a very low waste water san@@ itation , Schmidt founded the gra@@ dient blo@@ ating increases by relatively small establishments with a very low waste water wast@@ age , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for repairs of several thousand Euros would be gra@@ zing . &quot;
&quot; in addition , se@@ wer@@ age is slightly decl@@ ining in all three plants . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the past calculations , there were not least three units last due to their age and rep@@ airing and repair expend@@ itu@@ res in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the facility in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Z@@ ult@@ enberg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ opp almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt proves that in the se@@ wage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be exchanged due to damage to damage .
&quot; in the p@@ umping head , the almost 20 @-@ year @-@ old funding plants had to be over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed and for almost 20 years of operation of the first sep@@ tic tanks , the se@@ wage s@@ lu@@ dge has had to be installed in order to comply with the water legal specifications in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; to these extraordinary expenses , the continued maintenance and maintenance costs came into account in the new calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which at previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 is clearly below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that during low water san@@ itation , the expenses for the operation and maintenance were fully ex@@ pressing . &quot;
&quot; thus , Schmidt , supplem@@ entary Schmidt , has remained the market town of great entertainment costs for se@@ wage plants over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the af@@ ore@@ mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ ari@@ ous , especially since the supply area of the waste water @-@ purpose of me@@ es@@ enb@@ os@@ al is not able to expand this facilities because it concerns de@@ structive facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria ends for the first time in 8 months of inflation
National statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July 1 % was on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year , when positive 0.2 % have been posted . &quot;
the annual average wage of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell by clothes and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances , and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices remained as pre@@ mon@@ ate in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education remain unchanged . &quot;
snap@@ chat &quot; An@@ ime &quot; effect as Asian caric@@ ature crit@@ ici@@ zes
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is inspired by anim@@ e , but some ob@@ servers say that it is uns@@ en@@ si@@ bly opposite breeds . &quot;
&quot; with his filter tool , the Snap@@ chat allows around 150 million daily users to change reality and to play with ident@@ ities in such a way that borders already the Ab@@ sur@@ de . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into an pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that might be from a Roy Licht@@ enstein paintings . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ poll@@ uted , unique @-@ forming tools that generate more than 30 million dollars a day . &quot;
all mis@@ appearances arrive to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have dra@@ gged a cr@@ iti@@ que in the past where they were accused of prop@@ agate the Black@@ face / white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; as a few users of Uzbekistan today proposed a filter which gave them sl@@ ot@@ ting , false teeth and che@@ wed che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; j@@ aun@@ dice . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they asked whether this repet@@ itive contro@@ versy was sent to a bigger problem , that the company has di@@ spar@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; the news and indig@@ nation were widely used on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mother@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat reported that it had de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an exc@@ use : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a caric@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced rac@@ ism , the filter remin@@ ded of viol@@ ating c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others decided to take the e @-@ mail comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail Grace Sav@@ ap@@ ani , a kore@@ an American art student , whose T@@ we@@ et had been widespread over the photos that the filter &quot; viol@@ ently and were said un@@ pleasant . &quot;
they added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the counter@@ ing of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caric@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not coated , but that the yel@@ low@@ y is pulled down into the extreme extre@@ m . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural heritage .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in endless diversity and integration efforts , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all keep in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats big audience young people - who are in the breed of diversity as their older opponent - could be more likely to expect sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; if one of the Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters a picture produced , it is much more difficult for users to remain un@@ noticed when it was the case earlier , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu decided that , as a product manager and engineer , Z@@ hu decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that breeding @-@ related contro@@ versy has a lack of diversity in the setting practices in Snap@@ chat . &quot;
Z@@ hu critic@@ ised the big part of white only male leadership and ended its attachment with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ g@@ Snap@@ chat .
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Snap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures for diversity of its workforce and shows its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , Snap@@ chat refused to discuss the cultural back@@ grounds of his staff , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a personnel managers that focuses on under@@ lined population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu said that it will be closed its Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; &quot; I wonder if they need more user like us to say that this is not o.@@ k@@ . &quot;
military Shi@@ ra@@ ging ISIS secret service information provided committee on the Congress
members of the United States Central Command changed down@@ ward information to draw a optimi@@ stic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria as it would have allowed the actual conditions on site in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the republi@@ can members of the Armed Forces , the Intelligence Committee , and the Wehrmacht leadership , reported by great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Services , who reported their ass@@ essments in the fight against Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; Central Command , short C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ ampa , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; News Service information provided by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com Com@@ man@@ de@@ ers typically addressed a positive picture of the US efforts against terrorism than it would have allowed the actual conditions on site , and were consistently positive as analysis of other news services , quoted a newspaper article published . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is un@@ acceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses will be presented to our political leaders , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republican member of the House of Represent@@ atives , is established . &quot;
the guide defect in Cent@@ Com range until the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed in @-@ depth problems in 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct clu@@ es on that government pointed out below Obama , it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre @-@ law , a optimi@@ stic picture from the threat of Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , comments and statements were significantly more positive than the facts presented to the congress . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com members were publicly announced that a military return of the Mos@@ ulate could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city of Iraq , continues to remain under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republican Congress from Kansas , expressed in a opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the mid @-@ year 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the main leader of the Central Command changed the down@@ ward intelligence reports to record the danger by ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans called the Task Force to live after them , that analysts are worried about the manipulation of reports to Islamic State . &quot;
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights during the investigation .
&quot; in addition , further investigation of Cent@@ Com reports are in progress by the Ministry of Defence in the Ministry of Defence . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday released their own findings that coinci@@ ded with some of the Republican Task Force conclusions .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com ruled an over@@ ly restricted process for the creation of down@@ ward business ass@@ essments in Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , &quot; the highest @-@ level Democr@@ at Council , a member of the House of Represent@@ atives in the House of Represent@@ atives , was known in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , was delayed the release of down@@ ward reports , &quot; &quot; Moral by analysts and &quot; gave excessive attention to different opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Schiff and the Democrats , no clu@@ es on a cra@@ dle of the White House in Cent@@ Com analysts have found in regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot; &quot;
preliminary results of the investigations of the Congress were published on Tuesday through &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported investigations into the Pentagon by the Pentagon , according to Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; Lt@@ . C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Evans , a press rele@@ asing of the Pentagon , gave no reports on the Congress that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress during the investigations of the General Inspec@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; but he also said that &quot; experts sometimes have quite di@@ fer@@ mented opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the news services and the Ministry of Defence is a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
&quot; investigations have carried out the effects of a successful pneumatic campaign by American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion , which is now made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the alleg@@ ations of the past year have thrown the question to how far President Obama can rely on Central Command for the Military Operations of the Military Operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of disc@@ ord of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com Analy@@ st , Gregory Hoo@@ ker and the recommendations of many analysts , as the former government below George W. Bush and saw some time referring to the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insur@@ rection against the current reporting on Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team around Mr. Hoo@@ kers according to government states that contrary to the statements of the government &apos;s arrest , no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group had taken no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group because these pro@@ vis@@ or@@ aneous refin@@ eries had taken place to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this realization was not published yet , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s &apos;s command@@ ant commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was crit@@ ici@@ zed by members of the legislative elections due to its excessive estim@@ ation of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
General Austin went to retirement in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US won fourth match in the field @-@ hockey field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with great Britain before &quot;
&quot; a day after they shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two goals for the American field@@ ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually be a memorable achievement , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said they could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I don &apos;t belong to people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , this is what they know : the Americans are 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are in@@ clin@@ ched to the British in their group , who remains un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will hit a match on Saturday in the last game .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which the two teams will finish in their group from six teams , each of the first and second place . &quot;
&quot; the first placed will take a little bit longer out of the way , which lead the other group . &quot;
&quot; as always the game is going to go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e through their success story , four years after having landed in the past London Games at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time three years ago a Ho@@ ck@@ ey@@ ra@@ cket in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the National player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
they missed the Olympics in 2008 because they could not qualify for the Ka@@ der .
then came the year 2012 in which for her and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year , Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the National Team and thus began to apply things better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ around in London that we have now .
we can pl@@ uck the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the cake in the first half of the game with a set@@ back out of the clos@@ eup .
&quot; India had gone into the game without victory in the game , but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the game stand from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
she completed a Sprint with the flat ball on the left fl@@ ank and then moved into the middle and lu@@ pped the ball into the gate to pro@@ cure the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 lead .
Mel@@ issa Gonz@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the door@@ ke@@ epers of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on Saturday &apos;s next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the tramp@@ ol@@ ins &quot;
&quot; wherever you are too late , too , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s events will feel consistently and un@@ avo@@ id@@ able , a for@@ mid@@ able relay transfer between competition and stre@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; it is , as the Olympic tor@@ ch itself is a burning rod , which will protect his s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes as a s@@ wimm@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; you cannot place the TV , a newspaper read or listen to your neighbours in the qu@@ eue , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ cover@@ y , or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Log@@ an Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s s@@ warm of dimples , would certainly have been sent to Prime Time that would have been sent to Prime Time , where he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Turner or even f@@ real . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline . &quot;
the Olympic flame is not lit every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow , are the sports that are not generally accepted : aerial pist@@ ol @-@ shoot , ar@@ chery , bad@@ minton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the chest swimming and may rule over long .
&quot; but if I have modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the dis@@ crete charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ ers have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years it was so spar@@ sely perceived that many people I had questioned did not know that it is a Olympic portal . &quot;
this could also be regional ignor@@ ance .
&quot; although the USA has sent athletes to competition , it has never gained a medal in the trampoline and had a athl@@ ete until 2012 . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women to share for women .
Dong Dong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ Lenn@@ on from Canada will defend her gold medal in London this year .
&quot; the tramp@@ ol@@ in@@ jump has a certain outdoor char@@ me , partly because it sounds for the un@@ explained ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ School as those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a poor enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ wanted impact , but also the Gra@@ zie of gym@@ nast@@ ics and diving , the two sports that brings it essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means so much means &quot; jumps . &quot; &quot;
&quot; conqu@@ ering winner jump on an enormous trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements ( turning , real and sal@@ tos ) before they landing at the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad , you will be evaluated according to execution , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes of 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts hop@@ ed in their quest for gold , faster , up above and above , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , down and down at the bottom of the playground . &quot;
&quot; they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall , but also a further cav@@ ity : that of the world or the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the targeted battle is no@@ bel , ad@@ mi@@ red , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator . &quot;
but it is also what I would need to look at the listen@@ er of these games as something .
&quot; of this , the trampoline offers an breathing time . &quot;
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is top .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or her pr@@ une off , seem@@ ingly heavy e@@ ast@@ ron@@ aut as an ast@@ ron@@ aut goes upward , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly again . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no cur@@ bs into the distance , only the dre@@ aming , elegant up@@ lift of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and final of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13.00 @-@ Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also around 13.00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate en@@ dr@@ ens as part of an afternoon block at two days from 14.00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia it promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably over@@ looked in general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the consciousness levels can only be reached by the att@@ acking and the lenses of male athletes , like the male US Turner first proposed to the The Wall Street Journal - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base to be new fan base . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long Another ally of the United States &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , who demand political changes in Ethiopia , strug@@ gling for violent opposition of the government . &quot;
witnesses say that they were killed protest@@ ers during cl@@ ashes with the police at Sch@@ uss@@ ers .
is Ethiopia just going to go together ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally to the west with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests against the government sho@@ ok the country and spread in more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med on roads and several fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the answer of the government was merciful . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen were shot dead and killed un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security training young people have to strike , while they were forced to make a hand@@ held against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country and future becomes even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa , the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous land of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror over the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if anything , get so much Western help . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s economy expands in considerable pace . &quot;
its infrastructure has dra@@ stically improved - there is a new p@@ end@@ al march in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the roads are usually calm , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; if Ethiopia was anything other as a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , although dis@@ sidents were effectively transferred to silence . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile , or sent into prison , or driven into the wilderness . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and have no other options except protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
&quot; there are numerous complaints , which cover everything from the land use up to the lit@@ igation against power of the ruling coalition . &quot;
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching election last year , the ruling party and its allies have the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , ten@@ sions climb along the border with Er@@ it@@ rea ; a battle for this h@@ ack@@ y , controversial line called for hundreds of life in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts are afraid that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ g@@ aden , who were more or less forced on the past few years and could be armed with turbul@@ ence . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ ration after years of cra@@ ck@@ el@@ essly explo@@ de under the surface now explo@@ de .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in the last few years , many Ethiop@@ ians were able to communicate via the social media , as cheap smartphones were always more common and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government lock access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do in regular intervals , especially in protests , many people still can communicate via Internet Pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they stop . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave that they were so at protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ nic@@ ities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; since Ae@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who mainly come from Ae@@ gean , predominantly Christian high@@ ways , in politics and economy , while they are exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are living and in low@@ lands . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordin@@ ate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the largest protests were held in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia un@@ fair is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military , in the intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was up to his death on an un@@ sealed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical gen@@ ius , a man who was thinking about corners . &quot;
analysts predic@@ t that he was especially pos@@ ing in it to perceive early signs of dis@@ content and use special contractor to make opponents and they are un@@ harmful .
&quot; according to the current regime , Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; said Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen from relatively un@@ clear reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am came from the south as Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia . &quot;
analysts predic@@ t that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tig@@ ray controlled security services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an u@@ pro@@ ar in 2005 , after thousands of elections were protest@@ ing , according to the authors published by the government , apparently by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following Raz@@ icia , many protest@@ ers were killed , even if it were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new P@@ end@@ ler@@ k , as well as for their measur@@ able progress in the poverty line . &quot;
but obviously this does not prevent the Inten@@ si@@ fication of the internal mis@@ concep@@ tions of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , protest@@ ers attacked protest@@ ers in Gon@@ dar , an official city owned by Tig@@ ray and hatred for the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in social media . &quot;
analysts predic@@ t that protests die the US and other Western allies into a pec@@ uli@@ ar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights to the neighboring Somalia , even if they recently been informed that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West is definitely trying to support democracy , he doesn &apos;t want to coinci@@ de his ally in a vol@@ atile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; Mr. Ab@@ di said , &quot; &quot; is a very thin &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his asser@@ tion Obama was founded ISIS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m . &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to scatter the last contro@@ versy on Friday that surro@@ unds his campaign by affir@@ med that his repeatedly repeated statement , President Obama and Hillary Clinton would have been the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State of Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication submitted new questions to the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , whether he is able to communicate clear and understand@@ able with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings its fel@@ low@@ soldier , which make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful period of protection , in the actual position we must explain what he could not mean . &quot;
&quot; after having made the suggest@@ ion at a election event held on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump lodged in relation to the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really does not intend to interpre@@ t President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS . &quot;
but Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was simply sar@@ c@@ astic in a morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday .
&quot; the contrast , unlike the previous day , on which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation perfectly serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio present@@ er Hug@@ h He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tr@@ ump , saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS wanted nothing to do with the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism spr@@ inkl@@ es on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while he tried to draw the focus of his campaign because of falling read@@ ings to the economic situation . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton kept talking to Michigan in this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this subject . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he had found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July , he attracted strong criticism as he thought that the Russians should bring Mrs. Clin@@ ics emails , however he later said &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return to rowing .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test , such as certain messages of his fans will arrive , as they arrive , and then , if necessary , &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert , who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testimony v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in various ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of dis@@ shar@@ pen@@ ing the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump hasn &apos;t accepted a corro@@ sive sound because his re@@ frac@@ tures were further decreased . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , who was published on Friday , showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump generally tries to exc@@ use itself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he accused his critics often to contra@@ dict his statements or to understand his hum@@ our . &quot;
&quot; but as he reinforced the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps she@@ ds have brought his loyal co @-@ dispute into the un@@ comfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ant his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudolph W. Giuli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tr@@ um@@ ps most prominent princip@@ als , gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in an CNN interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitim@@ ate , political comments , &quot; &quot; Mr Giuli@@ ani said to the correc@@ t@@ ness of Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps . Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that Obama was going to ISIS an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back@@ ben@@ cy , completely wrong and so it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most of the mainstre@@ am rep@@ ublic@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , it allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East into control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump made his attacks on the media and designed them to ride in every of his words , and to be bi@@ ased against him . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ fied the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; TV experts who try to understand and said , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot;
some of the Democrats sp@@ ired over Mr. Tr@@ um@@ ps ap@@ ologies than just another evidence that he was in@@ appropriate for the presidential office .
&quot; once upon the price of the market p@@ ushes , Café in Green@@ point comes back &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a ashamed café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which was not able to pay Wi @-@ Fi but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from the Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front was pushed . &quot;
&quot; So@@ ap Ch@@ erie &apos;s shop , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in cup@@ cakes form . &quot;
native people immig@@ rated as last loss in one of the gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I can &apos;t believe that C@@ BGB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and now is a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , it is also new inv@@ entions . &quot;
&quot; a restored Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new version has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similar atmosphere . &quot;
coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old cafes , owner and managing director of the new cafes . &quot;
he started working at Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; as a customer offered a client to make money for a new accounts , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez , 36 , kept much . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same espresso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment with them .
he brought new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu , sand@@ wiches along with bacon and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ations such as cap@@ ers and saut@@ é@@ ed onions . &quot;
there are nature dishes .
&quot; the café serves no beer more , there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ guez said that he noticed a st@@ aked stream of old tri@@ bal customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also pushed through Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg and visited the ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; after being drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; after the Ver@@ b closed , she gave a while for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that it was at the coffee and the culture in the ver@@ b that pleased me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a Bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea in this day instead of the usual iced coffee maker , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
&quot; he went there before the work , and ordered not always the same . &quot;
&quot; I came to seven days each day , as a s@@ wis@@ s watch and they prepare my double ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ guez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal gets still his usual order , but sometimes it changes its Everything @-@ ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he didn &apos;t miss a groove on it that the soap shop has taken the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie actually offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee maker as ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will enter into our offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; the café also accepts the traditional , Polish inhabitants Green@@ points . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to Polish and Rodri@@ guez , he said that he will soon leave her , so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill the cold baked coffee in the bottle and sell .
there is a chance that the café has expanded to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new bag is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer , and said that he was destroyed by the ground when the café closed . &quot;
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the Lok@@ as and the purch@@ aser felt as a new coffee as a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his ascent to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roosevelt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a g@@ our@@ mets , President Roosevelt had a Fai@@ thful for refined Del@@ ic@@ at@@ essen the Fifth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de Fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Maryland Wass@@ ersch@@ il@@ d@@ kr@@ ö@@ ten@@ soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was somewhat more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pur@@ ée and as a dessert a p@@ ud@@ ding p@@ ud@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with people , &quot; said Jane Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; the last book of &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was written by Chinese cuisine in the United States , while Z@@ iegel@@ man explained in her book &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at the Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sandwich Shop for dinner , a small , car@@ rot snack at Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has already been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ iegel@@ man , 54 , ordered a cream cheese with Oli@@ v@@ enst@@ ad@@ chen , while co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with potato pur@@ ée and vegetable salad . &quot;
&quot; when rep@@ orters ordered h@@ ack@@ y , this found the pair for a discussion on the meal in the era of great depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man . &quot;
there was pean@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap prepared the ingredient .
&quot; imagine , as many peanuts eat that they serve them as dinner . &quot;
CO@@ E sm@@ iled fl@@ att@@ est .
&quot; it must have been laid in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years prior to the Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women collabor@@ ate for male Fel@@ ites , and it was freshly baked past@@ ed for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans that sent away food during the first World War . &quot; &quot; A Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is characterized by the ways with which the country went with it , no longer the Schl@@ ar@@ aff@@ enland . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food was a central , fishing theme , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was ban@@ ished : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and K@@ asser@@ ollen have been laid to base agent , the casserole as &quot; wonderful type , food remains re@@ ampli@@ fied , &quot; then Z@@ iegel@@ man , as qui@@ che un@@ appe@@ ti@@ zing ingredients were able to hide under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by low @-@ priced dry ob@@ st .
&quot; flesh , which was the focal point of the American kitchen , was rare in a rare luxury . &quot;
&quot; pec@@ uli@@ ar bl@@ ends were tried out , as a low cal@@ orie rich and nut@@ riti@@ ous satisfaction was in front of taste or even healthy cuisine . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Z@@ iegel@@ man prepared a dish from this era , baked onions with pean@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Z@@ iegel@@ mann continues : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pean@@ ut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the house@@ keeping .
&quot; as ever before or since then , domestic appliances - including Louise Stanley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by adding recipes and articles published in newspapers and journ@@ als , they encourage women to become &quot; budget sp@@ ol@@ ition@@ ists &quot; and the challenge to turn paste like creamy sp@@ aghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified . &quot;
&quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; is a feast of historic treats .
&quot; in particular , the reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizens , as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me cake food post@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa peas@@ ant cuisine of his kitchen , he sp@@ ans like the one million@@ th man from the world to whom he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucum@@ ber , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in a nearly gilded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderful realistic .
&quot; perhaps President Roosevelt should have committed the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to out@@ fit it with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , a house@@ keeper with no interest in flav@@ ours by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the bo@@ red food in Washington , but also one of them ready to prepare . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of great depression , to deal with food , was dis@@ car@@ ded once the country came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , Z@@ iegel@@ man said , as well as science was applied to foodstuffs . &quot;
&quot; in writing the book , the couple was better understood by the book the eating habits of Z@@ iegel@@ mans wife in law - for example , as they did not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
brick was remin@@ ded : &quot; she really made people sick . &quot;
there was the rest of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared away at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they went and cover a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ au@@ m@@ end , the president Roosevelt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Z@@ iegel@@ man and added that there was a common trick , a modest recipes to be missed . &quot;
&quot; there was no designed cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everybody di@@ pped a spo@@ ons in the fenced , brown lim@@ bs . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly , it was not bad . &quot;
CO@@ E repeated an sur@@ ge three times .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he set his own life to the game to help others : Khaled Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khaled Omar devoted his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save the life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died with a blo@@ o@@ bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a Civil Society , which according to the image newspaper has saved almost 60,000 people so far . &quot;
29@@ 00 Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers put their own life to the game to pull people out of the bom@@ bed houses and to afford first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the Civil Guard that shows him in a 11 @-@ hour rescue from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians facing the shining symbolic figure in the horror of war .
&quot; as heroes , however , he has never seen himself , said according to the image : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save lives , I think God looks in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; just before Omar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have four façade bombs at the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlor@@ inated gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that no children may play with it , quotes the image his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Greenland : the oldest cycl@@ ist is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland ha@@ ie usually come to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship &apos;s vessel S@@ anna .
&quot; he was born in 16@@ 24 and swim with a 1 km / h , through the North Atlantic - until today . &quot;
Greenland ha@@ ie received only 150 years offspring .
&quot; they swim in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic in an hour , in an hour he reaches an average of 1,@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it comes to it , the five metre long animal acceler@@ ates on a wh@@ opping 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Rob@@ be . &quot;
this kind of lon@@ el@@ iness @-@ shaped lifestyle seems to be a sponsor@@ ship for a high age .
Julius Niel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the professional journal &quot; Science &quot; anyway of a Greenland who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; mad@@ ness , &quot; commenting on the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock , the Max Planck Institute for demo@@ graphic research in Rostock . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist presum@@ ed for a long time that Greenland . &quot;
only the evidence is missing .
&quot; Greenland ha@@ ie are difficult to observe , finally they live mainly in the ice @-@ sea from Canada , Greenland , Norway and Sp@@ it@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive in the surface only in winter . &quot;
researchers have very little to know about the lifestyle of Greenland &apos;s ha@@ ie .
&quot; her time bends breath@@ less her , when they equi@@ val@@ ed six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; this shar@@ ks make this shar@@ ks anyway : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a Rob@@ be , another had swallowed up the ja@@ w bones of a young king@@ doms . &quot;
perhaps they hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the iron ore and search for Ka@@ da@@ ver who tor@@ ches up from higher water layers after bottom .
&quot; Julius Niel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a by@@ catch of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centi@@ meters long , while the largest 502 @-@ centi@@ metres is measured . &quot;
to determine the age of the animals evaluate it with the Carbon @-@ 14 method the lens core of shar@@ ks .
&quot; this centre of the eye lens arises from the birth of shar@@ ks , which contained in it no longer later . &quot;
the two smallest shar@@ ks had a lot of Carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; after the early 1960s , their birth should lie in the late 1960s when atomic tests experiments greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , with 220 centi@@ meters length of the third smallest animal , the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , which is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all bigger Greenland @-@ shar@@ ks had a normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities , which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 watch for a 4@@ 93 centi@@ meters long Greenland was an age of 335 years while the record @-@ shar@@ k should be even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ females can then get offspring when they are longer than four meters , it was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to arrange the length of the length . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centi@@ meters , probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined 156 years , Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
that is likely to be the world record for vert@@ eb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ es live mainly in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 211 @-@ year @-@ old Greenland @-@ whale , caught on the neck of a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught on Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to low temperatures , the body of the animals live on austerity gl@@ aze . &quot;
&quot; so , later , they tires slower . &quot;
&quot; in order to keep warm in cold water , the animals are often particularly large . &quot;
because the volume increases much faster than its surface due to the animal heat .
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on , as soon as possible , as possible as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the evol@@ ution@@ ary biolog@@ ist . &quot;
a very big animal should rather invest its resources in a long life .
building site in double pack
&quot; with topics around B@@ auen , the Council has focused on the most recent meeting at the latest session . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the panel received the communication by Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently exhibited housing can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the plot and purchase requests are clari@@ fied and the applications on survey@@ ing , the sale of the plots in the housing areas &quot; street route &quot; and &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; ( area Bin@@ der@@ straße ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the blo@@ wers in the rural marked and quiet residential community Schö@@ nau young families and ru@@ sty elderly alike .
&quot; as it was called , Bau@@ ma can report immediately in the town hall , on the awar@@ ding of the plots is expected to be cons@@ ul@@ ted in his September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to provide further requests to the res@@ ett@@ lement of further industrial companies , the Council decided to re @-@ emerge only in the spring of this year to be re@@ designed in part areas . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Sub@@ time lar@@ n , the commercial area has already been expanded by two plots towards State Road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the City of Main is therefore competing in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg in order to attract new jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt has benef@@ ited most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins , Head of the Compet@@ ence of Financial Markets and Real Estate Market of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after a Bre@@ xit , it is uncertain whether money will continue to operate from financial transactions throughout the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it has so far been approval in Britain . &quot;
this is just big US banks .
several banks have already announced to leave jobs .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ ist &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; expects some 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro@@ zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European insurance view E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the organization for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) have made its headquarters in Paris , but this is less important for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the not@@ ebook is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in Luxembourg , a large fund of fund , but as well as Dublin at the infrastructure are worse . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; further , the city with easily available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it &apos;s not that easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial real estate is 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt also offer higher quality of life than the competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of management consultants Mer@@ cer , the city ranked 7 , Luxembourg at No. 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris on 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if life of life is a question of pre@@ ferences : &quot; with its strong position as a financial centre for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; says the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; London , however , will remain the most important financial centre in Europe despite Bre@@ xit . &quot;
&quot; in fact , according to the numbers of Landesbank Hel@@ aba , there were about 14@@ 4,000 people working in the banking sector at the end of 2015 , there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs from the hepatitis C patent stre@@ it with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a U.S. official meeting decided that Gilead Sciences Inc aim , entitled to the re@@ funds of the legal costs , which are created from the Hep@@ at@@ its C legal dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was liberated from damages amounting to $ 200 million for the infr@@ in@@ gement of two patents by Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with block@@ bu@@ ster drugs of Sov@@ al@@ di and Har@@ v@@ oni , after a US judge conce@@ aled a pattern of mis@@ conduct on Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ ei@@ des and other inhumane acts . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was filed on Thursday , U.S. official in Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said Gilead will be entitled to put the costs incur@@ red during the defence of the F@@ alles . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to attract Gilead to the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can cure more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained to each other as Gilead and Mer@@ ck took possession of laboratory studies that So@@ fos@@ bu@@ vi@@ r failed , the active ingredient in the medication of Gilead . &quot;
&quot; from the USA , troops supported troops to reg@@ ain control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; from the USA , troops supported the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after having left the last IS fighters in the city , a spokes@@ man for the group said on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the extract of the remaining group of fighters that have dug within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they released over 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stage from the fighters as host@@ ages , shared Shar@@ k Dar@@ wish to Reuters the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council with the D@@ KS . &quot;

Clin@@ ics earn 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % of the federal government &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Hillary Clinton published its tax declar@@ ations for the Democrats and its husband an income of USD 10,@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , Clinton &apos;s USD 1 million donated for charity , mainly to Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton generated sales of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for her book on Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine , Virginia , publishes his tax declar@@ ations of the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hillary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine continue to continue standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ &apos;s Figh@@ ters campaign in Jennifer Pal@@ mo@@ i , known in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a cr@@ isp@@ y contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind wrong out@@ ings and tra@@ ders to publish his tax declar@@ ations regarding his previous promises . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidate to publish its tax declar@@ ations , although they are not obliged by law because of this . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have given a tax examination by tax authorities as a reason for ref@@ using . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ &apos;s Choice Award in Ian &apos;s on Twitter , referring to the publication of the Presi@@ dential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael Co@@ hen , Tr@@ um@@ ps Special Advisor , said to CNN that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before the tax tests are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ um@@ ps critics , among others the Republican Presi@@ dential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already abandoned that his ref@@ us@@ al issues relating to assets , its donations for charity organisations , its business and various other compounds , in particular with Russia . &quot;
Clinton had already over@@ thrown on the issue and published a video on the Internet on Friday in which the senior rep@@ ublic@@ ans rep@@ ublic@@ ans release his tax returns .
on Thursday they spoke the subject even during a speech about the economy in Michigan .
&quot; he ref@@ uses to do what each other presidential candidate has done in recent decades and release his tax declar@@ ations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; POL@@ IT@@ ICO reported that Tr@@ ump has not paid for two years or only very little Tax@@ es during the 1990s and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax schemes and tax advis@@ ers , which could still be the case . &quot;
federal government has become a theme in election campaign .
&quot; Clinton supports a regulation which is named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that persons of more than USD 1 million deserve a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during a campaign for Hillary Clinton in Omaha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial glomer@@ ate set up his seat here , Tr@@ ump at a meeting to meet their tax declar@@ ations . &quot;
buff@@ ets said he was also subjected to a tax test of the IRS as well as Tr@@ ump did &quot; fear &quot; in front of the elec@@ tors and not before tax authorities .
Clin@@ ics campaign has published tax declar@@ ations by the year 2007 .
&quot; Clin@@ ics , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approximately 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approximately 40@@ ,5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax returns of the Clin@@ ics in 2015 showed that only USD 100 of their income has been included , unlike most of the Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main funds was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ics divi@@ den@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9,000 . &quot;

con@@ doms con@@ doms of Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der - Promot@@ e fire cra@@ fting A@@ anias by Tanz@@ anias Ele@@ gant
&quot; Prot@@ ector in Tanzania do an un@@ orthodox type to keep eleph@@ ants from it , living in people inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them , which are filled with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had already intensi@@ fied the idea of years ago by promoting volunteers in the north of Tanzania by organising a violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and harvest@@ ing without being vulnerable animals . &quot;
many Spe@@ akers have used to defend itself .
Friday is the telephone day dedicated to animal protection .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we could observe a change in this church , whereby it is much more obvious that they are able to hurt the eleph@@ ants of their fields without the eleph@@ ants &quot; , &quot; expressed himself the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps cover the lighting of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and the bub@@ bles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der is mixed with earth , together with a fire@@ work village into a con@@ dom , whose end is added to the ignition only . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom burst into the air with a pop @-@ up and spray the dust in the air . &quot;
a hint is quite right in the rule to hunt eleph@@ ants .
&quot; one last possibility represents an advertising , which rot@@ ates a golf work in the air and caused a loud , bright explosion . &quot;

&quot; however , at the request of the construction of a sales center on the Rhine river in the immediate vicinity of the Rh@@ en@@ ish Rhein@@ bal@@ k@@ ons , however , the city council refused to go one acc@@ ord . &quot;

Jewish director sm@@ ites Berlin hotel because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; extra@@ ordin@@ ation - RT News
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots unle@@ ashed a media suspension after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix , because it would have requested Arab guests according to a staff . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ a &quot; brought his anger at the Kemp@@ inski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by wrote an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel in the country &apos;s country chec@@ kl@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among countries that can be called directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel has eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol offers a possibility to use Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director went to the hotel &apos;s concept . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; he sho@@ cked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel noted that the measure was a &quot; intenti@@ onal decision of management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel .
&quot; the reason that stood behind , caused more anger in the director . &quot;
&quot; the majority of our guests are Arabs and they demanded that the di@@ alling code will be deleted , the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man named this a &quot; big shame , &quot; says the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and troubled by this event .
that is really sh@@ ame@@ ful .
&quot; the fact that this has been added to Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even a bigger dis@@ grace . &quot;
no explanation of this needs .
&quot; we expect the hotel &quot; &quot; the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident yiel@@ ded a pretty big response in the internet , where people named it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some under@@ stated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it had been given the alleged sum@@ mon@@ tory of Arabic guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; &quot; said it in another post in which it was noted that the hotel located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly gave all the accus@@ ations of itself and called the incident &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never been a direct statement , &quot; Israel won &apos;t take on the quick@@ est list , &quot; quoted the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it adds that the country code has now been added . &quot;
police re@@ acts lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber lin@@ king against protest@@ ers Brazilian students
students come together on Thursday in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo to protest together in the Brazilian town of Sao Paulo when they were gathered to demonstrate the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police set lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and rubber bul@@ lets against demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to cast out the students apart from what led to the police g@@ ums and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Federal Council of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300,000 students will be converted to save money . &quot;
some of the participants see Gra@@ ff@@ it@@ its against the provisional pre@@ sidents of Michel Tem@@ an in walls .
&quot; the recent protests occurred certain days after protest@@ ers went to the streets to support the sus@@ pen@@ ed President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been ab@@ stain@@ ed by a vote in the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; according to Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan , the balance between Moscow and Teheran grew by 7@@ 0.9 percent in the year comparison , according to Russian ambassador in Iran . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest grew strongly in the country of Russian companies in stores in the country , divided the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies offer existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to get access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further trading structure is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that the balance between Russia and Iran in the first five months of 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 , and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent , and tot@@ alled $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade turn was reached by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ h@@ ag@@ ar@@ yan enters Russia this year from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign represent@@ ations issued around 35,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travelling by the Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the Top 20 of the countries representing the tourist number in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record pay ir@@ ish tourists in Russia from the last year will be broken , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something , from which the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; personally , I can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who received the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses are looking for : beverage market in forest fires
a rob@@ ber@@ y on Thursday evening was pract@@ ised on the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the am@@ bush weapon of a Sch@@ uss@@ w@@ affe required three dark sha@@ ved persons who ruled their faces , from the employee of the beverage market , the release of cash and escaped first at the beginning and then presumably with a silver @-@ coloured VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money is being exploited , the police will not divide . &quot;
&quot; the perpet@@ rators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters tall , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpet@@ rators must be sc@@ anned after the assault in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and fled from opposite the parking garage with the silver @-@ coloured car , possibly in direction B 256 ( sleeping ring ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking observations on the crime time ( at 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) , those who are in connection with the pre@@ dat@@ ory attack is strongly noti@@ fied in the police . &quot;
nail : play and fun at summer @-@ free time
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the soci@@ alizing daily group / social group work of the child protection rating Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers on their summer @-@ free time in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Mü@@ hl@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet open @-@ hand , Hard@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle was the vital group during the first week of school week . &quot;
several full @-@ day trips were on the program .
for one went to Britt@@ a with the visit of the Sp@@ her@@ z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other , Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special Kinder@@ duction in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group spent on the deep lake in Maul@@ bron@@ n , who invited for jumping , swimming and planning . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pil@@ ates to the gate of mercy
the immigrants from the past@@ oral unit Ey@@ acht@@ al @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road to a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages have been taken together .
&quot; in order to cross the period until the next Rom@@ s@@ lick of all ministers in two years , the minist@@ erial round of St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage targets have been reviewed and one decided to finally decided to attend the B@@ ish@@ ops of Freiburg , where he opened a special pilgrimage to the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy in Freiburg on the occasion of the Holy Year &apos;s Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and holy rooms are on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening , the pilgrims sent the pilgrims in a little celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage and distributed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the Vill@@ ingen , where also a Mu@@ enster age is standing and so the pilgrimage to Münster was joined . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were surrounded in the morning and in the evening , depending on a brief stimul@@ us with various prayers , songs and fon@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , Min@@ is went to field cru@@ ises , chap@@ els or churches , together again , together to sing a song from specifically together pilgri@@ m love . &quot;
&quot; for overnight stays , the local parish of the local parish were available . &quot;
at the Et@@ app@@ enz@@ iel@@ en Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a tasty as well as stronger dinner and breakfast .
on the second day Fur@@ tw@@ angen went to G@@ üt@@ enbach on the second day .
&quot; tags in the course of St. Peter , on which the most exhau@@ sting route was , however , had to cut down around 500 metres of altitude in the heat of the heat and thereafter again . &quot;
the served reward was a common gr@@ illing at the bath in the evening .
after the morning impulse on the fourth Pil@@ gri@@ mage in the imposing Con@@ vent church of St. Peter went on the closing case to Freiburg .
&quot; clearly reli@@ eved and happy , Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Frei@@ burger Mu@@ enster in the late afternoon and moved to the gates of mercy . &quot;
&quot; with a small impulse , it was thanks to God . &quot;
the Min@@ is was welcomed by Ko@@ i Markus O@@ bert in the evening mass in Münster .
after the divine service the pilgrims were visiting the vest@@ ry and the high altar .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ cia metropolis .
in the afternoon there was by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants were agreed that the days of spiritu@@ ality and a strong community experience were min@@ ted . &quot;
Sch@@ otte Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner stor@@ med at home when Br@@ ite sk@@ ates gold for cycling .
&quot; Scotland Call@@ um S@@ kin@@ ner ra@@ ged last night in the Män@@ ner@@ rom in Rio for fame , as the British team defended the title of London 2012 . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the role of his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y , who had made his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . he made the legend , when he stor@@ med to home a victory of the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
&quot; England claimed four years ago a sho@@ cking victory , while Ho@@ y repeated the fifth of six Olympics medals . &quot;
&quot; they repeated the trick , after they came in March at the railway world cup in London despite the return of Ho@@ ys just a humble sixth place . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as hin@@ der .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ re produced a gap that tried to close K@@ ian Em@@ adi and Matt Cr@@ ampton .
&quot; S@@ kin@@ ner was the man in whom they stayed , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - who won four years ago with Ho@@ y Win@@ ner - and S@@ kin@@ ner sat in the qualification round a Olympics , but the New Zealand won the New Ze@@ al@@ ander in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap left behind , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and S@@ kin@@ ner stopped it . &quot;
&quot; a strategy change made a great part of transformation , in which it drove in a higher gear to slow it and it &apos;s Kenn@@ y and especially S@@ kin@@ ner to enable the temp@@ o . &quot;
Ho@@ y looked at his position as a BBC expert and fell s@@ kin@@ ner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des , appearing on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old S@@ kin@@ ner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am just here to do my best and to make me a name .
we mounted a Olympics in the final round and defe@@ ats the World Champion .
it was just amazing .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; following the triumph in 2012 on the site Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des gave it to the railway after a weak start . &quot;
he retired this statement later and there was no appeal of England &apos;s rival .
&quot; in such an outstanding victory , this time there was no problem . &quot;
&quot; hin@@ der said , &quot; It feels like the full GB flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we came together in the last three months as a team .
&quot; so many world titles have come so po@@ or@@ ly , that it was unbelievable to win again at the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , the seven out of 10 tracks both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if you have a per@@ tin@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in Vel@@ o@@ drome .
&quot; with the shape of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be born for Kenn@@ y - exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( a apparently holy date for the British sport ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that comes from Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is part of the Sprint race which begins today and will go over three days .
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team @-@ event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something lon@@ ely to win alone .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two gold medals , he should become a k@@ night . &quot;
it was the only medal competition of the day but there were more good news for England .
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Cl@@ ancy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four @-@ kilometre race . &quot;
they came in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , at the Wig@@ gins with safety in focus . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he was cont@@ ested to the qualification round before the qualification , called his officials to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the respective women &apos;s competition , continued and termin@@ ated , av@@ anc@@ ated Laura Des@@ p@@ ite , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell Sh@@ and , E@@ lin@@ or Barker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald at world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team reli@@ es on its strong line @-@ wheel team to domin@@ ate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a ch@@ ar to medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary depic@@ tion of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations were driven for Rio . &quot;
&quot; back in April , Dr@@ amas played in the background , as the resignation of the technical leader Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton in April , in the midst of sex@@ is@@ mus@@ sels and mo@@ b@@ b@@ ing@@ asts , as well as retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria P@@ end@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , when you look at the first night of the competition in the Vel@@ o@@ drome , it looks like the legendary GB@@ S , which has reached the perfect moment its cli@@ max again . &quot;
the future of melting of Portland due to increase in energy consumption .
&quot; the future of the aluminium mel@@ ts of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs from workers - stand on the game , as the system operator will cancel the energy contract and thus raising all delivery contracts , such as the supplier for energy companies . &quot;
this step was followed by the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year no further subsidies to operate .
a sub@@ sid@@ y for 20 years runs in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Portland stand in the game . &quot;
&quot; not less than 2000 work@@ places , direct and indirect - could be endangered in closing . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it could occur to domin@@ oplast@@ ies as the melting pot consumes around 10 per cent of total electricity generation Vict@@ ori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led last year to an closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea Kraft@@ werk . &quot;
&quot; the melt of Al@@ coa in Portland loses money and ris@@ ked a closing . &quot;
this step follows the years of spec@@ ulation on the future of the plant originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the system .
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium mel@@ on with his Lo@@ y Yang A power plant in Lat@@ in@@ Valley , shared with that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the facility is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , including the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is continued to operate in Portland , which means another physical demand for electricity by the melting means &quot; divided the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to continue , that the contracts called &quot; &quot; securing transactions &quot; , &quot; which would have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; contracts have a 12 @-@ month closing date , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue , &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
&quot; all potential impact on the AG@@ L revenues from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of powerful dates for wholesale electricity prices . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L told that it had already written the value of contracts in his annual turn of $ 187 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of termination &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Al@@ coa said that the decision to make the tre@@ aties have the &quot; Sk@@ ir@@ as ... &quot; to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melting pot .
&quot; the US company said that it had completed a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who should have entered into force in 2010 , even if it is still an explanation , why it has come from the contract . &quot;
analysts are war@@ n due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Portland is about 900 meg@@ awatts and Tom@@ ago consume about 900 meg@@ awatts . &quot;
&quot; if both systems should disappear from the market , it would mean considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator , it would not be good , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all J@@ enner , 20 , Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ J@@ enner Cl@@ ans Kris is the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US Vog@@ ue issue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the ambassador ambassador of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der is and on the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York ran on Thursday the news on its Inst@@ ag@@ ram account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , brought me the sight of this co@@ vers to weeping , &quot; wrote K@@ end@@ all . &quot;
&quot; the unveil@@ ing of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s similar ? ) , sc@@ pt@@ ted reality video that ends the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an On@@ yx and producers of Ke@@ eping Up Ryan Se@@ ac@@ rest ) as well as they have finished the cover of her sister : they all have a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the cl@@ am@@ ee@@ ee@@ ee@@ ete plot of nearly every birthday party with a child &apos;s return ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; You knew that we had forgotten you ? &quot; , with hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a Senate Square at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to participate her other girl somehow on this public@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vog@@ ue issue , a new era of Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ alls big sister Kim likes her what the Vog@@ ue Cover is concerned ( her and her husband Kan@@ ye West were to see in April 2014 ) , but the cover of September issue of the magazine is a league for themselves . &quot;
the September issue is the most famous issue of the year for Vog@@ ue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference , which resem@@ bles a picture tape as a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista , of the 8@@ 32 pages of the roller 6@@ 15 pages ) . &quot;
the unveil@@ ing of his co@@ ar is expected to be ho@@ oked in the past two years ago in the history of the official announ@@ cer .
&quot; women who were already on the cover are Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Moss . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ities , the modelling &quot; than &quot; models , the celebr@@ ities are &quot; in the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ Prize winner and Di@@ or @-@ brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was in 2013 on the cover , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs J@@ enner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; perme@@ ating model &quot; of its generation - under the earlier category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celebr@@ ities are not related to famous individuals , or reality stars or you@@ ths of today who know how to turn a good Snap@@ chat video ( even though it applies to the denomin@@ ator ) . &quot;
they are really talented women who draw themselves in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , which appeared on the last cover , had the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers don &apos;t like success . &quot;
with their reality TV @-@ story J@@ enn@@ ess &apos;s position was always an@@ cho@@ red in the fashion world .
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Stephanie Se@@ ym@@ our J@@ enner and their colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did , called her &quot; the Mist@@ akes of moment . &quot;
these feelings collabor@@ ates up again when the message came out with the Shows J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vog@@ ue Cover .

&quot; municipal centres indicate a year of 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s most common aid centres are rejected annually by the community centres , while the sector accounts for further middle cuts already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland , three of five persons - mostly elderly persons , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ og@@ ations and the like - were rejected by their search for free legal advice and legal counsel . &quot;
&quot; legal services provided by the municipality , which are already excessive , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; starting June next year , however , that these legal centres will lose further 30 percent of its federal agents . &quot;
&quot; the director of the community centres of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rell , said that the last collection of the National Association of Community centres revealed that thousands of people have been rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ rell said that the situation would be even worse by the government &apos;s decision .
&quot; in Queensland , Australia &apos;s joint centres are chron@@ ically under@@ financed , which means thousands of people of important services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ mistak@@ able and supp@@ ressed debts , families who have dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers , which are un@@ just@@ ly dismissed - all these people have problems righ@@ t@@ ful manner and this survey shows that they do not need the help they need . &quot;
&quot; as of June 2017 , the Federal Government will reduce its funds by 30 percent , which means that thousands of helpful people from Queensland will be forced to access their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the Federal Prosecutor and the Federal Minister for the Federal Prosecutor , as well as sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis to withdraw this middle cuts immediately , so people can obtain the help they need to obtain legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the State Government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for legal affairs on the national average . &quot;
&quot; now it is time to view the needs of the community centres and its customers community , as well as the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government invested in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump election campaign was accused of having responded to his staff

Berlin / Schwerin : pol@@ l conducted to the European elections : SPD and CDU
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , substantial losses for the gover@@ ning party SPD and CDU began . &quot;
this revealed representative surveys from opinion research institute in ins@@ a for the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could continue to reg@@ ain in the north , this is not possible after the demand in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would have the strongest party and would have had good chances to continue the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD r@@ ushes from 3@@ 5.6 percent to 24 percent in five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party is only slightly ahead of the CDU , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
third place is fought between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left should come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent for the first time in the country . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hes@@ itation by 6 per cent ( previously 8.7 percent ) once again in the state of the country . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at the country &apos;s day with 3 percent .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ uties , the German Social Democratic Party ( Germany ) reported only to 23 percent ( Ele@@ ction 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CDU was only 18 percent after 21.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; this means that they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 per cent ( 2011 : 17,@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented with 14 percent for the first time in the House of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to a return , the pir@@ ate would fail in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ Mail and Internet in time : 20 years ago Nokia was launched onto the market .
the successor today domin@@ ate the world - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
&quot; the device weighed almost half a kilogram , and was more than four times as hard as an iPhone 5 . &quot;
&quot; it was th@@ icker and bigger , it was therefore not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty tough . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in store was at the beginning of eight meg@@ abytes , which would suff@@ ice with high resolution today . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 GB .
&quot; the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; was exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , into the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros lovers can buy the appliances on the internet , but they come somehow from the stone time of the internet . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , the Communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone producer had announced the product a few months earlier on the computer trade fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ bottle format . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new cell phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and emails were sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible via HTML browser , though qu@@ el@@ ly slowly . &quot;
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the cell could be easily folded as a laptop . &quot;
then there is a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud of the price : 2700 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smart phones in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros .
nobody could conc@@ eive in August 1996 that communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything has been different .
&quot; smart phones are a success story , although not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile phone , the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was finally sold to Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; the market today rule the market , which later came to be a Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always online and everywhere , this is for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple alone , 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , worldwide sales with the equipment lies at around 400 billion euros . &quot;
the well @-@ ongoing business of the countless app provider and telecommunications equipment contribute to this .
&quot; around the smartphone , a whole industry was created . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on mass market was first introduced in early 2007 , at that time , Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones at the time . &quot;
&quot; he spoke three instruments in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communication , everything by touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple began the company &apos;s triumph@@ al march , today the iPhone is the company &apos;s most important product . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motorola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the descendants . &quot;
&quot; they finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the S@@ ages now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after his invention a choice .
&quot; today , each German is looking for 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we must learn to learn the smartphone even times , &quot; said Jan@@ ina &apos;s sphere , responsible for the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent re@@ tention is now valid as a curse and blessing .
England must draw the Olympic spirit and train to Heath@@ row
&quot; Heath@@ row will not only place in our local municipalities and throughout London , but in whole country restoration and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the biggest attraction of Heath@@ row , just as in 2012 in London when we operated a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benef@@ itted from playing . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and this will happen again by creating new opportunities for local and companies near Heath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities we will have 10,000 new teachers , creating 40,000 new jobs and prepare for youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were in London 2012 , it will be giving you that the challenge of the extension of the extension of Heath@@ row is too large . &quot;
&quot; it was told me that England will never be ready for the games , and that we will shave on the world stage . &quot;
the two @-@ fl@@ yers had wrong in 2012 and they will also lie in Heath@@ row .
there are always obstacles to pass away but Heath@@ row answered each question every question .
like the Olympic Games there is Heath@@ row for many and not for single infrastructure project .
&quot; expansion is an opportunity to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in wit@@ ty growth , and to leave a legacy of skills and employment to the airport as well as in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in Heath@@ row , which has converted a £ 11 billion more expensive infrastructure investment program from the T5 - which was chosen for five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T2 , which was built in the middle of the two @-@ frequ@@ ented cat@@ walk . &quot;
now they are ready to provide a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the 2012 London Games were a great success for the UK and I am confident that Heath@@ row &apos;s expansion will also be one .
&quot; it is time for us to expand this Olympic spirit and meet Heath@@ row and create our future trade , and create a legacy of skills and employment , which may be proud of England . &quot;
Lord Paul D@@ eigh@@ ton is the Chairman of the Heath@@ row Boards and former Commercial Secretary to the Treasury
&quot; block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding display block &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to get ad block blocking , a &quot; cat@@ ching and mouse game &quot; are equal to one of the software manufacturers attempts . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announ@@ cing that there would be a block@@ ade on its desktop @-@ page , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ gger , in which it dict@@ ated that users could update their filters in the program to block additional advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that his des@@ kt@@ op@@ side would change the encoding concerning his advertis@@ ements to make it compl@@ aining that part of the page advertising is to be harder to make . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of H@@ in @-@ and @-@ Her struggle between the stimul@@ ating open source community and the conver@@ ters have already been underway , and that Facebook is coming soon with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has settled for social media in the struggle is a strong indi@@ an , how wor@@ r@@ ying ad @-@ loos@@ ening for the industry has become . &quot;
&quot; according to a study conducted by Pa@@ j@@ air and Adobe around 200 million people worldwide , it is almost four times so much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users , access@@ ing Facebook over their mobile devices , hand@@ y@@ wer@@ ve makes 84 percent of advertising revenues . &quot;
&quot; the company has released it on ad @-@ block@@ ers on Desktop PCs , as mobile ad block has no effect on Fac@@ ebooks @-@ mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ ag@@ ram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on Desktop PCs makes a sufficient proportion of revenues , so Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would be &quot; ad @-@ pre@@ ference tool &quot; to have more control over them aimed at targeted advertis@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that ad@@ block would be wor@@ r@@ ying new filters because they would also block content on the site which are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users there is no positive experience , therefore we plan to address the problem , shared a spokes@@ man of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; sco@@ ot@@ ers are a bl@@ unt environment , which is why we have focused on the developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to lay more control in the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was at the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police calls witnesses after a woman in the early hours of the morning , on Thursday after an alleged suicide of several vehicles on a highway . &quot;
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman laid down in the dark &quot; in an act of desp@@ air &quot; on the road and were hit by several cars , the police told V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss franc at the age of 49 was that of several vehicles , including a truck car , was going to kill himself . &quot;
she died on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some are still not identified , the police , which , as well as every witnesses of the incident , were reported to report . &quot;
it was opened an investigation procedure which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation shared by Gilles Hof@@ st@@ etter the Le Tribun@@ e de Gen@@ eve .
&quot; however , it remains to wait if one of the drivers are displayed . &quot;
was a cl@@ ash inevitable ?
&quot; this is something that the prosecutor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ etter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that the drivers are not drawn to the responsibility .
&quot; in each of the two cases - with which one person in the Dark On@@ es ran on the highway - it was decided that the drivers do not go out of it in the middle of the night , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acquitted when she had suffered a man and killed , who had died in August 2014 one night on the A1 in the vicinity of Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk , and has become un@@ conscious of the street . &quot;
&quot; the court determined that the police had responded to a just@@ itu@@ ary -- on a justified species , and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely extraordinary and un@@ predic@@ table situation &quot; &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has more information on the incident occurred near Morges , should be noti@@ fied at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA climate model : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
Venus had probably inhab@@ itable the projec@@ tions of a new NASA climate model probably once .
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorith@@ ms that are similar to those of climate research .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have identified with their hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once er@@ d@@ ently . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow revolution could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , erotic atmosphere and slowly revol@@ ted . &quot;
the model also lighted the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet is thought to be more dry than de Earth , but once had enough water and ge@@ ographic vari@@ ability to host life and protected against rapid ev@@ ap@@ oration . &quot;
&quot; early Venus benef@@ ited from a sun , which was 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation , the slow revolution of Venus exp@@ on@@ ded its daylight side of the Sun for almost two months , &quot; G@@ ISS scientist Anthony del Gen@@ io explained in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produced rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which seems like an umbrella due to the surface of a large solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result are average temperatures , which are some degrees cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
&quot; the model brought a story of Venus , resem@@ bles that of evolution , which previously suspected of planetary resear@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; although it was likely to be inhab@@ itable , Venus was exposed to high heat and ultra@@ violet light during the course of several years . &quot;
its oceans ev@@ ap@@ or@@ ate and her water vap@@ or was burned down from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as her Hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a fatal greenhouse effect - Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers distributed the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Letters .
Patrick Roy emerg@@ es as a coach of Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a minor determination to the decision of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and notice that the association will immediately look for a new coach .
&quot; over the past three years , I have met my duties as Music Coach and vice president of Hockey Operations of Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and identification , &quot; &quot; the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy expressed in a opinion . &quot;
&quot; during the summer of summer and much more about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , it is needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of Train@@ ers and Vice President Of Hockey Operations must be perfectly matched to the organization . &quot;
it must also have a determination of just@@ ification at decisions which influence the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not fulfilled .
&quot; Sak@@ ic who appointed Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 during his debut season , Jack Adams Awards was the best coach of the League . &quot;
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of Pl@@ a@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the late season in each of the two last years . &quot;
&quot; the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season , and fell by five points behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot in the Western Conference . &quot;

&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ pers can take hold of talks , place strike &quot;
&quot; the labour force regarding the re@@ mun@@ eration for North Sea workers are exposed , while all the parties will put on the table for a new discussion on the table , said negoti@@ ator . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been carried out on platforms in North Sea by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and its unions can confirm that we have agreed to re @-@ start the conclu@@ ding process of the current stre@@ ites , &quot; says it in a joint statement . &quot;
we will stop some full @-@ day sessions in the coming weeks that will start next year to re@@ work the problems .
&quot; the unions affir@@ med that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has reduced the rates of its contra@@ ctors in North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rating follows a 10 percent reduction in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the necessary space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has announced for his part of thousands of people and plans to advance his oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries as a result of its business activities as a result of its meg@@ ac@@ tit@@ re , with the UK energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; due to its lower crude oil prices , energy companies are under pressure , an economic situation involving the British in June that had left the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish Parliament committee , Dave Anderson , met at the beginning of this week with workers &quot; leaders in order to discuss one of the largest labour disp@@ utes which took place in the North Sea since one generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need a economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending for new projects in the North Sea are expected to spend an average of around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Kepler measures Rot@@ ary ratings of stars in the star @-@ stages of Ple@@ y@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Kepler &apos;s dream teles@@ cope helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalog of rotation rates among the stars of the star section of the Pl@@ ei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help to understand the astronom@@ ers , why stars are rotating at different rates as well as in which connection the rot@@ ational rooms with the planet development . &quot;
&quot; we hope that we experience through the compar@@ ing of our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , his age and even the story of his Solar System , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at the C@@ alt@@ ech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ stages of the Ple@@ y@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light years away from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this constellation that originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
it now turn the fastest .
top stars star@@ ches great amounts of star@@ ches .
&quot; because these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is al@@ igned , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Kepler measures the rot@@ ational rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a noticeable star@@ ring -- like sun st@@ ains -- .
the most recent catalog of red @-@ rates shows that massive stars are more slower than less massive stars .
Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars of slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ aden we see that slow Rot@@ ors tend to tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the constellation of Ple@@ y@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmetic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the constellation of Ple@@ y@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; &quot; Reb@@ ull said . &quot;
&quot; there is still much ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , When , and why stars will slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
Reb@@ ull and their colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the Ple@@ j@@ ads , which are soon published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball @-@ star emerg@@ es from
the tears were running faster at Alex Rodri@@ guez faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base Base .
&quot; after its emotional return date , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be performing the Tri@@ ko@@ t of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on 12 August . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Good@@ bye &apos; to teach , &quot; stated the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participants in the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected the most valuable player of the League , in 2009 he won the World Series with Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature is under a tenth year contract to him a total of 27 million US dollars annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of contra@@ diction on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ guez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 @-@ 2004 ) , and since 2005 he managed some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of Fame members H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two additional bas@@ eball player found similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
but the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is nevertheless not recorded in the glory hall of the bas@@ eb@@ alls .
because so successful Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - on the field was so controversial will be his appearance outside the place .
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star gave &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; to have banned ster@@ oids between 2001 and 2003 . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was blocked for 211 games due to an agreement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez is considered the main susp@@ ect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in Süd @-@ Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the league could even have done a favor in 2014 , because I played 20 years without a break , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez at the time . &quot;
&quot; his deportation @-@ days did not cease , too . &quot;
&quot; during many bas@@ eball legend in their last games , Rodri@@ guez had to sit on the bench frequently . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include farewell @-@ tour . &quot;
&quot; my job contains the attempt to win any game , &quot; Yan@@ ke@@ es Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;

&quot; cat@@ ching : due to a positive D@@ oping sample , Wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland can not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be overs@@ ha@@ iled by the first official D@@ oping cases .
an experienced athl@@ ete had won almost a medal .
&quot; prior to the seventh competition , the first official D@@ op@@ ing@@ es have become known for the Rio de Janeiro &apos;s Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ Meter obst@@ acle in sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa from Bulgaria and Polish weight @-@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ inski were tested positive and excluded - immediately before the start of the athle@@ tics athle@@ tics competitions , these messages come to the in@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was discovered last Sunday that is used as a m@@ asked agent for dental pieces . &quot;
the International Sport@@ Tribunal CA@@ S confirmed on Friday afternoon at the time of their exclusion from the Olympic Games .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 year old had occupied the fourth place in the final above 100 m butter@@ fly , just around 0.@@ 09 seconds , they missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have to participate in the demonstrations over 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing at the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; very serious and demands from Ch@@ en full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work with the International Sport@@ Tribunal CA@@ S and will accept the judgment . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , no longer is the IOC but the CA@@ S is responsible for the sanctions of sport@@ s@@ men with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also in the night of Rio le@@ ak@@ ened the news about the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; that was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she told the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplement , &quot; explained the athl@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said to act in the banned substance to negoti@@ ate the blood d@@ op@@ ing@@ es EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa was sus@@ pending , according to B@@ NT , the B sample should also be a positive effect . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ sow was promp@@ ted promp@@ tly with criticism of the athl@@ ete &apos;s word .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes won &apos;t go the right battles , &quot; &quot; said : &quot; &quot; we Bulg@@ arians on observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; so , for example , all weight professionals may not participate in Rio in the chronic d@@ oping @-@ loaded nation . &quot;
&quot; in Friday the case of &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ insky , &quot; the London Olympic champion in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z had tested three days before the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both the in@@ gest@@ ures , however , are both allowed to start up to 94 kg in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is another severe blow for the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the IA@@ AF world federation had under@@ lined its launch for systematic D@@ oping down due to systematic D@@ op@@ ings , also the Kenya &apos;s stag@@ nation in Rio also produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the course of swimming @-@ sport , there was also the earlier verses in China for heavy disp@@ utes also among the athletes . &quot;
&quot; thus , the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ to@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympi@@ as@@ ie@@ ger Sun Yang har@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ eth purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium about 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to surrender myself , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in French radio . &quot;
sun rose in the heart of a con@@ frontation with the Australi@@ ans M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for d@@ oping @-@ bet@@ rü@@ ger , &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Sun was positively tested at the Chinese Championships for the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ din , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
data kl@@ au : as per@@ fi@@ de ph@@ oned h@@ ack@@ ers your rans@@ om
programm@@ ers from Er@@ press@@ ors @-@ Malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany last twelve percent of surveyed companies were at least once , partially several victims of a attack with Er@@ press@@ er software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the aim of a ran@@ som@@ ware narr@@ ative . &quot;
40 percent of the victims are willing to benefit from the perpet@@ rators required to use the required systems and data .
the perpet@@ rators speci@@ alize their de@@ press@@ er software according to the observations from Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes to attacks in company network .
&quot; they are successful there , the potentially li@@ kel@@ p rans@@ om is significantly higher than in private use . &quot;
&quot; we currently watch a sc@@ ary fast evolution of pollut@@ ant software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most carriers were still designed to send ads . &quot;
then the perpet@@ rators discovered Er@@ press@@ ation software for itself .
&quot; only private users were the goal , but the change to corporate att@@ acking took place in the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on the computer &apos;s computer , it is looking for continuously changing files like Word@@ - , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files en@@ codes the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; subsequently , the software show@@ cases the demands of the press@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; to get the code key code to the files , the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies bit@@ coin - indicate . &quot;
&quot; but where in private use the personal photo database is on the game , it comes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage fails when a ran@@ som@@ ware suggests . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales loss by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent had to inter@@ rupt the business activity , in case of a case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals were already threatening victims , whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospital c@@ ac@@ utely . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims : pay not , you promote only the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay , get their data again . &quot;
manager is difficult to reject the perpet@@ r@@ ator for managers in view of a stand@@ still .
the h@@ ack@@ ers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , F @-@ Secure researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the narr@@ atives and come to the result : the perpet@@ rators are actually attemp@@ ting to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; you will declare your victims by chat , such as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , free accessible support websites , or de@@ cryp@@ ting free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are saved by a few hundred euros , companies must also act hard to negoti@@ ate and pay five @-@ digit sum@@ s to withdraw their data . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ran@@ som@@ ware Er@@ press@@ um , the h@@ ack@@ ers become increasingly professional and share the work , explains security experts from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a single ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that it is three or four persons . &quot;
the programm@@ ers sell their malware software then in the form of an software structure to the actual er@@ press@@ ors .
&quot; the previous malware kits were created by buying the malware , advice and additional tools for one @-@ time , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery is a custom@@ ization tool that can be changed smaller configur@@ ations , appearance and bran@@ ding , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the Er@@ press@@ ors are then looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the fresh bought software under the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; so , in one of the forums on the ground , the set buys from a crimin@@ als and commissioned the set to install the software on many computers as possible . &quot;
payment is done per in@@ sufficient calcul@@ ator .
&quot; typically , the crimin@@ als then serve with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ nie@@ wski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known for many companies that secure their data better .
over 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey to defend Ran@@ som@@ ware using File Back @-@ ups and Sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpet@@ rators are already following new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful issu@@ ance , the perpet@@ rators are instead using the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski instead . &quot;
&quot; thus , the potential potential for the type of data is even higher than ever before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpet@@ rators could take completely new goals to the internet of things on the grain . &quot;
at the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con demonstrate security researcher how they could have been associated with the Internet associated thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the locking of a der@@ art block heating so many victims would certainly be a rans@@ om . &quot;
&quot; if the perpet@@ rators then be blocking a whole production road instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ sufficient
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to un@@ zip everything : a little SUV , a bit of cou@@ pe and even the vers@@ atility of a min@@ iv@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; sounds quite over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which was constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz has actually proved very flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V seems small , passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the F@@ ond , it works at no place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the inside are well processed and pleasant , only the cockpit @-@ top is falling there . &quot;
versatile as comparable equipment is the HR @-@ V in the storage room .
&quot; it is not only a trunk to 4@@ 53 l ( 4@@ 53 l ) with folded back @-@ down and 10@@ 26 l , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical when it sounds : the sitting area of the back bench can be scre@@ ened , like Kin@@ os@@ essel , and offer the storage space that is high from the ground up to the ceiling is 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , but the loading height with 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
&quot; with 88 kW / 120 hp , the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel engine acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to torque speeds of up to 300 Nm . &quot;
&quot; however , his work should be somewhat qui@@ eter more qui@@ eter . &quot;
the everyday consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is gr@@ ati@@ fying .
there is another motor@@ isation : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
the steering is likely to be more direct .
&quot; in the tested &quot; Executive &quot; top variant , the equipment can be desired . &quot;
&quot; the city @-@ emergency braking system ( working until temp@@ o 32 ) belongs to the safety systems , the coll@@ ision warning system and the track assist@@ ent . &quot;
sometimes the coll@@ ision irrit@@ ates sometimes irrit@@ ated because he rated many obstacles as &quot; her@@ an@@ ar@@ ating objects . &quot;
very reliable works of the remote guide .
and the smart tem@@ po@@ controller respon@@ ds to the traffic sign recognition and dro@@ s@@ sel@@ t to the speed when needed .
&quot; the full connectivity is however only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI jack lie beneath the arm@@ rest and are therefore a little bit complicated .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top @-@ diesel engines are fine . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to invest so much , the petrol engine will receive 20,000 euros , the diesel from 23@@ ,000 Euro . &quot;
the engines meet the Euro @-@ 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and daily car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not responsible : down@@ fall on the passenger bridge
an Air@@ line is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
&quot; liability is conc@@ ei@@ vable only with dangers which are typical of the air traffic , argu@@ ed the regional law of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken out in the fall of a knee .
&quot; the accident , however , could happen everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to pay no damage to the man .
disease : when paying the promot@@ er
&quot; after their journey , only money fell ill after their journey , if the cause of the disease is dou@@ bt@@ ful in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten per cent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the trial , a family was heavily ill in the second day of their tur@@ nal lu@@ bs to diar@@ rhoea and vomiting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
their disease carried out the holi@@ day@@ makers on a faulty plumbing which allegedly contam@@ inated the sea@@ water .
the family was the view that the trip was lacking - and compl@@ ained against the promot@@ er .
&quot; in court , the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
the situation was indeed defective .
but the promot@@ er just learned before the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff .
he had to go out until then that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; so he did not hurt his information , so the judgment . &quot;
especially in the samples of water no imp@@ ur@@ ities were found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by cont@@ ag@@ ion among each other - belonged to the general health risk .
out of 6@@ 91 guests were only 38 dise@@ ased .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , following the refugees of refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people have expressed concern for further attacks . &quot;
the state must be bl@@ amed and decided at the same time .
certainly : our country will not answer the perpet@@ rators of the perpet@@ r@@ ator with hatred and split .
we won &apos;t indul@@ ge this triumph .
&quot; if off@@ ender have to leave the country faster , however , increase safety and strength is also the approval of the population for the refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to implement the proposals for the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ alised rein@@ forcement of security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ digit magn@@ itude over several years . &quot;
a symp@@ tom appearance for terrorism has to be re@@ compens@@ ated again .
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the weapons of weapons will be avoided , especially the purchase of weapons in the internet is exhausted . &quot;
the last widely discussed in@@ justice for doctors should stay tuned after de Mai@@ zi@@ ères .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions how the threat of citizens can be reduced , he said with a view of psych@@ ic ab@@ normal@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister believes a better social support . &quot;
teachers have to be prepared to deal with trau@@ mat@@ ised people .
&quot; for the prosecution of crimin@@ als in special areas of the Internet ( Dar@@ k@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to investigate investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD boss Gabriel , said : &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes further to it . &quot;
it is important that the Interior Minister clearly stated against shareholder .
&quot; that was a ear@@ then for the sni@@ per in the CDU / CS@@ U , &quot; &quot; Gabriel said the papers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected Ru@@ fe from the Union to a Bur@@ ka ban and the abol@@ ition of double citizenship before .
a general ban of perfection is to be constitu@@ tionally problem@@ atic .
&quot; you can not offer everything you refuse , and I rest the carrying out of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; speaking , one can talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses . &quot;
green @-@ Che@@ fin Simone Peter designed the minister to sim@@ ulate it with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act tat@@ too .
left @-@ party leader Bernd Rie@@ x@@ inger said : &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and an disappearance of the residence to bring people in this country no more safety . &quot;
better transport flow on the highway exit
it sto@@ wed regularly on the road route - here &apos;s a picture of November .
but this should change : the de@@ fle@@ ction should be extended .
&quot; this is a good news for all car drivers who stand in the professional traffic on the surrounding road every night in St@@ au , when they drive on the highway ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; road construction works on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , in the area between the Hammer Straße and the Wes@@ er road to the right lane by 700 meters . &quot;
motor@@ ists can then apply directly from the Hammer Straße right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic divi@@ des itself early , thereby improving the procedure on the widely used section of the Federal Road 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit on the CDU faction had the CDU faction in the district of Münster @-@ West .
the road tigh@@ tening on the accessory develops the motor@@ ist especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
week@@ days is enough to travel back to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her path and sometimes also beyond .
reason is the N@@ adel@@ ö@@ hr drive on the B 51 just before the Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic will be suspended only on the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built just over three years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations have revealed that the bridge has no longer necessary to take the necessary load capacity , especially heavy traffic . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck , which is constant in the traffic jam , the competent state can not say . &quot;
&quot; however , the bridge is to be reck@@ oned with years : because the bridge has an official rest@@ rained duration until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal fle@@ ction , the state @-@ operated operation deliberately searched during school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
traffic will be passed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
inter@@ cultural tour : cultural offers for schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule attended the theater play &quot; The un@@ seen House . &quot;
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s and the Young Theater are planning a music project now .
the association Nim@@ a &apos;s has helped young people with mig@@ rant and refugee camps to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; class International &quot; at the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning unit &quot; The un@@ seen house &quot; of Münster &apos;s Theatre .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; &quot; Association of Nim@@ a &apos;s initiated by 19 students between eleven and 15 years , the st@@ aging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which has set itself the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to attend schools with welcome students , as part of this project cultural institutions in Münster . &quot;
&quot; most young people of the class were come from September 2015 to March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , and little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographi@@ es , the scenic images and video animations it would have been possible to follow , however , to act as the press release of the young@@ ling Münster . &quot;
&quot; Nim@@ a &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg , and the Young Theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , juven@@ iles and migration background are supposed to have the chance to get professional , professional courses in the areas of singing , dance , spectac@@ le and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the theatre play and the@@ atri@@ cal language transmission are planned .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the rising refugee numbers , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope in weather repair
the weather has made the shooting stars in the southwest of Germany on the night to Friday a d@@ ash by the bill - but there are still hope .
&quot; the night has been especially suitable for clouds and rain , the president of the Ob@@ servatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we &apos;ll see many shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Persian , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest shooting stars belong to the stars . &quot;
&quot; their names they have , because they apparently come from the constellation Per@@ se@@ us , which goes to the northeast . &quot;
relaxing night : tips against sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you &apos;ll be etern@@ ally awake , at night you wake up hours , in the morning there is no longer pon@@ der to sleep . &quot;
this is all other than relaxing .
&quot; after all , one of these issues is in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than 10 per cent emp@@ ires their sleep often or permanently re@@ covering . &quot;
how can sleep problems or sleep disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep problems , and there are differences of different causes , emphas@@ izes Hans @-@ Günter We@@ e@@ ß , board member of the German Society for sleeping and sleep medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands country among them , but the in@@ som@@ ites is never , i.e. an in- and sle@@ ek . &quot;
&quot; just trying to sleep through many people as uns@@ at@@ is@@ factory or in@@ adequate , Jens Wag@@ enk@@ ne@@ cht , the board member of the German Home Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleeping disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors behind it can be used , but also medicines . &quot;
the sleep disturb@@ ance expression of another disease is not rare .
&quot; very early awakening , especially in depression is frequent , &quot; says We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
and it can be that various factors go to one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can be poor , w@@ aking up every two to three hours and starts bl@@ ur@@ red , through everyday problems and worry , there is a example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you sleep with sleep disorders ?
&quot; if you don &apos;t sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week , and the day should be imp@@ aired , advis@@ ing the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look completely different : it is cut down , tired , in@@ e@@ worthy , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood changes or physical disorders such as stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to relie@@ ve the sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; as treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cogn@@ itive behavi@@ oral therapy or even medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional case and no more for two weeks - in@@ quire . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Professor In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of Inter@@ disciplinary Sle@@ Medical Center of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin , is hardly emphas@@ ized in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore you should first contact sleeping problems at home , advis@@ ing We@@ e@@ ß . &quot;
the problem may clarify whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should come into the sleep laboratory , and what happened ? &quot;
&quot; for the investigation in the sleep laboratory , medical advice , for example with snor@@ ing with respiratory failure , in case of disease @-@ fatigue or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you do not need to prepare for the investigation .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a lunch break , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after driving , one goes into bed at its normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electro@@ des in the body one can carry on the nose g@@ og@@ gles , chest strap and an ant@@ enn@@ as at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep . &quot;
how can I get the problems in the handle ?
&quot; there are rather many actu@@ ators , in which one can place for better sleep . &quot;
&quot; We@@ e@@ ß is counting on : regular bedrooms and rise times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , not watch TV to sleep , alcohol do not take up at the watch - then you start to count immediately , and that is quite and not convey@@ ed at all . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus D@@ ei@@ bler has expressed his dis@@ appo@@ inting cutting of DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is via Facebook .
&quot; in December 2014 , he was first brought gold and presented his first world record at the same time . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus D@@ ei@@ bler via Facebook cont@@ ested his ex @-@ team mate via Facebook . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion gets 20,000 € rewards and a Dsch@@ ung@@ kö@@ nig 150.000 € should not be surprised by lack of medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote in the night to Friday on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ing system in the swimming pool is bad , the d@@ oping control , however , very good . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that do so much and run it in D@@ oping , or even run it . &quot;
&quot; I do not say that the controls should be adjusted , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
he wanted to launch a com@@ eback already for nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) .
that &apos;s exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to control a certain time before the F@@ OS / OS from the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A , you must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who now runs a ice cream . &quot;
airport : gang of Bag@@ di@@ ets arrested

civil war of Düssel@@ dor@@ fer police arrested the capture of two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years .
the susp@@ ects had committed a gang of ker@@ chie@@ fs and luggage steels .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 o &apos;clock , civil servants recognized a gang from the airport in Düsseldorf , known as police officers from last theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several Del@@ ic@@ te since mid @-@ July of this year , and have been collabor@@ ative and worked highly professional . &quot;
&quot; the Speci@@ alists of the crime Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can reject the th@@ ie@@ ves , specifically to commit alleged off@@ ences to Germany , according to four actions . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they were exploited over 15,000 Euros . &quot;

&quot; article about this &quot; trendy neighborhood , &quot; such as the competent estate company Friedrich@@ sha@@ in calls , however , will be preferred by burning cars in the last weeks . &quot;
&quot; reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents were rent ten@@ sions , but on the ground floor , however , rooms are still occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year Berlin , particularly of the Berlin &apos;s inner @-@ scale prev@@ enter , it was extremely difficult for the police against the project as &quot; no @-@ go @-@ zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ ie@@ de , with 300 police officers were pat@@ ated , pat@@ rol the police three weeks ago , sper@@ sed parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
meanwhile renovated building workers in order of unknown house@@ owner the rooms .
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the spati@@ ality had been illegal , and a day later , police and construction workers moved by sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peace@@ fully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about a late late night . &quot;
&quot; in close proximity of the hood , a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens are located . &quot;
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many people : K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who dev@@ out here three children , mainly from the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the hood , they share care of increasing domestic and cent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound like a pine that sum@@ s up mainly pol@@ ishing protection against the left @-@ andal@@ ous left .
&quot; the Gr@@ aben , the Berlin &apos;s Internal Market and the Police between Haus@@ etz@@ als and their neighbours , apparently does not exist . &quot;
Friedrich@@ sha@@ in in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class that has also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk .
&quot; also houses of home projects and the new@@ born residential projects have already been in a lot for a long time : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR , including nearly all the whole main@@ frame near the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared under large police station , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Rig@@ a@@ er and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in the last years has become increasingly becoming the mag@@ nets for tourists and election lin@@ ers from all over the world : with them , people from GDR times and former home @-@ insur@@ ers share their ja@@ w . &quot;
this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents that has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 .
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them in designed slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with d@@ ye .
no other road was mentioned this year together with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; a reason for that not all neighbours can be considered a problem , that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes such as body infr@@ in@@ gement , according to statistics , almost exclusively against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the most important part of the off@@ ences make non@@ fiction , which ten@@ ds to meet the new@@ buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who resi@@ des for 17 years in a rental house beside the controversial 94 , cannot be a matter of un@@ certainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is important : the people in the 94 are their neighbours , which have not been determined . &quot;
there is also the famous burning cars directly in the Rig@@ a@@ er no longer .
&quot; for the studying architect , her road is not a criminal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps each other , lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately moved to the Rig@@ a@@ er street - and stayed .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the people had returned their streets : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
but in the eyes of residents like Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road will continue to take away : by sigh@@ ted new buildings in former construction l@@ g@@ aps that op@@ press old residents .
&quot; these are ultimately the property flats , which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well @-@ called , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not gu@@ thei@@ rs . &quot;
but what to do if one never stops any anybody ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , also with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for breeding , which were annoying about colour bombs , K@@ erst@@ in Neu@@ geb@@ auer gave little understanding : the skin projects and the left side belonged to the Kie@@ z . &quot;
&quot; who moves , should be aware of his - just as someone , who moves in a pub area , can be compl@@ ain about noise there . &quot;
&quot; all only with pre @-@ names presented persons have therefore asked to be called , not to be named with their right name &quot;
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee commissioned
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner in the integration and organis@@ er .
&quot; besides , she is a social worker ahead . &quot;
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the refugee commissioned for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
social ped@@ agog@@ ues supports the team of the management to Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine client of the working group indicates that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now , the jeal@@ ous wool mil@@ dew that has a problem . &quot;
&quot; so , some - less mo@@ cked as much rather on the multitude of desire and goal - meant that the management wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative party with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , just a jeal@@ ous wool of wool . &quot;
&quot; the administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is around organisation , work with people ahead of spot and behind the scenes as well as grid positions . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been involved with around six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent place on three years .
&quot; it was the highest time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine client , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Hon@@ or and full official players supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organis@@ ational , human and comprehen@@ sion problems . &quot;
new containers are soon available in the Was@@ enstraße
&quot; since some time , there is a serious problem , it has been recognized for the connection of the terminal blocks . &quot;
the municipalities are responsible for the connection of the connection .
you need to accommodate refugees in own or rented rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of this accommodation have to wear the community itself . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the land rat@@ es@@ hips to the local community and the job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every land@@ lord wants to offer its apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time .
de facto does not find private apartments .
&quot; so far , it is not working so you should rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments need to be eff@@ ected , as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be set up in the Was@@ enstraße . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , are reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ship sites , training places , training courses , one @-@ euro jobs and practical activities for refugees and migrants who have gre@@ ased or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building or help home@@ work , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very properly , such as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
she hopes the work is to be a positive effect on the community .
that is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
he does not only mean work .
&quot; the day need a fixed structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and Customer . &quot;
the people would have to develop a cav@@ ity .
&quot; so , it offers offers as sports , contacts with loc@@ als and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you can jump on board and volunteers .
&quot; it is central , that the refugees get the feeling of being in Germany , and welcome . &quot;
the long term of procedure is a problem .
&quot; you must explain the refugees that it will take time , and it takes the time to over@@ cross it , for example , language courses . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has the feeling of development , he could not work in Ur@@ bach , could not work , and be un@@ profitable , who will never be able to integrate . &quot;
the distinct majority was motivated .
&quot; but there is also no problem , the customer says hon@@ estly , &quot; people in which nothing goes wrong . &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer may always be motiv@@ ating others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : do the two following the recent events are afraid of radic@@ alization , even in a small municipality like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; what man@@ holes may call &quot; what man@@ holes can call &quot; but does not exclu@@ de it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensitive .
these incid@@ ents are also subject to the refugees .
they were afraid that the attacks were able to bring them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so the main and volunteers must be held on site and in the region after activities .
&quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that a new thrust of refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question , the policy is dis@@ appo@@ inting . &quot;
actually it is un@@ fair to place them hel@@ pers on the spot .
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived yet where we want to hin@@ der , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would relax . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ b@@ acher had already been felt thereby , to integrate the previous people sensible . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 persons , mostly young males . &quot;
&quot; however , if people are in need , they must help them , both women are embar@@ r@@ assed . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , since there is no easy answers . &quot;
