<seg id="1">Compared to Clinics and Trumps economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and prevent the TTP trade agreement - that's both Clinton and trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two U.S. presidential applicants, however, are on the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">The differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental and more philosophical difference.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the, about the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep the doubts rather small and warns against that the state of the economy can hurt - with taxes and control.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton and Clinton regulate the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in contrast, he himself would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will return Regulations massively, and he will be strong for a far reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in contrast, Clinton said: the state has certain tasks to open, he has disadvantaged opportunities and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore the tax would be increased to the rich, says it."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">Trump and Clinton will say almost the same.</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic applicants is also announcing the biggest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State-state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policy and are rejected by the state-critical teemy-wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">"at Trump, there might still be partisan discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policies are obvious.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and return to the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in so far protected areas, oil production should also be possible to terminate the Paris climate agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton aims to extend the renewable energies with their investment program:" a country will create the clean energies and create millions of jobs. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will probably be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in infrastructure - even at international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transports trade agreement, would not sign them."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both the United States do not want to protect the US's international trade, but just protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">They should then be paid better then by Clinton.</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger-wage.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once again he says: the minimum wage must be up, then he says, he should not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the great discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on one side stands Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants to ask at least of the rich, will pay that they pay more taxes and their critics say: more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="12">The scene works normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the division of Condrobs area, a carrier for social help in Bavaria, and among others focused on women on the flight."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are winged.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich north in one of the few decentralized properties for allotted women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs made the establishment together with Pro Familia and the Munich's help.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard before the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has made on their escape experiences with sexual violence," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because they are politically persecuted because they are threatening torture or death or because their families are sending it to Europe," she tells them. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"for women, other reasons were silent for the flight:" many steal away secretly, because they don't see any other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their home, they have experienced experience with sexual violence, forced violence, mormorden, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the move, this continues."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, that tugboat calls for a bottle of water a sexual action is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="31">"even here, single women in refugee shelters often consider than minderless than inferior and abused."</seg>
<seg id="32">"it is estimated that around 90 percent of women who live in the South of the Munich region are traumatised, estimates."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not voluntarily formed."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so pleasant that they say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about enlightening, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often do not find themselves, they need more accommodations for them, call Bahr."</seg>

<seg id="40">"even in Schwaben alone, women are not separated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press announcher of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Oberbayern, Untert- and Central Franconia there are houses in some common areas, or private houses only for single-standing women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodations for women there."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" committee in the European Parliament calls for women to be separately accommodated by men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study which was published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women can be accommodated separately. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of Foreign Affairs"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to announce the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight months war in the words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin took his Turkish opponent in the gold-plated hall of St. Petersburg Palace in reception, I can't hinder the impression that Ankara wants to most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a blow, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smiles were narrored, and he barely had warmth, even for its restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on the other hand, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report of five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count anymore.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even better to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper claimed that Erdogan was so benevolent, would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">"with me, his enthusiasm seemed to be the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable choral showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the signing of a Russian fighter aircraft on the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow reaction to the time was wander.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin explained and accused Ankara to fall into his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the decay was even greater, since it was committed by a friend's boyfriend."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the Vetrw will rebuild up again, if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media led a hefty, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"once upon a time, the Turks would bear record for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the serious leaders of leading officials, that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the territory of Syria, which are controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He fought this vehement.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting only took place because Putin was given to apologise the apologation that he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan is needed in first line all of the friends he can get after the failed coup d "état failed by a failed coup d" état.</seg>
<seg id="28">"repeated terror attacks on Turkey have shaken him, too."</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">Russian sanctions have made Turkey hard - especially the ban of charter flights which usually take several million Russian tourists every year to the Turkish coast.</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has dropped by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel organizers and charter companies will be facilitated if the flights will be absorbed again."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-term onslaught of the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television budget predicted fruits and vegetables, as soon as the Turkish farm imports are allowed."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated this way:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious on the West since its reaction to the attempted power-withdrawal was considered weak response.</seg>
<seg id="38">"to this end, the persisting Groll will come across the EU accession negotiations and Putin - the pike of it is to move from the cool mood and reduce the relationship between Turkey and the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">Russian head of state won a bonus for Ankara in Ankara following the attempted coup d "état support for the elected state organs.</seg>
<seg id="40">"for Moscow, this is very beneficial for Moscow, that itself has a profound fear of regiments."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as it once described me an analyst, an alliance of outsides." two countries who devote themselves from the West and feel badly treated. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still big differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently admitted the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey will support other relevant sites."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be indicative that after almost three hours at the first meeting, both presidents affirmed the press conference, that they did not even strive the topic once."</seg>
<seg id="45">The president of Turkey confessed it to answer a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this. "</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no unique consensus about where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and given the potential for a perfect disaster, as NATO member Turkey leashed the Russian fighter jet - it certainly is better that the two heads of state will talk at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="10">He said to Putin: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a state of state in law and controls on the implementation of your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday, that IVANOV asked to leave his post and encouraged Vaino as his successor."</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysteriously.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergey IVANOV was a long time, one of the closest colleagues of Vladimir Putin and works as he works for the Soviet Secret Service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">He was one of the most powerful men in the country.</seg>

<seg id="19">So here is the result of a kind of power battle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows that.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion, that a man who once had been praised as a potential president, would like to lead to Russian environmental policy - managed to manage large skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, which are cited on the site of the Kremlin, IVANOV said" It's true that I asked you at the beginning of 2012 in a conversation with me this very complex post - you could almost say - complying for four years. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it came out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"before, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Bundessional Service (FSB), he was appointed the KGB, IVANOV was appointed by his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin reached power, he called IVANOV as one of five people, to whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once again, IVANOV had to become president of Russia after Putin's second term in charge of Putin, as a third term of Putin would oppose the constitution."</seg>

<seg id="2">The SPD and Greens said: investors ought to be much stronger in the future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How does one respond to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD proposes a "concept housing" for the next meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">"first of all, it is about the question: who should actually build the favourable apartments?"</seg>
<seg id="7">One regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"SPD-Group president Christoph Bratmann writes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build urban areas, 20 percent of all apartments have to exhibit in social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the affordable housing can also arise in inventory."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the large part of the city hall was, however, as Bratmann:" how are people going to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want to meet investors on such areas at least 10 per cent, but as they have as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new residential construction programme that will cost millions and is to be financed and is to be paid for incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, as Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the fractions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The Left intends to maintain hardships for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of what, as the Bratmann, baht was a tightening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept is implemented, the concept is implemented for additional tasks in the construction administration."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will receive the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">But the programme does not yet say entirely: because the approximately 1260 new apartments should be built anyway.</seg>
<seg id="21">But how do you compare the loss of other about 1300 favourable apartments whose support will be out in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, it will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, the spokesperson of planning Nicole Palm, should now be bought from the city's ongoing ties."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought to get apartments back to the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"upon one stroke, solve this problem."</seg>
<seg id="27">Because in the Weststadt go out at the end of the year.</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could go back to the prices for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">Only: we do not want the owners to do housing companies.</seg>
<seg id="30">"as a result, the number of social housing in western city is drastically increased, it is removed from the goal of the so-called permeability."</seg>
<seg id="31">A concentration of social awakening in just a few neighbourhoods shall not give it any more.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens predict that there will be even movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"Holger Herlitschke writes:" "for a vast majority, the CDU must be with the boat."</seg>

<seg id="9">"the market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand, which overload the server."</seg>
<seg id="10">"within less days, Pokémon Go more users than Tinder and nearly as many as Twitter."</seg>

<seg id="17">"many public reconnaissance campaigns for health, people want to get" "30 minutes of time" "to get" "from the sofa" "and" "to be active every day" "because many public messages are boring as well as to people who look great."</seg>

<seg id="22">"three pillars of health are covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people close the hunt even new friends.</seg>

<seg id="11">"this is not only against election fraud, but should also protect the municipal government before the wider corruption and financial base culture that goes down," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was arranged by Downing Street as a result of the Tower Hamlets election campaign as in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court decided that the official Mayor of Luton Mayor for Rahman should be corrupt according to a litigation against corrupt and illegal practices of his amber."</seg>

<seg id="2">A British traveller subdued his immune system and diggers a serious test - by rejects some of the dirty and ekarrests locations in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the moderator and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk moved his course on a euro coin, a railing on Piccadilly Circus, a rinse knob and a public phone in Russia to prove the resistance of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before leaving each object, he used a Luminometer to show up and show us what he is going on."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results in daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the rinse knob of a drawbar which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely shockingly, but actually there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright with doctors and medical professionals spoke about the promotion of intestinal bacteria, as well as its own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he rejects, more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright was known to test the resistance of his intestines by moving through the world, as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations up to rinsets of toilets, the task presented his immune system definitely under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he told:" already as a child, I was relatively unworried about what my health concerned and I put all possible things in my mouth, earth, worms and slump water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was just born of his reputation.</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its probeard showed a luminous count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared with this, the luminous number of fresh-washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">But there was a Russian toilet that he refused to refusing after their luminance rate was over 4000 units while fresh-washed hands hold one of less than 60</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bactericount of various places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says," This is the worst thing I smoked in a toilet. "</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing dirt than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will feel nothing here because it is drilled here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products validation."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the Company equips master Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both Lactobacilli and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, juices and new categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumer really something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating about watching and at the same time explains the benefits of Probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We led Brainstormings that ended we told "Let's call you Ian.</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of intestinal health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon, and with the documentary we could provide the consumer more information on an interesting way."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humor!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the film directed, added:" "let me say," "I have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I need to leak them, like the Russian toilet, which is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course there were things, in which it was easier to bring Ian to use them and others, with which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm happy that we recorded some of these dirty treats.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio conducted by 2015, 84 percent of respondents said to have exposed lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said that they contain at least occasionally products which molded lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="5">"due to the hard work of the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community Germany anticipates a mass destruction to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckoned with tens of thousands, medium-term, with some hundred thousand protective seekers from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the leader of Ali Toprak of the "World" from Friday.

<seg id="2">Seltsames Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals receive nothing from the summer campaign fighting - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote on the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the country election will not take place directly at the end of the summer holidays, the European Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for more than ever, it doesn't matter: summer holidays, heat and day-war struggle - which is biting."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, which are to be convinced by the election workers, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most holidaymakers on the road are on the road to Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not locals allowed to vote on the country."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems: in the holidays are helpers that hang posters, flyers, flyers, distributing flyers, distributing flyers and drop out at the end of the votes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until September 4, 2016, the electoral and last day of the day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass through the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if one can tell, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of a SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his position."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clear behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">"exciting is very exciting, as strongly Neuling AfD cuts and what remains at the end of the coalition."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister, an almost unobtrusive election campaign makes one of his major posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the land, roses roses and chat a little with the people, as it already did his legendary question Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sailors have cold feet and give Chancellor Merkel the blame for the blasting of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" We manage that "I speeded up the rise of the spopoists what will cost him out now."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidates, the Interior Minister Lorenz Caffier, has experienced, as it is, when you make the right place in the right place campaign for the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has been invited twice to Chancellor Angela Merkel; Merkel's Bundestag and Merkel lies in the northeast.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg-Westphalia and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, was recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too sorry to listen to anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from the usual balances, Nordost CDU largely waives the usual balances on market places and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, like Kokert, plays only a" subordinated role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the union also noted that, on the country, its base has to crumble that it must be very strict, again a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is just like the left, the SPD, the Greens: in the vast expanse of the country is hardly available."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the Council of the CDU electorate coking on his fellow soldier is also self-larvingly:" you have to go where it is weary, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is on the game, Sellering has now called its SPD to a particularly dedicated election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, S & D Group reached 22 percent of the CDU (25) partners behind the CDU (25) and just below the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD still clearly won with 35.6 percent of the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, small-party with seven percent in the polls, should be able to create the leap into the country."</seg>
<seg id="32">"they make a modern virtue from the holidays, and take advantage of an advantage in the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="33">"online campaign contest," says the President Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">Otherwise green campaigns for searching for local stimulants go by holidaymakers.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gaek, the top candidacy, curvt just with a houseboat through the mecklenburgian lakes and it is also nice."</seg>

<seg id="4">"all of them did pretty well, Elvira Tetzl is told by the Jet-gas station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a team team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site was scheduled to be moved to the south of the half, until the end of October will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"blessed is also the opposite of those responsible for the construction, approximately when it comes to the establishment of Behel's rides."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has ended on Monday to the south, and also the blocking of Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen was lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg has again relaxed and has relaxed the traffic situation within the place."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now go on both sides by Ofterdingen from the B 27.</seg>
<seg id="11">The soothing traffic through the place seems to be receded.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable discomfort," says the Chief Executive Management of the office responsible for the restructuring management of Florian King. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bach-Road, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiheron had to fight with more traffic noise because many bleaches were looking for and rather their Navi as the signage."</seg>

<seg id="25">"even at the Autohaus Maier, Thomas Sulz speaks of a" most slight decrease, "but also dreamed of course."</seg>

<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>

<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half of them would have been released, the policy would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Government President Jörg Schmidt on request by Göhner, whether it could give a financial compensation, otherwise it would not have to benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now they also need the disadvantages that arise through the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Göhner knows from other counties, where such a little more generous."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all complaints, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue."</seg>
<seg id="39">"finally, the family business has been located here since 1715, refers to the long history of history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"because of the complicated public transport, other regulars now are less frequently subject to understanding, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't go, it is also very different."</seg>

<seg id="10">But as the Minister of the Interior he was located on results and in a "recoverable consensus" within the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="11">"following the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière was a little time to date, before he presents his conclusions for the safety in the republic."</seg>

<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, told, that a new security authority should take care of the crack-encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">This is also not the fact that Germany has to implement multiple EU directives on air passenger data and arms law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and staff for security agencies is also not surprising.</seg>

<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he still keep doing this for reasonable and demanding nothing at the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas will be presented by Maizière.</seg>
<seg id="20">They are partly in itself: he plans fast-term deportation and more possibilities for detention of people in the expulsion of deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are fetched targeted in the country should check their smartphones and check social media accounts for security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"at Dulce for cancelled asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse still worse than to date - such that offences pardon, or their papers consciously throw away to compensate their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them is political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Manches also works unbalanced and leaves questions open.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - at the inequality of thought, for example, the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, it cannot be expressed in speech that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people faced with the high refugee concerns about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things which people deeply employed people, let not cut off in election campaign times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner safety is enormous in the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The insecurity is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are election competitions."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Union and SPD are therefore increasingly becoming increasingly in position on the topic of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in recent days, it was high between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a gardente dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some unions-interior ministers, also called a Burka ban and a return of double citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also tired here to reconcile tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">From a return from the double compass he hold nothing.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">"you re-establish, do not make sense."</seg>

<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the most discussed recovery of records does not focus on a boom in millennials which we want to welcome the unity of physical objects, but due to mid-life nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all previews at the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most probable buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbyists - it has an emotional meaning: older platforms reserve her feelings rather to themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it time to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, I would follow the camera while in the middle of a bustling road in Soho run, a humble gray suit, before I stand, my hands hold and something to determine how:" so let's throw a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's throw a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of SoHos slowly lies on his charm, hotels, restaurants and offices are now filling the buildings where independent sellers are located - there are still a handful of fantastic landmarks."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera to the next part in which I am up close to various men in such shops and try to estimate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I am from Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle ages) into Reckless Records (data number: eight men of middle ages, one woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I wonder?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess it already says," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these sound panels, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), dress the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he owns a considerable number of albums and singles, is the result of his available income: it is now able to buy records that he could not afford to buy records as they were not able to buy them when he was young and plexed."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy, are out of the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things, where I probably was too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it's true to those who buy records, rather introverted, and likes to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke, and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Wez, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers that he meets with the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he has also noticed a new wave of people who have influenced by the Medieval, people who have heard about the comeback and to buy themselves back their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"of the talks, which I have led, people usually have ended up in 1998 or 1999 by their collection."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of followers of the record revolution of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to recognise that record shops offers a soothing community of equality.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers took the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world, and want to withdraw to the stability of trusted sounddisc envelopes from objects that watch happy Jugenderings."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the colt of a void, or possession of material possessions to be a kind of consolation," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is by me as collectors and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal with spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social worker!" soldered a staff of a platform.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey of ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month, have not yet heard them."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a turntable that they never use, while 7% of those who buy a plate, don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">At this time of news report I would probably look very worried while I blink through a stack to Bossa Nova compilation.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle ages), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone recently joined here and said:" I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a radio head plate, so I'd like to put it into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it is definitely happening."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musicians."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"those are younger people, not old who will go slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted to the sound of the record nearly a whole floor, has an underground audience when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, Teenagers and women's average age."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts: latest synthesia and sextary pop instead of experimental jazz drens from the loudspeakers - is it good to see such diversity in customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very strange, but naissile psychological traumas are hard to be fixed if one stands next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a couple of minutes, and considered the variety of plates which are used for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She is rather a shocking pump than a wholesale store.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so the collection of records are not real option, says it."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs much.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it's easy to listen to music from a computer or to other way, but the beauty of plates is..." she drives with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">"my last stop is a business, which is said that a new generation of record lovers will be inspired by Urban Outfitters."</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I admit that jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young teens who can group for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter consider to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"nobody can see it - perhaps because they are only pure decoratively, some so far above that it is impossible to deal her."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items might mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send to the depths of SoHos for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury objects such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research studies revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors and plate lovers, who exist in reality, record shops and in Onlineages."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard in school or offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not by record shops in Berwick Street and leaves across plates, while they avoid the rigid gaze of an uncanny, 30-year-old presenter that rises above the shoulders of no middle aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected an offer of authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais jungle, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial hearing this week, authorities in Calais assumed that the state should be fugitied to sell 72 of cigarettes to energy drinks, sell hairdresser services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in provising restaurants."</seg>

<seg id="6">They led out that the provisional shops and restaurants often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 Provisional business, but admitted that the concerns of Calais' prefecture are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role as only people who live in extremely preconditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas of tranquil meeting between refugees and volunteers have to offer.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the floor was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, a non-profit organisation and 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum seekers for the hundreds of protection needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>

<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but will probably not be that at least a gold medal for his neck will be hanging around his neck: Fijis manager Ben Ryan, former head of England in Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind them.</seg>
<seg id="9">"eight years ago, they lost to Ryan every game at Adelaide Sevens."</seg>
<seg id="10">They just lost one here.</seg>

<seg id="4">"even if it were only the Beiden sitting at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the Echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was allpresent as they came to the second Olympics in succession, the first women in the history of British sports that were putting on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolute, all her 39.ter unfolded use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant Athlettering, that reflect on the surface with the elegance of swarf, which does not reflect the kind of the triumphes."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in the rowing, a bataillon is to consent to the helpers that make the difference and it was no one more useful than the coach who would not survive this day when it was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do it, he spreads out everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio had good luck that he could be treatment early in early 2014, outside the season, which could begin the interruption to a minimum, if that is the right term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better back soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in the hospital and ran on the station around - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be enough."</seg>
<seg id="18">So it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing is already a challenge, but that makes it even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the informanceability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a winner in the morning to talk more than anything else and tried to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Stanning, who was as captain in the Royal Artillery regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" I was an emotional wreck this week. this is perhaps somewhat extreme, but it means so much. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"it just repeats me how much I mean, how much I and Helen and also Robin worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we wouldn't have a massive thank you. he's the best coach in the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have no race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">"the pair had a hard rhythm, with which their opponents could not keep up."</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to close, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "stay in the process, stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important to get rid of it.</seg>
<seg id="32">"we had a good start and at the same time, we were not looking out to make something great."</seg>
<seg id="33">"we wanted no fireworks today, we wanted to achieve a good result, going out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"bells must appear next week at a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>

<seg id="9">"although there is no direct clues on that government pointed out below Obama, it shows how analysts were exposed to the pressure of their pre-law, a optimistic picture from the threat of Islamic State, also known as ISIS or Isil."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, comments and statements were significantly more positive than the facts presented to the congress."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, CentCom members were publicly announced that a military return of the Mosulate could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>

<seg id="16">"a cultural change, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workaround in London that we have now.</seg>
<seg id="18">We can pluck the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the cake in the first half of the game with a setback out of the closeup.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into the game without victory in the game, but the team showed surprisingly tough and kept the game stand from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">She completed a Sprint with the flat ball on the left flank and then moved into the middle and lupped the ball into the gate to procure the Americans a 2-0 lead.</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the doorkeepers of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the Rio de Janeiro's events will feel consistently and unavoidable, a formidable relay transfer between competition and streches."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is, as the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which will protect his swimmers to the triathletes as a swimmers."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you cannot place the TV, a newspaper read or listen to your neighbours in the queue, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lecovery, or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's swarm of dimples, would certainly have been sent to Prime Time that would have been sent to Prime Time, where he was a swimmers, Turner or even freal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame is not lit every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow, are the sports that are not generally accepted: aerial pistol-shoot, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the chest swimming and may rule over long.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I have modest arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discrete charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoliners have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years it was so sparsely perceived that many people I had questioned did not know that it is a Olympic portal."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA has sent athletes to competition, it has never gained a medal in the trampoline and had a athlete until 2012."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadian women to share for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennon from Canada will defend her gold medal in London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the trampolinjump has a certain outdoor charme, partly because it sounds for the unexplained ear for a clownsSchool as those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a poor enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never-wanted impact, but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that brings it essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means so much means" jumps. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"conquering winner jump on an enormous trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet into the air and have a number of falling movements (turning, real and saltos) before they landing at the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiad, you will be evaluated according to execution, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes of 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists hoped in their quest for gold, faster, up above and above, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, down and down at the bottom of the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they hunt not only the finish line or the output wall, but also a further cavity: that of the world or the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the targeted battle is nobel, admired, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I would need to look at the listener of these games as something.</seg>
<seg id="30">"of this, the trampoline offers an breathing time."</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is top.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or her prune off, seemingly heavy eastronaut as an astronaut goes upward, then downwards, then effortlessly again."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no curbs into the distance, only the dreaming, elegant uplift of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00-Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also around 13.00."</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators, who demand political changes in Ethiopia, struggling for violent opposition of the government."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that they were killed protesters during clashes with the police at Schussers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to go together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally to the west with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests against the government shook the country and spread in more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed on roads and several fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the answer of the government was merciful."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen were shot dead and killed unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security training young people have to strike, while they were forced to make a handheld against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN authority for Human Rights now demands an incoming investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country and future becomes even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa, the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous land of Africa and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence agencies work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror over the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if anything, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Ethiopia's economy expands in considerable pace."</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has drastically improved - there is a new pendal march in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually calm, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"if Ethiopia was anything other as a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, although dissidents were effectively transferred to silence."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile, or sent into prison, or driven into the wilderness."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and have no other options except protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there are numerous complaints, which cover everything from the land use up to the litigation against power of the ruling coalition."</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching election last year, the ruling party and its allies have the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions climb along the border with Eritrea; a battle for this hacky, controversial line called for hundreds of life in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts are afraid that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who were more or less forced on the past few years and could be armed with turbulence."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitration after years of crackelessly explode under the surface now explode.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in the last few years, many Ethiopians were able to communicate via the social media, as cheap smartphones were always more common and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government lock access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do in regular intervals, especially in protests, many people still can communicate via Internet Proxies that hide where they stop."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave that they were so at protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there are more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"since Aeons, the Amharas, who mainly come from Aegean, predominantly Christian highways, in politics and economy, while they are exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are living and in lowlands."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The largest protests were held in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia unfair is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which accounts for about 6 percent of the population and who are dominant in the military, in the intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was up to his death on an unsealed disease in 2012 for 17 years of Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who was thinking about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts predict that he was especially posing in it to perceive early signs of discontent and use special contractor to make opponents and they are unharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"according to the current regime, Mr. Abdi said," "said Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen from relatively unclear reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"Mr. Hailemariam came from the south as Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts predict that he does not enjoy the trust of the Tigray controlled security services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had witnessed such an uproar in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, according to the authors published by the government, apparently by the government and subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following Razicia, many protesters were killed, even if it were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new Pendlerk, as well as for their measurable progress in the poverty line."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this does not prevent the Intensification of the internal misconceptions of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters attacked protesters in Gondar, an official city owned by Tigray and hatred for the Tigray is becoming more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts predict that protests die the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights to the neighboring Somalia, even if they recently been informed that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West is definitely trying to support democracy, he doesn't want to coincide his ally in a volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "Mr. Abdi said," "is a very thin"</seg>

<seg id="3">"this clarification submitted new questions to the communication skills of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he is able to communicate clear and understandable with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings its fellowsoldier, which make an effort to take him during an eventful period of protection, in the actual position we must explain what he could not mean."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the suggestion at a election event held on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump lodged in relation to the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really does not intend to interpret President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">But Mr. Trump said he was simply sarcastic in a morning Tweet on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the contrast, unlike the previous day, on which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation perfectly serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio presenter Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump, saying that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS wanted nothing to do with the Republican Presidential candidate."</seg>

<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July, he attracted strong criticism as he thought that the Russians should bring Mrs. Clinics emails, however he later said" Of course, I said the sarcastic. "</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to shift the language boundaries in politics and then return to rowing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test, such as certain messages of his fans will arrive, as they arrive, and then, if necessary," "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert, who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his testimony vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in various ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of dissharpening the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump hasn't accepted a corrosive sound because his refractures were further decreased."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, who was published on Friday, showed a lead with a big advantage in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump generally tries to excuse itself for his provocative statements, he accused his critics often to contradict his statements or to understand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but as he reinforced the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps sheds have brought his loyal co-dispute into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocant his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent principals, gave himself great effort to defend the candidates in an CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," "Mr Giuliani said to the correctness of Mr. Trumps. Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that Obama was going to ISIS an almost unknown, small organization, he called her backbency, completely wrong and so it happened because he pulled the troops out of Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, it allowed ISIS to spread to spread the situation in the Middle East into control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump made his attacks on the media and designed them to ride in every of his words, and to be biased against him."</seg>

<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historiography.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the last book of" Chop Suey "was written by Chinese cuisine in the United States, while Ziegelman explained in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her newest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at the Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American kitchen during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, carrot snack at Flatiron District, which has already been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"Ziegelman, 54, ordered a cream cheese with Olivenstadchen, while coe, 57, turkey with potato purée and vegetable salad."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when reporters ordered hacky, this found the pair for a discussion on the meal in the era of great depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">There was peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread. "</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and some cheap prepared the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">"imagine, as many peanuts eat that they serve them as dinner."</seg>
<seg id="17">COE smiled flattest.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been laid in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years prior to the Great Depression, the table was in an American household, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women collaborate for male Felites, and it was freshly baked pasted for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans that sent away food during the first World War." "A Square Meal" "is characterized by the ways with which the country went with it, no longer the Schlaraffenland."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food was a central, fishing theme," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was banished: mysterious foods such as breads and Kasserollen have been laid to base agent, the casserole as" wonderful type, food remains reamplified, "then Ziegelman, as quiche unappetizing ingredients were able to hide under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by low-priced dry obst.</seg>
<seg id="25">"flesh, which was the focal point of the American kitchen, was rare in a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"peculiar blends were tried out, as a low calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction was in front of taste or even healthy cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this era, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelmann continues: "it was surreal."</seg>
<seg id="30">Peanut butter and baked onions are not fit to each other.</seg>
<seg id="31">It was typical for many of the housekeeping.</seg>
<seg id="32">"as ever before or since then, domestic appliances - including Louise Stanley, head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - the country's eating habits."</seg>
<seg id="33">"by adding recipes and articles published in newspapers and journals, they encourage women to become" budget spolitionists "and the challenge to turn paste like creamy spaghetti with carrots in delicious meals to be justified."</seg>
<seg id="34">"a Square Meal" is a feast of historic treats.</seg>
<seg id="35">"in particular, the reports about the answer of the government to the hungry citizens, as President Herbert Hoover Lass-me cake food posture."</seg>

<seg id="37">"he liked continental kitchen like fish with cucumber," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="38">He ate in a nearly gilded dining room and wore a tuxedo.</seg>
<seg id="39">He was wonderful realistic.</seg>
<seg id="40">"perhaps President Roosevelt should have committed the same mistake, if not his wife Eleanor had asked him to outfit it with his stomach."</seg>
<seg id="41">"as described in the book, a housekeeper with no interest in flavours by Mrs. Roosevelt said that the White House brought the bored food in Washington, but also one of them ready to prepare."</seg>
<seg id="42">"many of the species from the era of great depression, to deal with food, was discarded once the country came back to the legs."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food, Ziegelman said, as well as science was applied to foodstuffs."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in writing the book, the couple was better understood by the book the eating habits of Ziegelmans wife in law - for example, as they did not throw away food."</seg>

<seg id="48">"after the plates were cleared away at Eisenberg's, they went and cover a dessert that they had prepared at home: the plaumend, the president Roosevelt ate for lunch."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is called Prune Whip," "said Ziegelman and added that there was a common trick, a modest recipes to be missed."</seg>
<seg id="50">"there was no designed cream, only plums, some flour, sugar, water and cinnamon."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland haie usually come to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on the ship's vessel Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">"he was born in 1624 and swim with a 1 km / h, through the North Atlantic - until today."</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland haie received only 150 years offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they swim in Greenland at the bottom of the North Atlantic in an hour, in an hour he reaches an average of 1,220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it comes to it, the five metre long animal accelerates on a whopping 2.6 km / h - and it is half as fast as a Robbe."</seg>
<seg id="9">This kind of loneliness-shaped lifestyle seems to be a sponsorship for a high age.</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues reported in the professional journal "Science" anyway of a Greenland who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commenting on the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock, the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"indeed, the evolutionary biologist presumed for a long time that Greenland."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence is missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland haie are difficult to observe, finally they live mainly in the ice-sea from Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive in the surface only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers have very little to know about the lifestyle of Greenland's haie.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her time bends breathless her, when they equivaled six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"this sharks make this sharks anyway: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a Robbe, another had swallowed up the jaw bones of a young kingdoms."</seg>
<seg id="19">Perhaps they hunt them sleeping animals or patrol on the bottom of the iron ore and search for Kadaver who torches up from higher water layers after bottom.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 in front of Greenland or Svalbard as a bycatch of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502-centimetres is measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">To determine the age of the animals evaluate it with the Carbon-14 method the lens core of sharks.</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens arises from the birth of sharks, which contained in it no longer later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a lot of Carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"after the early 1960s, their birth should lie in the late 1960s when atomic tests experiments greater amounts of this radioactive carbon in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in contrast, with 220 centimeters length of the third smallest animal, the lens core contained a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, which is likely to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all bigger Greenland-sharks had a normal carbon-14 quantities, which is produced by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 watch for a 493 centimeters long Greenland was an age of 335 years while the record-shark should be even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-females can then get offspring when they are longer than four meters, it was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to arrange the length of the length."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters, probably at the threshold of the sexually mature and his age was determined 156 years, Greenland was obviously at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">That is likely to be the world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusales live mainly in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211-year-old Greenland-whale, caught on the neck of a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught on Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to low temperatures, the body of the animals live on austerity glaze."</seg>
<seg id="36">"so, later, they tires slower."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in cold water, the animals are often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">Because the volume increases much faster than its surface due to the animal heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on, as soon as possible, as possible as many offspring as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist. "</seg>

<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick, after they came in March at the railway world cup in London despite the return of Hoys just a humble sixth place."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as hinder.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retire produced a gap that tried to close Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton.</seg>

<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong line-wheel team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to get a char to medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary depiction of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations were driven for Rio."</seg>

<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years runs in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the facility of Alcoa in Portland stand in the game."</seg>

<seg id="10">This step follows the years of speculation on the future of the plant originally as a result of the strong Australia dollar and last due to the electricity price for the system.</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melon with his Loy Yang A power plant in LatinValley, shared with that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the facility is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, including the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp smaller shares."</seg>

<seg id="14">"AGL continued to continue, that the contracts called" "securing transactions", "which would have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"contracts have a 12-month closing date, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"therefore, AGL assumes that the contracts in the fiscal year 17 will contribute to the revenue," said the power supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"all potential impact on the AGL revenues from the GJ 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of powerful dates for wholesale electricity prices."</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL told that it had already written the value of contracts in his annual turn of $187 million in" anticipation of termination "." "</seg>
<seg id="19">Alcoa said that the decision to make the treaties have the "Skiras..." to operate the melt or to ensure the power supply to the melting pot.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that it had completed a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have entered into force in 2010, even if it is still an explanation, why it has come from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts are warn due to the bad economic conditions of the industry before the possible closure of the Portland melting plant in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the analysts at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland is about 900 megawatts and Tomago consume about 900 megawatts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers from Erpressors-Malware are currently targeted companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of the malware defense specialists Malwarebytes, among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany last twelve percent of surveyed companies were at least once, partially several victims of a attack with Erpresser software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the aim of a ransomware narrative."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims are willing to benefit from the perpetrators required to use the required systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their depresser software according to the observations from Malwarebytes to attacks in company network.</seg>
<seg id="7">"they are successful there, the potentially likelp ransom is significantly higher than in private use."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we currently watch a scary fast evolution of pollutant software," explains Malwarebytes chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most carriers were still designed to send ads."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered Erpressation software for itself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the goal, but the change to corporate attacking took place in the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on the computer's computer, it is looking for continuously changing files like Word-, Excel- or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encodes the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software showcases the demands of the pressors."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the code key code to the files, the victims must pay money - usually in the form of cryptocurrencies bitcoin - indicate."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where in private use the personal photo database is on the game, it comes to companies around sensitive customer data or project databases without which the production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage fails when a ransomware suggests."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the affected German companies reported sales loss by Ransomware, 13 per cent had to interrupt the business activity, in case of a case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals were already threatening victims, whose patients can be threatened by the loss of hospital cacutely."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims: pay not, you promote only the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies that pay, get their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">Manager is difficult to reject the perpetrator for managers in view of a standstill.</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, F-Secure researchers examined the user interfaces and contact with the narratives and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually attempting to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"you will declare your victims by chat, such as they can pay by Bitcoin, free accessible support websites, or decrypting free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are saved by a few hundred euros, companies must also act hard to negotiate and pay five-digit sums to withdraw their data."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risk profits from the Ransomware Erpressum, the hackers become increasingly professional and share the work, explains security experts from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a single ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that it is three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malware software then in the form of an software structure to the actual erpressors.</seg>
<seg id="30">"the previous malware kits were created by buying the malware, advice and additional tools for one-time, fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the scope of delivery is a customization tool that can be changed smaller configurations, appearance and branding," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The Erpressors are then looking for further hackers to spread the fresh bought software under the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>
<seg id="34">"so, in one of the forums on the ground, the set buys from a criminals and commissioned the set to install the software on many computers as possible."</seg>
<seg id="35">Payment is done per insufficient calculator.</seg>
<seg id="36">"typically, the criminals then serve with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">The risk of Ransomware is now known for many companies that secure their data better.</seg>
<seg id="38">Over 50 percent of companies responsible for companies in the Malwarebytes survey to defend Ransomware using File Back-ups and Scannersoftware.</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already following new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone does not have sufficient threat to successful issuance, the perpetrators are instead using the release of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes chef Marcin Kleczynski instead. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"thus, the potential potential for the type of data is even higher than ever before."</seg>
<seg id="42">"in future, the perpetrators could take completely new goals to the internet of things on the grain."</seg>
<seg id="43">At the HackerConference Defcon demonstrate security researcher how they could have been associated with the Internet associated thermostat under their control.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in the middle of winter, the locking of a derart block heating so many victims would certainly be a ransom."</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the perpetrators then be blocking a whole production road instead of the heating in the future, Ransomware could also be a theme in Industry 4.0."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you'll be eternally awake, at night you wake up hours, in the morning there is no longer ponder to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all other than relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one of these issues is in good company: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about one quarter of adults sleep problems and more than 10 per cent empires their sleep often or permanently recovering."</seg>
<seg id="5">How can sleep problems or sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep problems, and there are differences of different causes, emphasizes Hans-Günter Weeß, board member of the German Society for sleeping and sleep medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands country among them, but the insomites is never, i.e. an in- and sleek."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just trying to sleep through many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, Jens Wagenknecht, the board member of the German Home Medical Association with practice in the Lower Saxony-Saxon Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleeping disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, mental or behavioral factors behind it can be used, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">The sleep disturbance expression of another disease is not rare.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening, especially in depression is frequent," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that various factors go to one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can be poor, waking up every two to three hours and starts blurred, through everyday problems and worry, there is a example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you don't sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week, and the day should be impaired, advising the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look completely different: it is cut down, tired, ineworthy, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood changes or physical disorders such as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to relieve the sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"as treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioral therapy or even medications - classic sleep tablets only in exceptional case and no more for two weeks - inquire."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in Germany, Professor Ingo Fietze, Head of Interdisciplinary SleMedical Center of the Charité University Medicine Berlin, is hardly emphasized in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore you should first contact sleeping problems at home, advising Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">The problem may clarify whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should come into the sleep laboratory, and what happened?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the investigation in the sleep laboratory, medical advice, for example with snoring with respiratory failure, in case of disease-fatigue or if you do not find the cause of a sleeping disorder, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">You do not need to prepare for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a lunch break," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after driving, one goes into bed at its normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes in the body one can carry on the nose goggles, chest strap and an antennas at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera stands on the ceiling to sleep."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can I get the problems in the handle?</seg>
<seg id="34">"there are rather many actuators, in which one can place for better sleep."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeß is counting on: regular bedrooms and rise times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, not watch TV to sleep, alcohol do not take up at the watch - then you start to count immediately, and that is quite and not conveyed at all."</seg>

<seg id="5">"article about this" trendy neighborhood, "such as the competent estate company Friedrichshain calls, however, will be preferred by burning cars in the last weeks."</seg>
<seg id="6">"reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents were rent tensions, but on the ground floor, however, rooms are still occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year Berlin, particularly of the Berlin's inner-scale preventer, it was extremely difficult for the police against the project as" no-go-zone "for policemen and 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after on 22 June the rooms were cleared out on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers were patated, patrol the police three weeks ago, spersed parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">Meanwhile renovated building workers in order of unknown houseowner the rooms.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the spatiality had been illegal, and a day later, police and construction workers moved by sympathizers and inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about a late late night."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in close proximity of the hood, a primary school and kindergartens are located."</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many people: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiev since 1999, and Jana *, who devout here three children, mainly from the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the hood, they share care of increasing domestic and centrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a pine that sums up mainly polishing protection against the left-andalous left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Graben, the Berlin's Internal Market and the Police between Hausetzals and their neighbours, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">Friedrichshain in the East Berlin was actually a traditional working class that has also today compared to the rest of the city a lower average income and high poverty risk.</seg>
<seg id="18">"also houses of home projects and the newborn residential projects have already been in a lot for a long time: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied by the former GDR, including nearly all the whole mainframe near the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been cleared under large police station, many of the projects were legalized in the Rigaer and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district in the last years has become increasingly becoming the magnets for tourists and election liners from all over the world: with them, people from GDR times and former home-insurers share their jaw."</seg>
<seg id="21">This is also noticeable in the rents that has increased by almost 60 percent since 2009.</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them in designed slices or freshly painted facades that were thrown with dye.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year together with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"a reason for that not all neighbours can be considered a problem, that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes such as body infringement, according to statistics, almost exclusively against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the most important part of the offences make nonfiction, which tends to meet the newbuildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who resides for 17 years in a rental house beside the controversial 94, cannot be a matter of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is important: the people in the 94 are their neighbours, which have not been determined."</seg>
<seg id="28">There is also the famous burning cars directly in the Rigaer no longer.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studying architect, her road is not a criminal point, on the contrary:" here one helps each other, lives together on the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately moved to the Rigaer street - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"therefore, it was also so important that the people had returned their streets: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">But in the eyes of residents like Neugebauer the road will continue to take away: by sighted new buildings in former construction lgaps that oppress old residents.</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately the property flats, which are not interesting for many here - here are rather people who are not so well-called," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"violence and destruction can I absolutely not gutheirs."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what to do if one never stops any anybody?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, also with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for breeding, which were annoying about colour bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer gave little understanding: the skin projects and the left side belonged to the Kiez."</seg>

<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can jump on board and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central, that the refugees get the feeling of being in Germany, and welcome."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long term of procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you must explain the refugees that it will take time, and it takes the time to overcross it, for example, language courses."</seg>

<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question, the policy is disappointing."</seg>
<seg id="59">Actually it is unfair to place them helpers on the spot.</seg>
