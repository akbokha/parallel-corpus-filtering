Obama receives Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not just friend@@ liest .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement and Tehran to dest@@ abil@@ ise dest@@ ab@@ ili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
but the meeting is supposed to have the conflict with the Palestinians and the discussed two @-@ state solution .
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been ten@@ sion@@ ed for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the contin@@ ual settlement of Israel and pays homage to the peace process of peace .
&quot; by Obama &apos;s deal to deal with the Iranian nuclear programme , the relationship between the two continues to wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu announced an invitation to the invitation to the US Congress which was partly given as Aff@@ air against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken by Obama , a meeting held this with regard to the forth@@ coming elections in Israel . &quot;
Professor pointed out in an emergency call to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ annon appeared with a slightly cr@@ ammed voice of the police to shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; Lamb was important to emphas@@ ize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; still live and probably excited , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman might be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house , the officials found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss and a handwritten note , which was crit@@ ici@@ zed on a white Block : &quot; I &apos;m so sorry , I could guess it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was after information of the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that lamb , who had travelled into two online courses for the Delta @-@ University in Cleveland , Mississippi , who had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he had killed and killed about 300 miles for the school , according to the police , he was killed and killed on the door of his office . &quot;
Delta @-@ University Poli@@ kl@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford told that all university employees have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that lamb made the cat@@ astro@@ phic not@@ ebook at some point after which he did .
by the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life when the police beat him .
&quot; one day after the shooting in the university , the students and lec@@ turers &apos; forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the agents at the two ends of the state , as did what students and employees who knew him , helped him out a picture of a talented , but maybe difficult teachers . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his teaching .
&quot; police in G@@ auti@@ er , where Pr@@ ent@@ e@@ iss died , said he did not have a story of violence or criminal history . &quot;
&quot; in a book written by him , Schmidt was mentioned in a book written in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people , &quot; whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both trained in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose apprenti@@ ces has 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time some in@@ clin@@ ations were too problem@@ atic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Bran@@ don Be@@ aver , the lamb bet@@ r@@ oth@@ ed , said that he was too excited and nervous , as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had told to deal with stress at the end of 2014 academic year . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta @-@ University to be asked for a care for health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
&quot; this year , he only had two online courses . &quot;
&quot; to develop the latest changes in the employment policy of the university , that the promotion , for the lamb had worked so hard for him , would be no guarantee for an automatic way to indicate as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge , he did not know anything about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
these are questions that does not answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs when he entered the Mississippi from Arkan@@ s@@ as again . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , he killed himself with a .@@ 38 Cali@@ ph pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his parents &quot; house on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car ran still in the entry .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why I went to this house , but Johnson said that she knew he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; in 2009 , Lamb opened his work at the university in 2009 , the 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12,000 inhabitants and taught geography and ped@@ agog@@ y . &quot;
he graduated in the spring of ped@@ agog@@ y .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
Carla Hair@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb had 20 years when they met together through joint friends .
&quot; they and their friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried some years to teach her guitar . &quot;
he was at the time of women &apos;s sho@@ al .
&quot; all the girls were wi@@ ped away when he was there , &quot; said Hair@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Bran@@ don . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ ent@@ iss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named lightning , who lived with them in the brick house which ad@@ mits to a Ba@@ you in G@@ auti@@ er . &quot;
the police told that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ ent@@ iss , Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends had stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
they and their mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he has never met lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and playing blues . &quot;
&quot; at the age of three years , he met Pr@@ ent@@ iss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail came up both in a summer fair . &quot;
&quot; later on , they played together one or another gig . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , his daughter wrote and sings her own music . &quot;
Pr@@ ent@@ iss was a nurse that worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a b@@ art@@ ender and sometimes convers@@ ational coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated bar close to G@@ auti@@ er , said that he had finished Christmas and Pr@@ ent@@ iss Night at night 5 . September last time he had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ious influ@@ x . &quot;
there was no evidence that something was not right .
&quot; just a happy pair , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clean and have fun together .
I mean they both had a good sense for jo@@ king .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , directed the first semester program program and specialized in American orig@@ ines and colonial history , said Don Allan Mitchell , an English @-@ Professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Emp@@ oria State University in Kansas and was President of its Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta @-@ campus in Cleveland , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ memorial service . &quot;
Sch@@ mid@@ ts &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part in the vig@@ il and sang along the &quot; B@@ right Morning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ For@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Rog@@ el@@ io Soli@@ s report from Cleveland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Editor Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had shot the emergency , when he described Schmidt from his emergency call , but there was no indication of that the two ever had married . &quot;
toys Mac Us plans to recru@@ it less workers for Christmas season
&quot; the Toys R Us states that it will not be so many christmas @-@ seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products retail@@ er says that he is currently working with employees and seasonal workers as a chance to work for more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is planning to set 40,000 people in shops and distribution centers throughout the country . during the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 employees were set to work . &quot;

&quot; while the holidays are still valid until months , the Christmas store is approaching , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p stores with employees who sell , send and send shops and products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox is talking about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a big moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat is empty beside me , and it becomes quite clear to me that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for a upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to me in the sense that I am a sim@@ ulated guest , and an arm length away from being with the prin@@ cess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presenting interviews with Fox , Lea Thom@@ pson and Christopher Lloyd , as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and the producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; had its premiere 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; Un@@ str@@ ingent of the biggest travel trip movie ever shot . &quot;
back in Time &quot; will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and selected cinemas in October . &quot;
&quot; UN boss says , there is no military solution in Syria &quot;
Secretary @-@ General Ban Ki @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s reinforced military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; that lasted almost five years of conflict and more weapons are affected by violence and mis@@ ery for millions of people .
&quot; the UN leader once again calls upon all the parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite oneself and support integral negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France , to meet the situation in Syria at the mar@@ gins of the general meeting . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that att@@ itudes within the Council and of the Syrian people , and the Regional Po@@ wers &quot; must make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot;
&quot; ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in Syria , with the filing of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 res@@ ent values that show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have attempted to brand him as a flop .
others have done it than a joke .
and some wait for a collapse .
&quot; however , no matter how some Rep@@ ublic@@ ans try to drag Donald Tr@@ ump from the top speeds of p@@ olls , it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven National olls showed Donald Tr@@ ump in double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask oneself what it means for the chance to nomin@@ ate the real estate business . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tr@@ ump may probably gain the Republican nomin@@ ation .
experts have emphas@@ ized that at that time Rick Per@@ r@@ ys was handed over leadership to the asc@@ ending Herman Cain in 2011 none of which won only a state in the Nomin@@ ation process .
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
&quot; but outdoor groups like Je@@ b Bus@@ es Super P@@ AC and the conservative business group Club for Growth is now able to detect tr@@ um@@ ps per@@ sever@@ ance and start to drain off her dollar , to t@@ opp@@ le him . &quot;
here are some current fra@@ gment levels that indicate that the real estate Mog@@ ul is not just a temporary phase :
Tr@@ um@@ ps Belie@@ fs have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; just before Donald Tr@@ ump left his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans saw the real estate Mog@@ ul . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump .
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
&quot; a fifth week of Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has found that 60 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump . &quot;
two thirds of GO@@ P elec@@ tors GO@@ P would be happy with tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a survey of CNN / OR@@ C last week , 67 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans , they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied , &quot; if Tr@@ ump would have been nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of 10 say they were &quot; sc@@ and@@ alized , &quot; if he was the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son manages roughly the same enthusiasm like Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; excited &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next time in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of the Republican elec@@ torate , they would &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; sc@@ and@@ alize , &quot; if Je@@ b Bush , the Fav@@ or of the Est@@ abl@@ ishment , was the candidate . &quot;
a majority of rep@@ ublic@@ ans can not see Tr@@ um@@ ps temper@@ ament no problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely used for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of the rep@@ ublic@@ ans believe that real temper@@ ament shows the right temper@@ ament to the president , as ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first hier@@ archy of the nation , State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of rep@@ ublic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a supreme commander , loud to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to be effective for his office , and for nearly six out of 10 recru@@ itments tell that his temper@@ ament was not in the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republican elec@@ tors get used to the idea .
&quot; if they rely on their schol@@ ar , republi@@ can voters stop the real ump . &quot;
&quot; when they get asked who wins the lowest GO@@ P nomin@@ ation , a survey of CNN / OR@@ C from the past week goes four out of ten that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
&quot; this is a change since the time , when four from ten at the end of July her money was put on Je@@ b Bush . &quot;
full dis@@ closure : GO@@ P voters do not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten rep@@ ublic@@ ans reported that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nomin@@ ation against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it shows that a large variety of GO@@ P @-@ voters can view the campaign being plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the rep@@ ublic@@ ans gathered to join another Can@@ didates , Tr@@ ump continues to work . &quot;
some experts as@@ sign that the frac@@ tory field probably contributes to Tr@@ um@@ ps leadership as opposed to more than a dozen other candidates diff@@ us .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head between Tr@@ ump and most other republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump is losing its majority . &quot;
&quot; he placed 13 points ahead of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Je@@ b Bush 19 points and finally ahead of margin Paul , John Kas@@ ich and Chris Christie 33 . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head @-@ race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate that sm@@ ites him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepren@@ eur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head .
a bald majority by Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ fans says they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a recent survey of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of the voters , who support the ump , say that they have received their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , a lot can happen to change that , and no one can really say the opinion . &quot;
46 per cent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tr@@ um@@ ps is the strongest competition at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but elec@@ tors they say that they have formed their opinion , are twice as often for tr@@ ump . &quot;
six of 10 Rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the ump on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump has been working on his campaign for immigrants from Mexico &quot; rape , &quot; immigration and the possibility of fishing in the public dis@@ course in 2016 has been released by Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic cut@@ ters of Tr@@ ump @-@ Hisp@@ ano @-@ Americans will keep away from the Republican Party and damage the re @-@ oriented efforts .
&quot; but after the new ABC / post survey conducted on Monday , six of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say that they coinci@@ de with the ump on immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spot@@ light , Donald Tr@@ ump doesn &apos;t seem to do so . &quot;
the fru@@ stration concerning the government clim@@ bs to new high@@ s .
&quot; by now , on Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son , he accounted for about half the Republican elec@@ tors support , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 rep@@ ublic@@ ans say in the new mon@@ day survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ si@@ der than someone with government experience . &quot;
they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey carried out by Des Mo@@ ines register / Bloomberg in Iowa , two weeks ago , showed that three of four Iowa Rep@@ ublic@@ ans have been fru@@ str@@ ated by 54 percent , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ afe &quot; and 21 percent . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co. : the five most exclusive residential districts in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ oo@@ ken@@ weg path is the most expensive residence - with a view over the North Sea basin .
&quot; in the street , one square metre of a roof apartment costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; the range of objects is limited according to Sy@@ lt , meaning it is in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
&quot; a new study shows , in which particular areas it will cost a square most square . &quot;
&quot; of course , 18,@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; unlike Germany &apos;s top locations , one of the prices shall be as Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
&quot; the real estate providers angel &amp; Völk@@ ers published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential sites , with square prices in a dizz@@ ying heights . &quot;
&quot; there are several tens of thousand euros per square meter , well @-@ noted . &quot;
but well who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is out of the top here .
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Mu@@ eller and Göt@@ ze
two @-@ fold go@@ al@@ sc@@ orer in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has simply a run .
&quot; a happ@@ ier hit by Thomas Müller served the way to a well served 3 : 0 at the Pi@@ raeus &apos;s Olympic team , where he ran . &quot;
a sovereign pre@@ lu@@ de of the Champions League @-@ season .
the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze celebrated a dream start in the &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; with the Bayern District Court of Pi@@ raeus .
the team of coach P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their opening play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to tr@@ ash double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and Göt@@ z hits ( 8@@ 9. ) deserves with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola is finally trying to pick the h@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race .
&quot; at his 28 hits in the Champions League for Bavaria @-@ guided Mi@@ th@@ aid from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ wart Roberto , who was going to pass a race @-@ like shot of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; the Bayern @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 fans - and the Munich @-@ based word prevailed . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated not@@ ion without shiny .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus having gained six home games in the Royal class , including against prominent clubs as Manchester United , Atl@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , this also stum@@ bled into Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Bavaria , defeated in seven Europe @-@ up Du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victims . &quot;
&quot; however , they went cour@@ ageous to work in their vig@@ orous effort , but often too inv@@ inci@@ bility . &quot;
the attacks were often brought to the border on Lin@@ ks@@ and@@ on Douglas Costa and had rarely been carried out against the former Braun@@ schwei@@ ger Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Mu@@ eller had moved far more luck than his fl@@ ank from the right hemisphere at the left @-@ left side .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the potential 2 : 0 . &quot;
Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski &apos;s best occasions in half had Robert Le@@ wand@@ owski .
first presented as Olympics @-@ falls of ide@@ ye Brown the head@@ ball of the Pol@@ es on the line ( 26 ) .
&quot; then by direct transfer , Tor@@ ch Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
although Bavaria is home to domin@@ ate it was able to set sail pi@@ racy .
but at Tor@@ hil@@ ly Manuel Rein@@ a was a Dec@@ ree .
&quot; thus , when he turned a shot of ide@@ ye on the bar ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; recently , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola made a four @-@ seater with David Al@@ aba in the centre next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sitting first outside . &quot;
&quot; the world championship hero had only given the green light after finishing the final ining of the World Championship , MEP Matthias Schau@@ mer said to &quot; &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; who wants to make something different from it is quite mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; on the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for a distant Le@@ wand@@ owski ( 59@@ . ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6. ) and made 13 minutes later all clear , by El@@ f@@ m , Müller served one step further . &quot;
ahead of the game there was finally in the stadium to tie .
&quot; after a small group of partly susp@@ ici@@ ously Bayern fans in their audience @-@ block apparently prov@@ oked the supporters of the hosts of Pi@@ raeus , with words and gest@@ ures , the security forces attacked and went with b@@ ang@@ ers against the Munich p@@ endants . &quot;
at least one Bavaria @-@ Fan was transported from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of loose teeth &quot;
&quot; those who smoke , not only harm the lungs , but also the teeth - that &apos;s a long @-@ term study near Potsdam . &quot;
the good news : at a failure the risk is rapidly .
smoking have a much higher risk to lose their teeth early .
&quot; this is drawn from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Food Studies ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to qu@@ itting smoking , smokers was at risk of losing their teeth at pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5 to 3.6 @-@ F@@ ah . &quot;
the scientist had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; cause of dental cause are cav@@ ities and infections of the g@@ ing@@ le , st@@ resses the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ tit@@ is , smoking is a risk factor , the authors emphas@@ izes the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and tooth loss is caused by frequent fl@@ es@@ g@@ ing@@ itis in smoking .
&quot; not being cleared , smoking is also increased the risk of cav@@ ities . &quot;
&quot; people who stopped smoking with smoking could reduce their risk during a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat comes back to the level of qu@@ itting smoking , the former director Thomas Dietrich , of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; people have to persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smoking , study leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; qu@@ itting smoking the living time . &quot;
not to smoke is good for lungs and recept@@ acles and leads to our knowledge as well as good dental health to the high age .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population are affected by mar@@ g@@ less@@ ness , the DI@@ f@@ E distributed over 20 percent of the population . &quot;
previous studies have already noted that smoking increases the risk for early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study comp@@ lies the findings .
archaeological excav@@ ation in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer le@@ aps from the late antique
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological findings have been found in the right Rhine river in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the construction site for the new Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ isches Museum skel@@ et@@ ons and rema@@ in@@ ders of historic buildings have excav@@ ated , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , histori@@ ans are on the search for so @-@ called floor monuments . &quot;
&quot; in all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always held as a specialist for archae@@ ology gardens . &quot;
&quot; in the third stage of construction of the Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ards , the arch@@ e@@ ologists have been found . &quot;
&quot; from text records it was already known that a fortress and a church had been standing at the place in the 4th century , and explained a church in Trier in the 8th century . &quot;
&quot; next to remains of the fortress and the church of Kir@@ g@@ oos , there was also a cemetery containing around 350 bones that probably belonged to the church . &quot;

EU Commission proposes in dispute over TT@@ IP a new trial
&quot; for the shar@@ pen@@ ing of the battle on the Tran@@ sat@@ l@@ antic Free Trade Agreement of TT@@ IP , the EU Commission proposed an extensive reform of the current arbit@@ ral system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private screening programmes for disp@@ utes between businesses and states are therefore due to be replaced by a transparent system , which corresponds to much more traditional dishes . &quot;
we want to set up a system that trust the citizens &quot; trust in EU @-@ Commissioner Cec@@ ilia Malm@@ ström soon .
the Swedish campaign has pre @-@ approved the proposal as a European negoti@@ ating position on the free trade talks in the USA .
the German government announced support .
the TT@@ IP is the largest free trade zone in the world with 800 million people .
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings are outlined in particular that the EU states and the USA will jointly select independent judges for a new investment court .

Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the prime minister of the Prime Minister
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut is expected with tension at the prime minister of Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; in his debut with David Cameron , the new Labour leader Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n is designed for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to the first of his six given questions shortly after noon , with what his performance of the media most likely and the Labour MPs will be checked out of the vicinity . &quot;
he called &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could ski@@ p a few meetings to leave them colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary examination for Mr Cor@@ p@@ se &apos;s leadership , as it comes to being a member of the Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ in@@ let and after his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour chairman , at a commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , critic@@ ises criticism from a number of T@@ ory @-@ M@@ PS , at the heart of several cover pages @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ l &apos;s decision , not to sing the National An@@ them , attracted attention to himself &quot;
a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had stood &quot; respec@@ t@@ ful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; Hel@@ ium around the Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ ab@@ in@@ ett , Owen Smith , told in the BBC Two news interview , he led the Labour Party to sing the national hy@@ m@@ ne , &quot; independent &quot; of his faith that the monarchy should be abolished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , and she is called on differences in the economy , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Parliamentary Party supported him as a leader . &quot;
&quot; the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences may also be &quot; stap@@ ling within Labor &quot; and , according to Mr Cor@@ lob@@ in &apos;s statements , to the position of the European Union and the limit on winners . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n told the TU@@ C conference , Labour changes to remove the whole idea of a limitation . &quot;
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of Occup@@ ation and pensions , said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it would only be against the government plan to lower the limitation of 26@@ ,000 £ to 23@@ ,000 £ . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n is the fifth Labour leader being leader David Cameron , since he has been CEO &apos;s T@@ ory leader , has over the past decade of Disp@@ atch @-@ Box in Parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different policy of policies , says that he has given &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions of Mr. Cameron and has given him more than 30,000 ideas . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ lington North MP has said that the prime minister of the Prime Minister is con@@ front@@ ally , and that it will under@@ take both &quot; impact &quot; and the stre@@ ak with resistance , and instead , focusing on serious problems such as poverty , ine@@ quality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economic adviser , is represented by him if he is not particip@@ ates - for example when Mr. Cameron is on the road abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation , that other colleagues often seize the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he was leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron announced that he wants to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le The@@ aters &quot; that often has been linked to the prime minister of the prime minister . but some years later he admitted he has failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was sent on TV first in 1990 , the freight @-@ wound was viewed as the most important bar@@ omet@@ ri@@ ment of a leader and his position under his par@@ liam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argu@@ ed that they became a caric@@ ature , and require re@@ sufficient reforms . &quot;

&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index concluded with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6.@@ 2@@ 29,@@ 21 . &quot;

the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Co@@ w@@ g@@ ill says that there could be a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; more purchasing power in the potential customers . &quot;

&quot; the cost could also meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;

Met@@ allic starts ground resistance campaign to fight Al@@ di@@ - in@@ fest@@ ation
met@@ a tries to protect IG@@ A stores in front of a Al@@ di increase in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler &quot; Met@@ cash has launched a ground @-@ loss campaign to defend the market share of IG@@ A retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di opens the opening of two sales centres and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , strengthen Met@@ cash and IG@@ A markets their relationships with local food suppliers , and build the brand IG@@ A through mainstre@@ am marketing and marketing relating to soci@@ etal media , as well as events such as Adelaide Show . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer decor@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , distributed in IG@@ A stores and shop owner who sold the remaining tickets for the South Australian football League to faithful customers . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ allic further details of his defense strategy is expected to be published on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler being involved in food , alcohol , and devices through the yearly funding strategy . &quot;
it is much at stake where South Australia and Western Australia comprise almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A shop shops and generate higher profit mar@@ gins as the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s IG@@ A network in the eastern states .
&quot; buyers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ally provincial and IG@@ A retail@@ er have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland , more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia , compared with about 14 percent in eastern Australia . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stanley observed that Al@@ di was s@@ nat@@ ured for twelve months after opening his first markets at the food market in these two states and all existing actors , but mainly independent retail chains . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the Analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stanley was estimated that IG@@ A retailers can lose 360 $ million sales per year and € 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and generate sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in the food and gro@@ c@@ eries and the quantities on met@@ c@@ ash@@ s could cost € 13 million , before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath stated . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ ering market shares lost in the eastern states , mainly in Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey of Roy Morgan had found that IG@@ A buyers are the faithful ones . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stanley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s rate sales in food and grocery by 3.8 per cent in 2016 to 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2,1 % in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 per cent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund managers Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told a business in Melbourne that it is likely to disappear within a decade . met@@ ering will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash refused to respond to the comments of Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass was in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , IG@@ As &apos;s market share has gone down from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflected in its operating debt reduction for similar pressure on sales and mar@@ gins . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ al@@ ers , however , attract more than 150 million dollars to al@@ ign selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths for hundreds of products each week and deliver a better choices of fresh food and deliver a better selection of private @-@ label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s main managing director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the prices and store solutions to Elan grew and hopes that the wholes@@ al@@ ers will return to profit growth in four years for the first time in 2017 .
&quot; the President of the Australian tennis network Steve He@@ aly is supported by the President of the Australian tennis network , Steve He@@ aly &quot;
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deser@@ ved more praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his behavior .
&quot; Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; coll@@ ater@@ al damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gios and deser@@ ted with the President of the Australian tennis Federation Steve He@@ aly rather praise as a cr@@ iti@@ que for his own behavior . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ k@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented Du@@ os , who is still referred to as &quot; special KS , &quot; got into the spot@@ light with St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fier@@ y qualifying match in Cincinnati shortly afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent Ryan Harrison twice had to be separated by the refer@@ ee , whereby Harrison wrote : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to strike C@@ yr@@ gios , and I should strike the child . &quot;
&quot; last seen , as he was seen as a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cr@@ amp@@ f dec@@ eit@@ ed a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended from He@@ aly . &quot;
te@@ ens is currently in Glasgow at the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth to perform second place in the single past Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ finals against Great Britain .
&quot; one thing about which I av@@ al@@ im@@ ed me is the fact that after my opinion , Than@@ asi was a little bit worried about the war , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he ra@@ ged one ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cr@@ amp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who broken a ra@@ cket from fr@@ ying with himself , and I know Than@@ asi is good enough to know that he is not proud of that . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has played extremely well in the US Open , even under the quite pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances involving Harrison and so on and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around himself , he has a great family around himself , and I think he was a little hard to treat . &quot;
&quot; he is a very young 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he goes into the team and so on , he never respects a problem with the other players he is well beha@@ ved in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves it to be judged on his own services . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly is also supporting the decision , C@@ yr@@ gios on the important pre@@ limin@@ aries , which begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right for everyone , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; at first we wish that the team is completely focused on the competition and not all control around &#91; C@@ yr@@ gios &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I think Nick has made very quick to climb up the rise , which people like Feder@@ er and Murray . he is rising in the eyes of the public , and he has made some hin@@ ts bugs which he gets , but we are trying to think him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it &apos;s the best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
&quot; Hungary explains the emergency and war@@ med the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday , and stopped all the people trying to be illeg@@ ally into the country . everything related to the aim to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
chaos following the border when hundreds of migrants acted in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acted to Serbian officials .
&quot; people who had fled from violence found themselves on an unknown time in a country strip on the street between the two control points of the countries and built tents , and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations went on .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ w@@ led against them , the migrants &apos; open@@ er the border ! &quot; and they cried out ins@@ ults against the Hungarian ri@@ ot police . &quot;
some pointed out of protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared that it would be &quot; un@@ acceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would come back while driving more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a coll@@ ateral damage .
&quot; in the days ahead of talks with Brussels and other countries , I@@ vic@@ a Dac@@ ic said in Prague . &quot;
&quot; the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came home a day after the 28 nations block at a controversial meeting in Brussels , no common immigration policy could be agreed . &quot;
&quot; the minister agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who had refuge in the shr@@ ank of Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached by more than 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on Tuesday a special summit in the European Union to discuss the migration crisis of the continent .
&quot; Hungary , however , won &apos;t its hopes for a private action of Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency emergency on Tuesday posted more powers to the crisis in two southern regions , so that they were able to accelerate their streets and asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to said , that his country also plans to build a bar@@ bed wire on his border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants caused by the country - after finishing a fence along the Serbian border . &quot;
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata told that even he had been used for prison in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East , Hungary has become a considerable bott@@ len@@ eck and an entrance to the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insi@@ sted that most of the upcoming economic refugees are , in search of a better life , and non @-@ war refugees who are entitled to protection - a view that is strongly in contra@@ diction to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , coming to Hungary at midnight , will make crossing the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ uns , whom the government issued along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also lay up higher custody for the traff@@ ick@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; owing to the situation which arose by mass migration , the Hungarian government declared emergency state , &quot; said Speaker Z@@ ol@@ tan Kov@@ acs Rep@@ orters in the southern town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illeg@@ ally Border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military , which is expected for next week , but rep@@ orters of Associ@@ ated Press have been physically seen on the border with vehicles and dogs . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security adviser to Or@@ ban , said that authorities were 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across by damaged the fence , they are now in custody and is accused of crimes committed by the new laws . &quot;

a further group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would not be able to stay food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in a national pol@@ l
&quot; the State Secretary of State Hillary Clinton still holds a double @-@ digit margin in democratic race around the nomin@@ ation at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders win over the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate in the local elections ( 58 per cent before ) , while S@@ anders is in second place , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; Vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced he received the presidential ministry , receives support of 15 percent of the presidential elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the preliminary elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion exists , which candidates they will support them . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are in their choice than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News pol@@ l , Clinton had lost a number of demo@@ graphic groups while selling some win@@ nings . &quot;
Clinton holds a big lead in women and vegetables but they have reduced their jumps .
&quot; their support in men is significantly reduced , and S@@ anders can only return with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s benefit in democratic voters , under the age of 50 , ins@@ ed themselves , and they and S@@ anders are now on the same height . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , has a big lead in the older elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in the last month , Clinton was a double @-@ digit margin towards the Liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point advantage in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters call in the country &apos;s general elections , that they would support us with enthusiasm when they were nominated by the party . &quot;
&quot; one quarter would support it with some , and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the Can@@ didate . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
maybe Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are all enthusiastic about her .
the views are stronger with those who do not support Clinton - just about one quarter would support them enthusi@@ ast@@ ically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , say fewer Republican elec@@ torate , on their leading candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; when Clinton &apos;s supporters asked in a open question , why they want them to be the candidate , is the most common reason that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clin@@ t &apos;s support , Bill Clinton ( 9 per cent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
approval by handling problems and voters are also cited .
&quot; as the vice president acc@@ uses the presidency for the presidential office , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race -- though a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; when democratic voters are being questioned , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
among Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half that Bi@@ den had their second choice far off S@@ anders .
&quot; if bi@@ den decides not to can@@ di@@ zing the nomin@@ ation of the Democrats , Hillary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of S@@ anders , 20 points with Bi@@ den in racing at 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chance to win the election , but this figure has dropped from 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; the gap is by far a second in this measuring , but the percentage that be@@ holds him than the &quot; choice &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , at the question of being more important , Democratic voters call for questions about the eligi@@ bility . &quot;
&quot; similar to last month , no single democr@@ at@@ ant candidate or potential candidate for this elec@@ torate in the local elections are un@@ acceptable . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic candidates , or potential applicants , provide good results with some important features of voters for voters . &quot;
&quot; add maj@@ orities to Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ den as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy and with strong guides . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best with hon@@ esty , while Clin@@ t &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , twice as many say that about His ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic turn@@ out of the general election in general Clinton , S@@ anders , and Bi@@ ological ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions concerning Hillary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server for foreign ministers , most of the Democratic voters are happy with their declaration of the matter and say that their opinions has not influenced in total . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; more than half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only about one @-@ third are satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion this happened in March , shortly after the problem was reached on light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail contro@@ versy no effects on their general views of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion was still wor@@ sen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; there are mainly Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say that their views of Clinton are worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is viewed by the voters of their party as tru@@ st@@ worthy and tru@@ st@@ worthy , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and tru@@ st@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled voters do not hold them for an honest and trusted object .
at the same time 55 percent of the nation@@ alized countries also see Tr@@ ump as non @-@ honest and not tru@@ st@@ worthy .
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good notes on guidance . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush are best with hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority seek@@ eth S@@ anders rather than tru@@ th@@ fully , but as at Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 351 Democratic voters at the local elections is 6 percentage points .
&quot; Ben Car@@ son resi@@ sted at the nationwide survey behind Donald Tr@@ ump , too . &quot;
Ben Car@@ son lies behind Donald Tr@@ ump &apos;s latest survey on C@@ BS News / New York Times .
&quot; by the two candidates , half of the voters stayed in the new pol@@ l , and others will lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republican elec@@ tors continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers . the support is made up of 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted prior to Fox News debate in the past month to 27 % in the survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son shot from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well on demo@@ graphic groups and exceeds the ump of Republican elec@@ tors , higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of Car@@ ly Fior@@ ina and Ohio Governor John Kas@@ ich , is beaten with Wis@@ con@@ sins governor Scott Walker , who is the lowest since then 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Florida governor Je@@ b Bush , former Governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are 6 % third place . &quot;
the bug@@ fix for the sample of 3@@ 76 people of rep@@ ublic@@ ans in this latest survey is plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the recent CNN / OR@@ C survey , which was released last week , shows that Car@@ son falls to the p@@ olls , he managed to support 19 % support from the Rep@@ ublic@@ ans , behind the ump with 32 % support . &quot;
&quot; the latest survey of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tr@@ ump clearly , before Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; with a view over one in the last week &apos;s Rising Car@@ son found Tr@@ ump found some side bars for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son taught himself to ask Tr@@ um@@ ps belief in question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in Iowa . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College N@@ ul@@ ings bur@@ dened
&quot; almost two years after a student was handed over to a student union in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder claims against five people . &quot;
&quot; the members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si trial attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introduction rit@@ ual as in September 2013 , and delayed his transportation into the hospital , which has contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said that he had been loaded with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and has repeatedly been attacked , while he tried to pursue a frozen field on a destination . &quot;
&quot; after all , Mr. Den@@ g compl@@ ained about headache , then he fell un@@ conscious . &quot;
members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ fully and waiting for an hour before they brought him into a hospital like the police .
&quot; however , they had time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing to contact his symptoms of goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to seek Council , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members of ten@@ ds to hide and set the br@@ otherhood of the Brotherhood in principle about Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ kl@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not revi@@ ved , and he died in the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after a aut@@ op@@ sy report Den@@ g has been supplem@@ ented with bl@@ unt strength of injuries to head , tor@@ so and upper th@@ igh@@ s . &quot;
&quot; many families were destroyed by the Brotherhood of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 in the Sch@@ ik@@ anen , &quot; said Douglas F@@ ier@@ berg , a lawyer , the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Monroe recommended an indictment for murder of the third quarter for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also indicted for aggressive attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to make responsible persons responsible , but if there is an organization , which - officially or un@@ official - this has been sanc@@ tion@@ ed , then we will also consider those for account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood and the national Brotherhood has contra@@ sted their affili@@ ation to the local group .
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases the interest
&quot; interest @-@ increase is made , and the fish will get into the desert , increase yields of bonds , and the economy will lead to recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know how long will it take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only small guidance on the procedure . &quot;
a recession came within only 11 months after the first interest rate of interest and lasted for 86 months .
&quot; the aggressi@@ veness of the Federal Reserve at lifting the interest rates is often , although not always , a factor such as the economy and the financial plants react . &quot;
&quot; hence , representatives of the US central bank were under@@ lined that investors should not concentrate on increasing their interest rates , but rather on the period used for norm@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , market participants may notice that all f@@ uss could possibly exagger@@ ate for an interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inev@@ it@@ ably be interpreted as a signal for the end of the &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian J@@ ess@@ op , Chief economist at Capital Economics , in a communication message . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradu@@ al return of U.S. interest at normal high@@ s but still on low level to lead to the seis@@ mic shock , which many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
&quot; here is a historical trends , based on historic trends , how some areas of the economy could react : &quot;
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , interest rate for interest rates for a while can be vol@@ atile . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatically . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that income must be concluded from 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which is perhaps reflecting the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German Bank analysts in a recent study , what is going to rate for interest rates in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is more precisely in the upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest rate hike , quite flat in the 250 days later ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal analysis , the Bob D@@ oll , chief investment strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , published at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank predic@@ ts that the effects on the stocks grew annually in the enh@@ ancing cycle and the return on that begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essi@@ on@@ ones are a fact of economic life , but interest rate is often promoting it often . &quot;
&quot; in current case , the F@@ ed is confron@@ ted with some conditions that didn &apos;t exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is close to its lowest point at an interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the rate of rate decl@@ ines in 118 by 118 percent since 1950 has been growing less than 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 stood at 3.6 percent , only few are expected that this will last and expect to rise by just 1.5 percent for the third quarter . &quot;
&quot; interest rates for a so frag@@ ile economic back@@ drop could be ris@@ ky and throw the question , &quot; whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants gathered for an interest rate of the F@@ ed for the year , and all eyes were on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee in this week , which ended on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading could only be a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all series cy@@ c@@ cy@@ c@@ lical cycles carried out from 1950 to today in a super cycle with increasing moment@@ um in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ essions were made fast after the start of recovery in the sha@@ dows &quot; , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a very slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is far the longest , which the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this date has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; the solid income was also vol@@ ati@@ l , since the market takes an interest rate , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares if it change its strategic course .
&quot; if bonds , the yields seem to change direction , as soon as the first increase / lowering are carried out in the cycle . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the Incre@@ asing cycle , bond yields are immediately drawn , said Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; strateg@@ ists from Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates will lead , resulting from extended and shorter period of bonds and lead to a decrease of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often bring better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still c@@ auti@@ ous to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come An@@ al@@ yst@@ in at Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , tells Jones that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation , there are some evidence that the market has adjusted to stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the earnings balance is fl@@ atter , lending ten@@ sion@@ ing and the vol@@ atility has increased - all characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed exac@@ erb@@ ate their strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and entire companies , it will increase the larger part of their business activities in the U.S. , benef@@ iting from if interest rates will rise and local products are attractive . &quot;
&quot; multin@@ ational corporations with high debt will be worse , as a growing dollar weak@@ ens their products on the global market more expensive and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to respond exceedingly positive three months after an initial interest @-@ rate hike , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sachs @-@ analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet overall increased by 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate , in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital ratios and lower vol@@ atility in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with lower quality by an average percentage of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts will become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the purely equity table , consumers are also benef@@ iting from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savings could see gains by higher earnings , even if experts are different , how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , &quot; said member of the committee Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
the Con@@ serv@@ atives as a member of Parliament crit@@ ici@@ zed the transmitter for &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; because of its &quot; stup@@ idity &quot;
it argu@@ ed that he is increasingly not to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also targeted at the BBC Music Awards and said they only responded to The Br@@ its
parliament collector Dam@@ ien Collins Cast the show The Voice to and said that this is not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , asser@@ ts a leading member of Parliament and increases new pressure on the transmitter to prove that it does not do something that does not do the private broad@@ caster . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ serv@@ atives , Andrew B@@ ingham , also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ sen that the public broad@@ caster &quot; ev@@ ap@@ or@@ me &quot; and increasingly not differ from his commercial opponent . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I do not use the word &quot; ev@@ um@@ men &quot; - but it seems to turn into Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was also targeted at the BBC Music Awards which began last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which began last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples of which you are actually only editing , which is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
&quot; BBC @-@ Director showed his accus@@ ations and argu@@ ed that BBC Radio 3 goes far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals , when it comes to live music and recon@@ na@@ iss@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , I will learn about classic music anywhere else . &quot;
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and playing music that &apos;s really un@@ matched .
&quot; and give the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and give new plants in order , I also really think of it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argu@@ ed that harder to har@@ den the audience when it did so in the past , because the British had less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production which ran in the committee on the selection of culture , media and sport for it under fire , to kick the commercial ri@@ vals on their feet . &quot;
the T@@ ory @-@ MP Dam@@ ien Collins Cast The Voice to - the musical talent @-@ show of the BBC which was purchased from Dutch producers Tal@@ p@@ Media for an estimated cost of 22 million pounds .
&quot; you see , why this program often is discussed because it is not original , and not especially distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George was a judge in a special BBC way .

net sales rose in August at the most slow@@ est and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
in the first three months of 2015 there were seven percent increase in online sales .
last month &apos;s lowest result since the start of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago through the use of mobile phones to shopping .
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed down its issues in November
&quot; for over a decade the virtual shopping is bo@@ oming , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have transformed into spirit cities . &quot;
experts predic@@ t that there are now signs that online sales were stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 .
&quot; the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the start of the records in 2000 , with only five percent increase from the previous year . &quot;
experts predic@@ t that there are signs that online sales are stag@@ n@@ ating after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for previous years and back up to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales edge to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he declared that the online sales increased three years ago , as buyers began to start with their cell phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people were able to buy online and that people could do this in different environments , such as at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that comm@@ utes itself , and we possibly will experience the growth . &quot;
&quot; the Black Friday phenomenon , which was imported from America , is quoted as a reason for the up@@ ending revenues . &quot;
experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases before this event which will take place last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some tra@@ ders are stor@@ med . &quot;
experts believe that Black Friday will stri@@ ve for the buyer because of bar@@ gain and buyers will keep making shopping .
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 spent a little bit more than £ 1 online .
&quot; in some products , such as TV and washing machines , more than one third of these purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people buys clothes and shoes online instead of the fashion chains . &quot;
Muslims were buried in Mec@@ ca at the crane accident of the accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family becomes sanc@@ tion@@ ed
the bodies of 29 dead are borne by Muslims in the first courses of Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia puts the collapse in part of the huge Saudi Bin Laden group to the burden .
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that , in total , 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collapsed . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of Muslims were gathered together , when 29 of the victims were borne through the streets to bury those who were killed when a crane of Mec@@ ca ap@@ or@@ am collapsed . &quot;
&quot; grapes filled , mostly in white clothed , the circuit to z@@ ha@@ ze their respect , when the first of the dead lived their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ a@@ isse@@ m @-@ cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the proc@@ ession wound in the Holy Place , where only days before a building kr@@ an over@@ threw the mosque and then on the st@@ ains . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for the funeral , when the Saudi King had taken over the build @-@ up of the bin Laden &apos;s build @-@ up because of the catastrophe , which left the latter with 3@@ 94 , a san@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the bodies of 29 beta car@@ ers , which were killed when a crane collapsed by the Great Central mosque in Mec@@ ca , were borne by the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the dead , Q@@ as@@ im Ak@@ ram was located in Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children who fell on his first pilgrimage to the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents at the beginning of the yearly H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi Official officials have already confirmed that the H@@ add@@ sch to Mec@@ ca will continue to pass , by thousands who continue to get to the city . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man , the bin Laden &apos;s bin Laden , would not have taken the arm of the crane , when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; a Arab version of the decree released by the State Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
the English @-@ speaking agency of the news agency did not report this detail but said that the company &apos;s leadership are prohibited .
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man laughed to reveal what the fall of the crane collapsed , which fell into a courtyard of the Groß@@ mos@@ ay , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims had taken place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued any statements on the collapse of the crane , and their representatives did not have their opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because they have not co@@ operated with meteor@@ ologist .
&quot; dozens of cranes are surrounded by Mek@@ ka great mosque as part of the massive building project , led by the bin Laden Group . &quot;
&quot; for decades , the bin Laden &apos;s family has joined Saudi Arabia as a host family and takes over bigger construction projects . &quot;
&quot; al Qaeda &apos;s late leader , Osama bin Laden , was a rebellious son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; overthrow of the crane came in the midst high winds and rain , only a few days before arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage that is at least once a life is needed each healthy . &quot;
officials said that 158 people stay in the hospital .
&quot; representatives from representatives showed that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4,000 ) are to pay to the families of the killed and the same sum to permanent injuries . &quot;
other injured will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss says that the time of the budget East European cra@@ ft@@ spe@@ ople are over
&quot; Br@@ its increasingly employ art@@ is@@ ans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe has increased
&quot; it will lead to that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops that aim at art@@ is@@ ans , will be opened at art@@ is@@ ans &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ fis@@ her 60 B &amp; Q sales will close nationwide . &quot;
&quot; from Ru@@ pert Steiner , City chief Cor@@ respon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
it is claimed that Britain is h@@ amm@@ ing their h@@ amm@@ ers and brush in favour of the use of qualified Eastern European craftsmen that work in their home .
&quot; if you are sk@@ ill@@ ful with a hammer or a brush to avoid walls , they appear to a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; Britain has increasingly occupied craftsmen , in order to perform DIY jobs at their houses , so the company &apos;s boss behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new director of King@@ fis@@ her , who owns the tree @-@ making chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled workers from Eastern Europe , offering services to low prices , has now been over@@ h@@ aul@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , King@@ fis@@ her , 200 more Scre@@ w@@ fix shop plans to open cra@@ ft@@ men and 60 sales points of B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten purchase decisions in the store are hit by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , men weigh the men . &quot;
&quot; she said it is necessary to set the growing demo@@ graphic trends , that feature more female single @-@ households that will perform more renovation than in the past . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches .
we have to move this stronger into a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consists of women with 80 percent of the decisions concerning the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in decision making .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also surrounded their top team , in order to reflect the same number of men and women in leadership positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ Fis@@ her is almost the only company , which has occupied about 50 percent of the teams with women , including his management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
Mrs. Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .

I use the function@@ ary of a@@ I / DO@@ B for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at Kl@@ agen@@ furt , Austria , on Wednesday , two officials of the Austrian volleyball ( Vice @-@ Master a@@ I / DO@@ B ) must have to answer for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and Ab@@ road ev@@ asion . &quot;
the accused were not guilty .
one of them was also charged with abuse of abuse .
he was acquitted of this accus@@ ation in May .
the current process was post@@ pon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the At@@ tor@@ ney General Robert Ri@@ ffel , she was cryst@@ all@@ ised in the preliminary investigation that the accused were able to sponsor signed for private purposes in the years 2006 to 2011 . &quot;
&quot; he b@@ ert the damage with around 400,000 Euro . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged on financial assets .
&quot; this fac@@ eli@@ ac was par@@ ted by the President of the Prosecutor , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence or@@ ised that there was no sign for the association at any time . &quot;
&quot; the sport function@@ alities only have been calculated and the sports club for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 and invested a lot of time and money in which liabilities were brought out by debt - the Passi@@ va ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we stood before the situation : let us move the club or block us ? &quot; , &quot; said one of the def@@ endants , in a bread professi@@ ons , in the bread professi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; with his colleagues and co @-@ accused , he decided to take this task . &quot;
with all the risks .
&quot; we have shed money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; he said in receipt . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a valid financial success , the payout of the im@@ bur@@ sement damage was retro@@ spec@@ tively adopted until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; so , since 2003 , when an increase was paid on the account , I have been paid out of the allowance for the first time . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the flat and non @-@ detailed orders seemed to be explained the processes . &quot;
the two def@@ endants over@@ took the accounts and sp@@ ell out the two def@@ endants together .
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als have not been revealed in detail for the association , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the club won &apos;t be interested in detail for financial support , important to only the debt of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , against the one function@@ ary investigation due to the abuse of officials , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; the accused were , declared the def@@ endants . &quot;
this securities account ran on the name of the second def@@ endants and was not known as the association &apos;s testimony .
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; wanted to know the judge . &quot;
the Be@@ acon didn &apos;t know a reply for a long time .
&quot; then he thought , he thought that this was the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something happens to him , nobody would have known something of this money , the prosecutor declared in the room . &quot;
the accused was informed of the function@@ ary of the function@@ ary .
this transfer was form@@ ulated as &quot; damages &quot; .
why off@@ ences ? if judge and prosecutor wanted to know attor@@ ney .
&quot; the first def@@ endant declared that he was not mis@@ understood by this for@@ ging , because the association never did a damage . &quot;
&quot; but what can I do if the lawyer says , &quot; You are all of the tail@@ or . &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the officials said that he never circul@@ ated a cent content , he only reck@@ ons o@@ fre@@ es and di@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; however , on di@@ ets he charged € 1,000 per month with the club , however , the real effort was much higher , he added . &quot;
exact documentation for the early years did not indic@@ t the def@@ endants .
&quot; these words were evaluated according to an establishment where everything was evaluated as correctly , no longer kept laid , they declared . &quot;
the second def@@ endant had also been involved .
&quot; all the resi@@ den@@ ces are made in cash , and he explained from his home town to the Bank to Abi@@ burg , he explained in his testimony . &quot;
the main hearing is continued on 23 September with the survey of witnesses .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard releases more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition , it has been running for three years , the Compu@@ Fo@@ am@@ ese will build further jobs by the establishment of the company . &quot;
the pitch @-@ read@@ ings in the US computer insul@@ ted He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not find an end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to mark the reduction of 25.000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of EUR 2.7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) will be saved by the company on Tuesday . &quot;
the step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars that will fall off from the fourth quarter .
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs in the past three years has not been completed yet . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP had some 30@@ 2,000 employees . &quot;
the race for the He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard @-@ Share was 2.3 percent .
&quot; today , the group based in the California based in Palo Alto , California , the computer and printing business is meant to be bund@@ led in a new company - separated from a promising areas with computer servers and data store for companies as well as other services . &quot;
both companies are expected to be listed on the stock market .
&quot; once again , a dis@@ appo@@ inting PC @-@ section as well as a weaker demand of corporate customers after his services rendered the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer to the Lenovo A@@ last . &quot;
&quot; in the third quarter of financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers decreased by 11.5 per cent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the revenues therefore went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a tigh@@ tening and massive circulation impact on the shift in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only re@@ acted to it that customers can buy smart phones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more shops directly online .
&quot; Whit@@ mans restructuring plans will see a total reduction of approximately 5@@ 5,000 jobs in total . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS education mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers in host@@ ilities in Iraq , but would largely be based on re@@ jection : 54 per cent said to it , 35 per cent did not agree . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other nations fly around the IS in Iraq and Syria , 61 percent are positive . &quot;
&quot; by contrast , 24 percent are inter@@ vening in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with the Syrian government , Bashar al @-@ Assad , 51 per cent of the respondents , would be 20 percent . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .

&quot; the organizer of V@@ DA by car can be reck@@ oned , just as two years ago with about 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence against Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police have deployed along the Serbian border at R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ tie and water ro@@ wers against several hundred accumulated refugees .
Eur@@ on@@ v &apos;s correspon@@ dent D@@ án@@ iel Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k experienced the non @-@ violent border crossing point .
he reported by phone :
&quot; in a group of refugees , the fron@@ tier broke through . &quot;
&quot; behind the police station , a polic@@ y@@ line was formed and behind police officers he was ready to build a water box . &quot;
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began to throw with stones , sticks and plastic bottles with the officials . &quot;
the officers were mostly un@@ broken pep@@ per@@ al .
afterwards the police used Tr@@ än@@ tie .
a lot of tram was spra@@ yed in the direction of refugees .
the Group was liqui@@ dated .
the refugees have now been re@@ tra@@ cted something .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
&quot; children , who had met the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees stum@@ bled in themselves and suffered under respir@@ ators .
the press races of the Serbian police suffered injuries by the use of lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as and pep@@ per@@ al spray .
&quot; time , the decision on interest rates for the U.S. emergency database &quot;
&quot; the world is watched as the US net spread over two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to meet the important decision , whether for the first time in almost a decade , interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey of 80 econom@@ ists who were interviewed by Reuters , found that a little more than half the last week of view was that the F@@ ed will do this , now consider that the F@@ ed will remain somewhat longer and the interest rates on this current state is 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years ago since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est has been on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we approach a situation where a large central bank is probably leaving the zero @-@ area and starts a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; says Angel U@@ bide , Leit@@ ner employee at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
the US economy is based on a relatively good performance level . trillion dollars are added to the balance and generate a low inflation .
&quot; however , the F@@ ed can &apos;t ignore the less ro@@ sy outlook on global relationships . &quot;
&quot; you warned the markets , to an increase , but the signs indicate that the opportunities are good against such a step . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 8@@ pm CET on Thursday .
death works at Delta State University left university education
&quot; after the shoot and killing of his girlfriend , Mississippi , on Monday morning , and before he killed his colleague and killed , wrote Sh@@ annon Lamb , a note to say that he would &quot; &quot; repent &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could not make it , &quot; &quot; gave public authorities on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in G@@ auti@@ er , Mississippi , said that Lamb , lecturer for geography and social scientific education at Delta State University , calling the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning . &quot;
&quot; and he said , shot on someone and killed someone . &quot;
&quot; Lamb suggested to the staff of the emer@@ gen@@ cies , that the police had to send a polic@@ emen to his home . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; is in the house , which but &quot; nobody will inter@@ fere , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb didn &apos;t provide a statement for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ ent@@ iss , 41 , and a handwritten note from Lamb , 45 , said : &quot; I am so sorry , I wanted to reverse it . &quot;
I loved Amy and she is the only woman who ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , he drove 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , killed before he finally took his own life on Monday night when police ra@@ ged him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge , he did not know anything about a conflict between lamb and Schmidt , but of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; in spite of reports on Monday , the Lamb believed that Pr@@ ent@@ iss already had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities on Tuesday , there was no information , no proof &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ pl@@ ying relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ ent@@ iss was told by Shawn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she was married for seven years as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ ent@@ iss have had a daughter , which is 19 , and she was &quot; destroyed &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said Pr@@ ent@@ iss their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; made online from home , according to statement by Lin@@ s@@ day Kno@@ w@@ les , who was identified as a close friend of Pr@@ ent@@ iss on Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend . &quot;
&quot; Kno@@ w@@ les said that Pr@@ ent@@ iss , who possessed a dog named Light@@ ning , met for about three years with lamb . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Kno@@ w@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb didn &apos;t refer to a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; he didn &apos;t go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when police arrested him on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville , he got up his car to the side and fled to foot , ran into the woods and killing himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in the spring of 2015 , Lamb received a PhD in the University of Delta State University , such as his c@@ ens@@ wear on the university &apos;s website . &quot;

Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa builds the Group around
the Lufthansa is planning a large consolidated facility .
&quot; with a better organization , the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros per year . &quot;
150 out of the world &apos;s around 1000 executives will cost the work@@ station building in the workplace .
&quot; with the pilot union , there are indirect negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa moves its business structure and evalu@@ ates the budget term Euro@@ wings .
the Bank &apos;s objective is to be an annual contribution to some 500 million euros a year from cost and income sy@@ ner@@ gies divided the airline on Wednesday .
&quot; among other things , the Lufthansa will no longer exist for passenger business . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings convenience line should be developed as independent as possible .
&quot; in the future of the Executive Board , CEO Carsten Spo@@ hr will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the future . &quot;
&quot; with the new setting , Spo@@ hr emphas@@ izes the importance of Euro@@ wings , which will in future wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and easy@@ jet . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees was complex . &quot;
the company &apos;s airlines are under the roof of the passage Air@@ line Group that exhibits three quarters of the 2013 annual turnover of EUR 30 billion .
new negotiations with the pilots
in terms of a pilot project of the pilot ( VC ) the negotiations are supposed to be resum@@ ed after the strike on this Thursday .
this distributed the union .
theme of dialog@@ s should be the rest for pilots .

the conflict between union and airline has led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transition maintenance , the pilot concept &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
it can be seen that Lufthansa is located in the fight against competitors as the company &apos;s own low @-@ cost airline bank@@ rupt@@ cies .

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double fac@@ ture
&quot; at the Champions League defeat of Manchester , the Champions League defeated a double freight of his right hand at the PS@@ V Eindhoven . &quot;
&quot; while this left the left @-@ le@@ stick to weeping and shut it out for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up hope that Sha@@ w can play again in this season . &quot;
the violation was caused by a retro@@ eless attack by H@@ é@@ ctor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old Sha@@ w was broken in the PS@@ V sector .
it was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before being hosp@@ itali@@ zed .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a double foot structure and lies in the hospital . &quot;
he will be re@@ located tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then co @-@ operates in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy , who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it has really hard and then fantastic , and then what happens . &quot;
he had a oxygen mask in the dressing cabin .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor if you have a double Fra@@ ktur , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope that he can re@@ play this season .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a red card and a har@@ rowing boat .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not pen@@ alised the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al susp@@ ects that the Italian refer@@ ee had er@@ red himself .
&quot; you can judge for yourself , if I say that a penalty and a red card was due . &quot;
it was a very serious attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et on Sha@@ ws account said , &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I was , my way to recovery starts now , I am coming back again . &quot;
referring to : Manchester United has the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at the PS@@ V
&quot; the England def@@ ender has an additional inc@@ entive in France for the European Championship in France , to be able to recover until the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Coc@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
&quot; it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate one opponent . &quot;
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg started when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ As Holland team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you hear that there is a very aw@@ ful injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Coc@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball , which was in another direction , so it looked like &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; , but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno said : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it could be . &quot;
I feel very po@@ or@@ ly there . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dado was also brought to hospital - after a l@@ oul@@ playing from Chris Sm@@ alling .
certainly David Cameron doesn &apos;t know the Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it &apos;s one thing to learn all parents soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it almost . &quot;
unless you are maybe David Cameron .
&quot; having asked by a supp@@ orter of child care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax decided to be Prime Minister of Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult election , Cameron speaking in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children , because it seems to have a picture or a message we have missed . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is supposedly describing the plot of the book , instead conceived a contents of the 2012 film version , added to the new characters and details to expand the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the am@@ id@@ st of the Tor@@ te @-@ Ville , where all the nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , claimed to see her desire to see a real tree , he reads . a love of love was Dr. Se@@ uss , whose real name Theodor Se@@ uss Geis@@ el was loud and which passed away in 1991 , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if that was not susp@@ ici@@ ously enough , the text reads like the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which will be presented on the website of the Internet Movie Database , and so begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named Ted , hopes to win the heart of Au@@ drey , the girls of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; even though he would like to be a prag@@ matic father , it seems that Cameron doesn &apos;t know the action of the book so little . here a un@@ named boy hears , like the local environment through the gel@@ ation , trees for@@ l@@ ling , th@@ og@@ gling , and &quot; that speaks in the name of the trees , &quot; he becomes ra@@ v@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a helper that the Lor@@ ax hasn &apos;t read 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Do@@ wning Street spokesperson said that the text might probably have been replaced by Cam@@ er@@ ons &apos;s election office .
&quot; Super camps confirmed that the text was delivered by Cam@@ er@@ ons , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened with the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; in Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates , is a difficult task , but when you selected the Ka@@ der who has chosen England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series isn &apos;t on my map . &quot;
I would not end a reverse victory .
&quot; Al@@ ast@@ air C@@ ooks Site may be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the joint spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear a sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; the ball is developed by Mo@@ een Ali as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and A@@ DI@@ L Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown size on testing level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
this specific message : Adam Ly@@ n ex@@ ts from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ ons , of course , is , of course , being difficult to analyse as his master trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and simple , but hard reality is that crime players are targeted on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nomin@@ ation , since - and I said this to their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago one could have extended the barrel of Ly@@ ons , but he had control of his own dest@@ iny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully when he strikes out more rounds for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ coach Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his post@@ ure , even if he did not attain such good performance , and he doesn &apos;t surprised me ; he is especially a team man . &quot;
&quot; the question , how much time a test b@@ ats@@ man receives to put his character is difficult . &quot;
&quot; Ly@@ ons got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son in front of him , while Nick Com@@ pt@@ on was 9 . &quot;
just Com@@ pt@@ on got the chance to play home and way .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that I could rise was that England was first en@@ cap@@ sul@@ ated in the Caribbean - when ly@@ was in its peak , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a b@@ ats@@ man I highly per@@ severe . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s an X @-@ factor Cri@@ ck@@ et@@ player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he posted 236 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same chances as those in front of him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea , to kill Mo@@ een next to Cook , allowing a extra spin @-@ spin @-@ bow@@ ler and hit four ch@@ icks , and I didn &apos;t stop it . &quot;
I don &apos;t see why a b@@ ats@@ man can &apos;t beat there and that le@@ f@@ case has already shown that he is a v@@ icious sign of cri@@ cket @-@ players .
&quot; perhaps he didn &apos;t do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for them , and there is no difference . &quot;
&quot; my early team @-@ mate Justin Lang@@ er played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he appeared as open@@ er in 2001 . &quot;
he immediately abolished three hundred with us and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Abdul@@ ari enters the Ka@@ der as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited dealing with him he has impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may possibly see his statistics on average 31 with the ra@@ cket and 35 by the ball - and think , it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup agents that rise up their hands and the coach were chosen for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has taken a few smart supplements while exercising . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela Jay@@ awar@@ es , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; it is one of the nic@@ est not@@ ch of the game , which will bring a wealth of experience since he played under all conditions and attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood is coming to the white ball phase of the tour and brings power and into force in the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the dressing cabin , even if the messages are in line with what you said . &quot;
&quot; coll@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , won &apos;t be used in the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot was a similar break against Australia and I for my part have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team@@ pi@@ er do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you need to remember that just as they depend on the players their jobs .
such decisions are not taken in a light heart .

&quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside the EU at the inside of the EU - &quot; Let &apos;s not wish you alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and we can see that more and more short c@@ auti@@ ous ministers and officials have come up to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
Germany &apos;s c@@ auti@@ ous ch@@ anc@@ ellor Angela Merkel is a pair but she has been in power for 10 years before it looks po@@ or@@ ly for her as it was done for exagger@@ ating like Th@@ at@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande looks back on its re @-@ election or its replacement in 2017 .
he is also a bl@@ ending strength .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine that they become a leg spread out in order to prevent the Sel@@ f@@ ie Br@@ its from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want to use the UK - something they don &apos;t want it because most similar separat@@ ist ten@@ dencies have to be put .
&quot; as a result , perhaps some such ministers are deliberately not deliberately un@@ helpful notes , in SN@@ P style , while British referendum in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ xit process , you susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the re @-@ trial was a Ple@@ ite &quot; and &quot; Great Britain has won no value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
the Europeans know how popular the Fle@@ et Street can be on their own costs and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Press bar@@ one but it did not like it during the course of Tony Ben@@ n who supported our entrance in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 .
&quot; they may remember weak to Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro @-@ opportun@@ ists who made themselves a name as a &quot; &quot; EU Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; &quot; correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his fail@@ ures , Ed Mili@@ band knew who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ für@@ st@@ ating @-@ Sch@@ ur@@ ks , Telephone @-@ h@@ acking ali@@ ens and P@@ seu@@ do Non @-@ In@@ side , who possess most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bl@@ air was feeling similar about them , but noted that when you sit down with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , one better ban@@ anas , in order to di@@ stra@@ ct him instead of his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band played more Bl@@ ai@@ as as Bl@@ air himself as he resi@@ sted to Cam@@ er@@ ons during regular speaker , as Bl@@ air had rejected the principle of the non @-@ approved constitution of the EU , which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 . &quot;
the press never did it up .
&quot; but the nice Jeremy Cor@@ by@@ n who gave me a friendly cl@@ aps on the back on Monday - I told him that he had no time to repeat for me - seems to be repeated in danger , Neil Kin@@ no@@ cks Bo@@ yk@@ ott Mur@@ doch . &quot;
&quot; it may last but he must develop a co@@ her@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Marshall , whose BBC @-@ sofa has left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position to Europe - I just press it out - in the development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional bl@@ ends and wild Ge@@ ography of Tor@@ ys Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can indeed say yes . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on radio and television this week stated that Cor@@ by &apos;s ren@@ aming of prov@@ oked John Mc@@ Donn@@ ell as Sch@@ att@@ enk@@ anz@@ ler had a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; he remin@@ ded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father engaged in television to be loyal to his Labour Cab@@ inet meeting , without going far too far and to lose his Cab@@ inet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to stay &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - Benn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said , even what J@@ C told his mates and MPs after all reports on Monday evening . &quot;
what always wants to express the stir@@ rer Bot@@ tom @-@ Up Image of Cor@@ by@@ n - remember that He even has touched me - News discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and especially in the stru@@ del of the Social Media , a breeding of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right , Cameron doesn &apos;t give a card for Europe that allows him to keep Lab@@ ours support in refer@@ end@@ ums to a matter how Mc@@ Donn@@ ell said it . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks of that .
&quot; but Mc@@ Donn@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns essential proposals for EU membership - in line with its Benn@@ ite @-@ planes @-@ economy , their anti @-@ capitalist history - is no longer a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dis@@ sidents , for which the Nar@@ z@@ is@@ sm@@ us of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disp@@ utes . &quot;
&quot; as with its in@@ am@@ big@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Watson , that J@@ C is not committed to the outlet , becoming foreign diplom@@ ats to try to find , in particular , to find a sense for their su@@ peri@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin turn to political capital - they also have mis@@ interpreted elec@@ torate - to make conc@@ essions to the British if all of these can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the United States are already rather disappointed of the weak military service in Iraq , in Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction in the T@@ ory government , which I was inspired by the start on Monday that was called the British Influ@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise the Public Health England report about e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; claims of a state financed agency that cigarettes are less harmful than smoking from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts , who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , joined the Lanc@@ et by critic@@ ise the media use by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have placed the lo@@ ad@@ ability of the data and directed between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
a leading article in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month took the &quot; extremely win@@ dy foundation &quot; on the P@@ he established his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims made &quot; on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , professor of European public@@ ity Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public expects that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes are around 95 % less harmful than smoking at a detailed review of evidence and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for a multi @-@ critical criteria ( multi @-@ Crit@@ eria Dec@@ ision Analysis - M@@ CD@@ A ) in order to bring their opinions about the damage of various nic@@ ot@@ ine solutions to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summar@@ ized in a research report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting is a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health who has been managing director of British American Tob@@ acco ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study .
&quot; he also signed the references of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received from the tobacco company Philip Morris International to reports from the tobacco company and Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for the selection of the members of the board are not supplied , but this includes several well @-@ known E @-@ cigarettes champion , some of which also specify a sector funding in paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in the tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco ladder of P@@ he also attended . &quot;
the Group &apos;s research work is stri@@ ving that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products in most criteria , &quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well wrote . &quot;
&quot; however , no restrictions or limitations are discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims by P@@ he said that &quot; there are no evidence so far that e @-@ cigarettes as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smoking . &quot;
&quot; pro@@ f Kevin F@@ enton , director of health and well @-@ being at P@@ he said that according to the statements made by BM@@ J , he had previously re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life smo@@ ker dies at his ad@@ diction .
&quot; all the evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigarettes in comparison are low , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the clear duty to the information of the public about what evidence proves , and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80,000 people die yearly in a disease with regards to smoking , and smoking costs the National health system for two billion £ every year . &quot;
&quot; by means of clear evidence of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of damage caused by smoking is fulfilling our national authority . &quot;
&quot; BBC should leave East@@ En@@ ders , former leader of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop to send programs like East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial rival &quot; would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows such as Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the radio charge would only be used to do the kind of programs , which are not broadcast by other UK broad@@ caster . &quot;
&quot; the BBC critic@@ ised the BBC that they will be publicly @-@ rated programmes that will probably be seen from a smaller audience , in hard @-@ controversial time window , against the most popular shows of their rival and Sen@@ so@@ res like BB@@ C4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC CEO , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that he tried for six years in his time at Channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs would be on behalf or send them , which are also clearly stated by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed rival , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus @-@ Communications Committee under his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you wish to keep the radio charge , which I hold medium or long @-@ term stays in the long @-@ term , one should give his production at least on programs that do not do or order . &quot;
they send The Voice into a first @-@ class window because they want to achieve a broad support for their future .
&quot; the idea that nobody would show it is a joke , it &apos;s ridic@@ ulous , of course it is non@@ sense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is financed even without subsidi@@ zation .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own production . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ estly , other channels would give their right arm to this . &quot;
I stri@@ ve to see how this should be public @-@ legal television .
I don &apos;t think this would actually decrease the BBC .
&quot; Johnson , a business entrepren@@ eur for the series , led to the Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC &apos;s inno@@ c@@ ence was &quot; &quot; because of the amb@@ itions of people who work there and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC will give back what is the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ meeting lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows how East@@ end should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs can go to BB@@ C4 , but they can &apos;t talk to their tasks , and they can argue that when they are based on their seem@@ ingly sacred missions to a just@@ ification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all those ob@@ sc@@ ure programs which nobody has seen . &quot;
they lay them in a window in which nobody ever wanted to see .
&quot; for the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the Committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ aining system in terms of conditions that can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that one receives a great value for £ 150 per year , but for people who for the 150 £ a lot of money I wonder if that &apos;s right , because it doesn &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - and channel 5 leader David El@@ stein , who also said before the committee on Tuesday , requested that the BBC should review their &quot; &quot; Rei@@ th@@ ian mission &quot; &quot; to provide and talk . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little von der BBC production would have been officially classified as education , he said that it is 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % in the radio - and they should have to change this in public publicly related television channels in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas such as the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a hand@@ ful of television are shown and with the commercial sensitivity alli@@ ances meet to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ ogen@@ etics &apos; can ste@@ er brain cell by waves
the video shows how the Nem@@ ato@@ des will change the direction at the moment in which they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound imp@@ ul@@ ses .
researchers have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by fra@@ cture of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny Nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment , in which they have exc@@ essively high frequencies , to be heard for the human hearing , to be heard . &quot;
imp@@ ul@@ ses work through the inser@@ tion of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on @-@ cells that are genetically modified to wear the membrane channels , react on ultr@@ asound waves . &quot;
one more about this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said that worms showed the power of a new trial , called Son@@ ogen@@ etics , to activate a number of bra@@ ins , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ć@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of a day could replace the depths of brain stim@@ ulation , an inv@@ asive procedure which gives electric pul@@ ses into the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; se@@ clu@@ sion is usually not respond to ultr@@ asound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani pointed out that they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ opic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , he found out , strengthen the ultr@@ asound waves , that enter into worms . &quot;
&quot; ultr@@ asonic waves function on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ I@@ on@@ en@@ kan@@ ers and are found in membran@@ es of some of the dice cells . &quot;
&quot; the waves have the opening of this ion channels and activate the cells , which they are assigned , such a journal Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultr@@ asound controlled Nem@@ ato@@ des , genetically modified Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms that some of its mot@@ ions TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels can carry . &quot;
&quot; when an ultr@@ asound is applied on the changed circles , the waves are reinforced by the micro bub@@ bles and transferred into the worms , where they are changing the changed Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ ar@@ ities with op@@ to@@ gen@@ etics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to im@@ pose or eliminate neur@@ ons with stimul@@ us of light . &quot;
&quot; however , Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ ogen@@ us could have some advantages over this technique . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired heart in the brain , low frequency @-@ ultr@@ asound ultr@@ asound fabric can be imp@@ aired and can be sent to the brain from top on the skull . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we believe that with satisfaction and a therapeutic virus , it is possible to temporarily ant@@ alize the targeted human ne@@ ural cre@@ atively for the ultr@@ asound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , added . &quot;

eight golden rules for life in student residence
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student residence in a student residence in a student residence in a student residence , but only now I remember the att@@ acking smile of those who have sc@@ and@@ alized - and to the numerous , long@@ ha@@ dy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be dist@@ illed in eight simple rules .
&quot; the entrance to student residence goes from slightly annoying , up to absolutely terri@@ fying . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to smile : people tell whence you come from where and where you have taken the Sabbath year , where you have done in terms of corn and why you say &quot; &quot; hon@@ estly Mar@@ m@@ ite does not love to hate , because it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ haha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it gives conversation and helps you to find out people , which you may not speak in contrast to those with which you wouldn &apos;t talk , even if your l@@ ashes were in fire and this fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people leave humans .
&quot; people often turn into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venues and communal meeting points , but they are also the places where people dress and their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not think about working at the university with a relationship
Intro@@ duc@@ ted receives a gross treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student halls form a room @-@ to @-@ room bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that can be kind and soci@@ ally and lead to li@@ fel@@ ong friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who is trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in the culture allows you to say : &quot; I love you , and I want our friendship , but you must go away so that I get back the energy that I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a comp@@ utation of soci@@ ability is exhausted - and send SMS to an SMS instead .
apro@@ pos vo@@ icing : do it .
a guy in my student houses had the not@@ ion that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by che@@ ek .
&quot; as you begin the Uni at the height of the back @-@ mania , the clo@@ ister along the doors of people in order to introduce yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less strange than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome in the neighborhood , I have something ble@@ ached to you . so , and now please smile , when I ask you a couple of personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats : a good way to close friend@@ ships .
&quot; their ro@@ omm@@ ates are committed to enter@@ tain themselves , and will perhaps associate the face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
of course this depends on whether you are a decent bakery .
&quot; po@@ or@@ ly missed c@@ lot from flour , sugar and fat , make people sleeping , when you stand . &quot;
&quot; steal food is an dependent crime in student residence . &quot;
&quot; of course , the cl@@ aws of chicken is an theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check it out with the owner &apos;s owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say , self @-@ service yourself , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if anyone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to move balanced more than my fellow @-@ inhabitants who added a washing up to her milk to pun@@ ish th@@ ie@@ ves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they shouldn &apos;t make noise , which keeps people from sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not just about being a permanent human being , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of pro@@ ver@@ ts , sitting in the glass ash@@ aus . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my corridor asked her neighbors , whether it makes them slightly qui@@ eter , drum &amp; bass slightly qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and it had an exam in the morning . &quot;
they acted on it with still loud music .
&quot; when they finally heard about 5 o &apos;clock , her neighbours came to sleep for two hours before leaving her own music , shut down her door , and went on to her three hour examination . &quot;
&quot; wouldn &apos;t it be romantic , if your future sp@@ ouse would random@@ ly enter into the same student residence again ? &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , it would not be quite intenti@@ onal ; if you have a resident for your future co @-@ partner , they have to separate themselves , and then they &apos;ll have to see each day and experience how they bring together all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart inev@@ it@@ ably goes his own ways - but if a hot co @-@ owner is definitely not your future married partner , try at least to talk a little reason . &quot;
&quot; at the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has lost his key in his un@@ sealed room , the border between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ b@@ bing happens when it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good route is fun , but it takes only moments until he becomes the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
immer@@ se yourself by plug@@ ging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but do never su@@ stain any of our rooms with tooth@@ paste and shampoo .
&quot; shut off your door , and place your keys into a glass of water , which you then put into the freezer - but do not fli@@ ck@@ ering your possessions from the ceiling as twice as fast . &quot;

&quot; for instance , for refugees - but also as signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living space , but also the on@@ attra@@ cting mother and the pupp@@ ets alone . &quot;
&quot; I show how to build and build well today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for home market .
entrepren@@ eur Mark Gil@@ dner to know how swi@@ ft@@ ly cheaper housing can be created : it builds inside a project terra@@ ced houses for refugees .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees are pushing for the home market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the total accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
because people stay in a great part here .
&quot; in view of the refugee flow , we need a living room in the coming decades . &quot;
a very small and three @-@ storey detached house is the solution .
Gil@@ dner : a fe@@ eb@@ row needs the least space .
it facil@@ it@@ ates integration .
that &apos;s different if one under@@ scores the people in residential blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three residential units for four asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; each residential unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can easily be converted to each particular needs . &quot;
how high are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 184 000 Euro , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ age@@ able .
the construction was taken six months .
that is reasonable .
do the building regulations have its plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have entered my project correctly .
it always makes the dro@@ oping Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ worth special construction and the slot machine .
gr@@ assy .
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordin@@ ated who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities the place is missing .
and refugees and asylum seek@@ ers have no cars .
how did the people react to their terra@@ ced house projects ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who have accused me of creating luxury built for asylum seek@@ ers .
what definitely is not right .
but don &apos;t you tigh@@ ten the compet@@ itor &apos;s resi@@ due for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the last five years we had a building boom in Germany in the last five years , but only a luxury apartments that could hardly be able to afford . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living room . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the on@@ ie@@ ve@@ able mother or of the Ger@@ ing@@ ol@@ aters . &quot;
let &apos;s show how you can build and build well today .
that is why it goes .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by clicking to &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; to select &quot; General , &quot; and then &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it is prepared , you can download the phone to download and install . &quot;
&quot; after installation , some have encountered difficulties since they get an error message that is mis@@ leading the &quot; software update &quot; is missing . &quot;
&quot; to handle the problem , users are recommended to wait either until the ons@@ lau@@ ght return or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;

&quot; one of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old communist , followed by police two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to be waiting for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
&quot; on the premises of the petrol station , there were also three persons . &quot;
one of these men now cried to the young people and hit this face with her fist .
the victim suffered a nose and ha@@ em@@ or@@ rh@@ age strongly from the nose .

&quot; the perpet@@ r@@ ator followed the group with passenger cars up to the apartment , and demonstr@@ atively several times over there . &quot;
&quot; when you didn &apos;t see the car anymore , the last one before the building was to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was again attacked by the ra@@ cket and another male person .
&quot; using a striking , one checked the victim &apos;s face and the upper th@@ igh@@ s of the victim . &quot;
the last had to be put in a hospital .

&quot; in many places around the country doctors - As@@ endorf are absent , fortunately , Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ sh@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; during the reason of Ur@@ sel Fel@@ icia , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing for his successor in the coming months still another half way to the page . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller will open the practice on 12 October until then he invested 3@@ 10,000 euros to the location at the St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; sympathy was at first sight when the Fel@@ ar@@ aus@@ ens had met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently completing her medical training at the hospital and will also get into practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the tr@@ ash would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ sh@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was ready , I just called it . &quot;
&quot; as a couple of years , the idea introduced her own practice in As@@ endorf . &quot;
&quot; the near@@ ness and the permanent contact to the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to meet , and accompany the families of the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also see his own boss . &quot;
and so you agree that the garbage bags bought this house with practice .
they will continue to stay in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; there is the two @-@ fold family father Frank Müller , also raised in several doctor &apos;s medical practices and hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ ch@@ â@@ tel . &quot;

&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultr@@ asound tests as well as long @-@ term and loading @-@ ups and need an office room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of 50,000 Euros for the garbage collection will receive a grant from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proudly and glad we are , that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ izes Sam@@ t@@ ally &apos;s citizenship , Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients come to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l each quarter into practice , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in As@@ endorf there is another veter@@ inary practice .
&quot; a positive side effect through Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains in As@@ ales , according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ icity breaks . &quot;
&quot; if no successor could have found , she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who is attending the litter @-@ hour , at the way , still look in trusted faces : take over the seven medical experts and the cleans@@ er from the rock rise . &quot;
&quot; the part@@ ing ended in as@@ endorf a era , and at least , the physician practic@@ ed for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel rim breaks open . &quot;
&quot; after the long time , we feel a little wor@@ m@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; but we continued to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients continue to see them often , &quot; says the prin@@ cess . &quot;
&quot; your husband compl@@ ements , &quot; We have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;

Croatia : &quot; let &apos;s leave refugees &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also mar@@ ched at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of Interior Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remains in parallel .
&quot; it is clear that everyone who wants to make an asylum application , of course . &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the people &apos;s supply and safety are in the fore@@ ground .
&quot; but it is clear , however , that it needs significant signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people have to know that we don &apos;t accept infinite migration flows , nor via the Austr@@ o @-@ Slovenian border . &quot;
it takes a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government has previously reported that Slovenia would continue to continue arriving in Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and can also build cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees . &quot;
quite so I did not see the Minister of Interior Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach however .
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors may be &quot; absolutely un@@ acceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather be the monitoring of the border - especially to Hungary - intensi@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia is , however , already controlled by the position of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister emphas@@ ised , Sloven@@ ians wants to rein@@ force its borders for refugees but not . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must fill its comm@@ itments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government pointed out , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to travel to the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d in order to avoid the registration of the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police allow them to grow in the nearby maize fields .
&quot; according to local media , numerous new refugees have ever met in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; the mass set mainly for Syrians and Afghanistan , including numerous women and children . &quot;
&quot; rescue service , and the Red Cross are already in use . &quot;
&quot; over the next days , his country with around 4000 refugees , &quot; Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic said . &quot;
&quot; moreover , buses from Pre@@ se@@ vo to the Maced@@ onian Serb border , which had previously carried migrants to the Hungarian border , agreed to Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Belgrade , the government in Belgrade susp@@ ects that it might be a person to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it called it . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , in any case , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of Si@@ d during the morning , further buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were traveling the entire night of the Maced@@ onian border through Serbia around 500 kilometres distant . &quot;
&quot; we have heard that Hungary has au@@ d@@ ited , so the police told us that we should drive here , &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it could actually be prec@@ eded by ob@@ serving the previous Balkan Route @-@ Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary to a slightly further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously noted that his country prepared the case of a strong states of refugees proposed by refugees for possible exceptional situation .
he did not name details but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
hold strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners in the country have passed through a good witness since the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on this Serbian border , some 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports they reported last night at the border crossing Hor@@ g@@ os , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing hor@@ g@@ os and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees continue to continue on the Croatian border still un@@ clear .
&quot; Serbian Minister for Serbian Minister Neb@@ o@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ anovic was on Wednesday early at a local eye bar in Hor@@ g@@ os : he kept the debates about Altern@@ ativ@@ es@@ ere refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , is past . &quot;
there are currently not very high refugee numbers .
&quot; could not say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia , or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers on migrants : dangerous - Alternative energies
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters already started to distribute maps to the refugees where alternative routes are drawn by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not harmless : in parts of the border , 20 years after the end of the conflict there is still not more spacious min@@ ef@@ ields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of min@@ ef@@ ields was sent in the border region . &quot;

F@@ ed@@ Ex is mixed , finance outlook for 2016 cut &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter and the singer @-@ gig@@ ant accounted for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo and higher costs in cargo transportation services .
&quot; the company also said that she plans to hire approximately 5@@ 5.000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set up 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. Announ@@ ces a prize of $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in the next May , 20 cents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts are expected to be out of a survey of € 10,@@ 84 . &quot;
&quot; the lower view is effective despite the price increases , which are 4.9 percent , and will be effective on January 4 and despite increased supplements for bo@@ ating heavy and large pack@@ ets , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it is nevertheless expected to increase the result over the previous year due to cost reduction , revenues , and growth for growth in online stores . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company provides &quot; solid income , &quot; when you consider the weaker economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday employment has been announced one day later than that of the rival UPS , which plans to hire 9@@ 0.000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workforce , about the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;

&quot; over the last few years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has shown a decline in international pri@@ ce@@ ability shipping to stag@@ n@@ ate sales in his unit in Express Shipping . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; sales dropped by 29 percent during the last quarter , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs and self @-@ insurance costs . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher income due to higher prices , while the result was higher operating costs due to higher employment costs . &quot;
&quot; in the Pre@@ market trade , about one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares increased by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0,@@ 15 . &quot;

&quot; and this third mandate , the X @-@ factor might be in a decision to predic@@ t it predic@@ t . it will be announced on Thursday if the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the near to zero @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most data of the economy show that they are solid , the latest turbul@@ ence in the global financial markets may make the anticip@@ ation of interest in global financial markets , increasing this vol@@ atility of interest in bonds , and it is also just one quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in the first line will be the most important thing she observed , &quot; &quot; Lind@@ sey M. Pie@@ g@@ za , Head of the Mak@@ i &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text that were not going to increase the interest rate , increased un@@ certainty around the global market is enough just@@ ification to wait . &quot;
&quot; there is no con@@ sensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which ev@@ ates itself the financial market . &quot;
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists who have recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted an interest rate of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; the financial markets , however , anticip@@ ate a wait to see the F@@ ed , with a key indic@@ ative that only shows a 30 % chance to increase his increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decrease in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strateg@@ ists fall off the strike by promise that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial Average score by 2@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was fired by expectations so that the F@@ ed policy maintained the sentence in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , Chief economist at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if it does , it would have to go very far in their declaration to calm the financial markets , so that they are not in panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts argu@@ ed that a interest rate would calm down the financial markets , because they make the un@@ certainty of when the F@@ ed would act . &quot;
&quot; another month ago , the F@@ ed seemed to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in the spring and early summer , Y@@ ellen had said that in this year despite the compl@@ aining of the settlement of Liber@@ als that more economic progress would be required to increase the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of employment in August slow@@ ed , the improvement in the job market would be solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest since more than seven years and close to levels , which sees the F@@ ed as full work . &quot;
wage subsidies have shown signs of a recovery .
&quot; although inflation was steadily decl@@ ining about 2 % of the Central Bank &apos;s annual target , the main reason said that the main reason for the temporary effect of much lower oil prices was . &quot;
&quot; the economy can overcome higher interest rates and needs them due to the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian She@@ pher@@ dson , Chief economist at Pan@@ the@@ on Macro@@ pru@@ . &quot;
&quot; but the financial markets were together all over the world at the end of the last month , after China had appreciated its currency . &quot;
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial Average score dropped more than 16 % below its peak , when investors feared that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would boost global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market is re@@ covering in this month , where the Dow is now around 10 % below the blast from May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed Representative , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and news on the weakness of Chinese economy would not appear in the past few weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low on U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and former staff of the U.S. emergency database . &quot;
&quot; now he predic@@ t that they will be waiting for at least one month to get the effects better in the grip . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of in@@ security beyond that which will be the impact on the US economy , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; O@@ liner said . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is none of the main concern the F@@ ed , therefore , it should not be included in its decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority has become the world .
the impact of the central bank was enormous during the last few years .
&quot; the mere notice of the then lead Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could close their monetary expansion &quot; , &quot; dis@@ b@@ anded the confusion about the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , they can monitor from the F@@ ed representatives that they will not only monitor the developments in other places but also with other central banks and experts advise to obtain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of the Global Strategy for the asset management of the Company En@@ vest@@ iture Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed had a story of inter@@ actions on financial market movements , which seem to seem to be linked with the economic fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , the voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , called for an interest @-@ rate hike , quoted decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to cut its lead by 0,@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited notable effects on growth in the US , &quot; L@@ acker said . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed represent@@ ant moved these cuts .
&quot; F@@ ed should set aspects of financial stability only during a serious crisis as the market collapsed in 2008 , Adam S. Poz@@ nan was a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ence are not in the vicinity of this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is fear@@ ful of interest for interest , &quot; &quot; Poz@@ nan , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not think that it will require the time . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small help for refugees
more and more refugees arrive in Germany this day .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , not without the dedication of the volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da , there are a range of people who support non @-@ profit asylum seek@@ ers in the city . &quot;
to them belong to Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher and soul teacher .
she also teaches with her 74 L@@ ences as well .
every Thursday they &apos;re doing in the asylum seek@@ ers at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there , it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is the very other teaching than at a right school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s p@@ ä@@ di@@ at@@ ric society Rio Grande funds health nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian sy@@ at@@ ric organization SP@@ RS tries to educ@@ ate women about how important nutrition while feeding is . she is doing this with the presentation of images of babies , which are painted on breasts , with represent@@ ations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of protein , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates , which give babies every level of nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research findings suggest that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary adaptation that should make the mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet representing pregnant women really affects the genes of their babies and protecting them from the development of tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can affect the immune system neg@@ atively . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ ina sports hall
the Municipal Council of Bern@@ ar@@ lo@@ in approved the building application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar system .
the plan for the long @-@ long @-@ se@@ eded hall@@ ways at the Bern@@ ina sports facility comes step by step : the most recent construction work has been abolished in the most recent construction work without great discussions .
&quot; before that , the board also had an application for the statutory &quot; &quot; respec@@ tive &quot; liberation &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception &quot; , we went permission for a special form in terms of the roof structure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a semi @-@ semi @-@ semi @-@ semi @-@ covered first and roof should be erected . &quot;
&quot; in the background of planning is the designated use of roof space for solar plants : &quot; &quot; thus we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; &quot; declared Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Liberation &quot; again increased the roof , which is prescribed for energy reasons - differently than in the development plan , and should lie below ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is significantly reduced .
&quot; a &quot; Liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan for the roof was not &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ ina is usually restri@@ ctive to the liberation of liberation rather than restri@@ ctive . &quot;
&quot; it is not a recur@@ ring project regarding the gym : &quot; &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent &quot; , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym hall on sports centre is a joint project of the municipality and S@@ V Bern@@ ar@@ ried .
&quot; at costs , approximately 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
grants are expected from school and lat@@ itude promotion .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meter hall will be submitted to the area of the Coun@@ cill@@ or for its review . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital should be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed the Medical Director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of staff members move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this is seen by the surprising plans of the hospital , the administrative district of Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on board the Supervisory Board , and the next Wednesday , September 23 . &quot;
if the plans were to be implemented then all of the nearly 50 associates will continue working at the hospital at P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg .
the vast majority should be exchanged with fishermen and the further inland station to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are present .
&quot; the employees who can &apos;t go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a job in W@@ eil@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; triggered by Dr Andreas E@@ der , who has been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital for the beginning of the year , and now changes to a private practice near the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question , who is to succeed one , came to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , whose name &quot; Fischer &quot; came in at the game , who was willing to take over the direction from 1 October and to change his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au this means an &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of supply in the field of Internal Medicine &apos; and so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White .
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) speci@@ alizes in the inner station on gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; only for the next two years , fishermen with his team , if the board of directors are sure to lead the two houses , until then next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ies , which has to be completed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years will definitely be closed . &quot;
&quot; so far , the county has planned this in 2018 , if the current reconstruction is concluded at the W@@ eil@@ heim hospital . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White , who is also the Chairman of the Supervisory Board , assumed rum@@ ors that the House , which is owned by the Federal State Court , will soon be used as accommodation for asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this close me . as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White couldn &apos;t say that there are several consider@@ ations . &quot;
there are currently a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sych@@ iat@@ ric .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; says Fischer on the Qu@@ asi dispute to the Le@@ ch , which has been positive and very understand@@ able . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where fishermen has worked for over 30 years , has not been given . &quot;
he has been asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the post of the Medical Director .
&quot; the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened by closure in the past decades . departments have been closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hands of the Rhein @-@ Neckar lion &apos;s gloves are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 a.m. ) in the Berg@@ ischer HC .
&quot; in Wuppertal , the major league in the Bundesliga is one of the clear favour@@ ites , and there is none . &quot;
&quot; during the last season , the Bad@@ ener during the B@@ HC have a painful defeat and have a little bit of cleaning . &quot;
hunting fall with two injured Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest by shots .
&quot; during the super@@ st@@ ition at a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( Landkreis Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use , like the police . &quot;
&quot; after a set@@ ail , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man had suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; as it could happen to the accident , initially was un@@ clear . &quot;
the crime police identified .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a susp@@ ects has led the police to a body which had been recorded since Saturday 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate .
&quot; in the inter@@ rog@@ ation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old tried to have killed the young people and put their body into a canal in rock@@ ets . &quot;
one of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhineland @-@ Palat@@ inate is a victim of violent crimes .
&quot; the body of young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen in Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosecutor and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; a vig@@ orous , also held on Tuesday night , is said to be a 20 @-@ year @-@ old who , in fact , to indicate the indication and investig@@ ators to the discovery of the body . &quot;
&quot; the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was missing on Sunday morning , after having arrived home on Sunday after a visit for a autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
in search of young women the investig@@ ators wanted to keep on personal bel@@ ong@@ ings of the victim .
&quot; at surveys in the Association of friends and acquain@@ t@@ ances , there came up a tat@@ too against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the suspected perpet@@ rators brought the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the body was found . &quot;
&quot; the alleged arrest , according to the authorities , killed the 16 @-@ year @-@ old police and laid the body in the canal . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be demonstrated on Wednesday the harbour . investig@@ ators put him a grave .
in reality the further investigation should be carried out .
refugees need accommodations : study warns of housing
the situation in the German residential property market is an@@ cho@@ red .
and more refugees seek a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market grows .
the social housing is faced with a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long been underway .
&quot; with the upcoming refugees and asylum seek@@ ers from the EU more people push for a market , which is over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with a revenue of citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to cover the demand for affordable housing , 400,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; in this result , a study performed on behalf of the ally of social housing . &quot;
&quot; by way of comparison : 260@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees no longer required to live as asylum seek@@ ers in an initial public accommodation . &quot;
many walk to the housing market and lined up in long qu@@ eu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to Statist@@ ical Federal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seek@@ ers were available for rent in the last year . &quot;
but the negative development of the property market is not only in the increasing number of refugees .
the study also makes substantial gains in housing policy of the past years .
Germany Sli@@ be a residential mail@@ box to get bigger from year to year .
&quot; to date , around 77@@ ,000 housing units are already lacking in the ball@@ room areas , known as Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
&quot; therefore , many are working in large cities in WG rooms . &quot;
young adults stayed un@@ dom@@ ic@@ ably longer in the &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; on the housing market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per capita has dropped again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the alliance of &quot; social housing &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
yet new inc@@ enti@@ ves are to boost the social housing estate .
the tax @-@ value tax could be om@@ itted and the basic tax for funded apartments could be suspended .
&quot; according to alliance , attractive tax credits are needed . &quot;
the programme for refugee shel@@ ters of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well in cities and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , the Monday evening with 184 million euros was already more than half of the available amount for some 300 million euros . &quot;
now the project might even be sc@@ aled .
refugees are free @-@ up : Croatia and Slovenia do a corridor
&quot; according to Hungary , there is practically no coming through , and more refugees choose the way across Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing the transit of Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to have Slovenia over the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I talked to the Slov@@ ene Minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is situated between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen area .
the EU @-@ Country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; according to the estimate of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees collapsed in Croatia to get there from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RTL . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees in the day before .
&quot; new laws , which compet@@ ed on the same day in force , is virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to allow refugees to happen .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zoran Mil@@ anovic was declared : &quot; they can travel , and we are preparing for this opportunity . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who do not want to live in Croatia .
Croatian police attacked the first refugees in Serbia in the morning of Serbia at the border of Serbia in the morning .
&quot; most advanced media reports are reported from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
&quot; from both the bus and Tax@@ es , they came to the Serbian border town Si@@ d . &quot;
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they tried to get along the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , refugees sh@@ ines not in the border . &quot;
for this the thres@@ holds strip has other dangers : there are even sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
min@@ ef@@ ields will now quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after the closing of the border , there are barely more refugees according to the closing of the border . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police accounted for 3@@ 66 affected people . &quot;
just before the door of the Monday it was 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws sc@@ amps the over@@ coming and damage of the Grenz@@ z@@ a@@ uns as an off@@ ence .
&quot; therefore , 35 criminal proceedings were instit@@ uted in the Southern Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; sentences ranging up to five years , and the expul@@ sion from the country . &quot;
&quot; according to the Immig@@ ration Court , a total of 94 asylum seek@@ ers took place in the new &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sitting &quot; &quot; border on Tuesday , nearly all - 93 of them in the most important transition . &quot;
13 families with small children and two older people were among the applicants .
on Wednesday morning 40 refugees would have stopped .
&quot; practically , however , nobody has a view to be granted for asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seek@@ ers should be deported there .
&quot; in front of the &quot; transit port &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , only a few hundred refugees were gathered . &quot;
workers began to get up with it in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
they collected the tr@@ ash to leave the tens of thousands of people over the past few weeks in the road@@ side .
bar@@ row lat@@ ti@@ ces were dismant@@ led and one of the recording in the border area was rebuilt .
&quot; to the aim of this building , nobody wanted to express itself . &quot;
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary only few refugees arrive . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the country has intensi@@ fied its border controls . &quot;
&quot; but the 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , some 1400 people wait for the continuation of Germany . &quot;
the traffic from there to Germany was stopped in the morning on the German authorities .
&quot; in Freil@@ assing , some smaller groups of refugees met on foot . &quot;
may@@ ors : &quot; shr@@ inking &quot; on the border
&quot; we were busy after the bridge on Sunday with the evacu@@ ation , when suddenly ten people stood by travel agents at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor of Alois City . &quot;
tourists that were going to take the train to Pass@@ au .
&quot; but because Germany had dis@@ continued on Sunday because of the refugee flow with Austria , it was for them in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; says Stad@@ ler who immediately seized his assistance and the stran@@ ded with two other hel@@ pers and their cars crossed the border to the near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before that , we have first roasted the un@@ trusted guests , with lunch and beverages . &quot;
we just said we drive them by car to Pass@@ au .
&quot; that was , of course , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man would not take it to have a generous donation - 100 euro for the fire brig@@ ade .
&quot; that was very happy with us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; the increased train papers went on Sunday night in W@@ els from a train to Pass@@ au in a regional train to Pass@@ au , by the announcement that the railway traffic was dis@@ continued after Germany , but to try more than the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was shut down in the inn of W@@ ern@@ stein in the inn . &quot;
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border is generally high on track .
&quot; the bridge firmly linked to the Bavarian neighbours in Sunday , day before a two @-@ layer sp@@ orti@@ er - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending us another tens of thousands of thousands , is a logical result of seem@@ ingly sacred policy : &quot;
&quot; rather than in the R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke camp , at the beginning of the construction of structures to help human@@ ity , our Federal Chancellor formally established itself and publicly emphas@@ ized the attitude of the Hungarian authorities in the dark @-@ circle of National Socialism . &quot;
surro@@ unds of these policies are not only those Austri@@ ans who are confron@@ ted in the border areas with cha@@ otic conditions .
&quot; they must also recognize that the &quot; praised &quot; country , &quot; which they invited and welcomed , has nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; there will be a great challenge in view of the ongoing refugee flow and the nearby winter , where decent conditions for protection seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; and there will be another bigger - peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
Konrad in search of 35,000 winter districts
Konrad has filled all hands with the refugee flow .
Christian Konrad is it used to have its word weight .
the government has deployed the old Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Ban@@ ker in order to en@@ rol quarters for thousands of refugees .
&quot; in the wake of the publishing house Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , Konrad already has a grip on Konrad . &quot;
&quot; we do not have a homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he told his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great host , said Konrad and praised the organis@@ ational &quot; Master power . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the inner ministry , however , spoke of a &quot; k@@ ris@@ ky situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad with a demand of 8@@ 5,000 tran@@ se@@ ers in the he@@ ur@@ igen year reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35,000 accommodations must be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the Federation with 15.000 professionals . &quot;
&quot; if more refugees are being refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without soil , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
&quot; with the govern@@ ors , he already has interviews . &quot;
they would have assured him even for the refugees to make qu@@ arti@@ ere .
&quot; in Upper Austria , it works fine , &quot; said Ferry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ar is supported by Konrad .
tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born who will be resolved how the church will help .
great expectations of the request to be done in the ORF action &quot; Help as we do . &quot;
private individuals can offer un@@ complicated accommodation on the platform .
&quot; additionally , you are hoping for hotels in winter . &quot;
Konrad and Mai@@ er critic@@ ised the standards for the accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot;
in times it could not be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors must have a certain height of the Hand@@ held holder or the size of the th@@ igh@@ s .
for a temporary time &quot; emergency standards &quot; would apply .
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he was successful with his experience by Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gent@@ leman , which one does not say without another in the face . &quot;
power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er cause the republic to cause no cost as they declared themselves .
your employee numbers they want to increase it to three to four .
the own breeding @-@ search was not yet successful yet .
Konrad wanted to set a container at the st@@ eph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
just not until the opening of municipal sports and other buildings like tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for the placing of refugees is planning the city of Linz .
&quot; this is currently not necessary since the person concerned , without these measures , says Mayor Klaus Lug@@ er ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; other sites should be checked for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , for emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;

See@@ hofer : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian Prime Minister Horst See@@ hofer ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday expressed another approach in refugee database . &quot;
See@@ hofer gave me sures the German borders don &apos;t be sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic is also possible .
&quot; however , there are the relevant border controls . &quot;
these special trains with refugees to Germany will not give it any longer .
&quot; however , protection seek@@ ers would be brought to Germany with regular rolling stock . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger requested more reinforced solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that now Austria leads to inspec@@ tions on its borders , as well as for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger , a logical result from the prec@@ urs@@ ing of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general restoration of the &quot; New Ship@@ yard &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrial Line is officially completed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and office buildings , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is listed , the rest ( 2700 square metres ) is supposed to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology range . &quot;
&quot; in IT , the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Lower House . &quot;
he could imagine investing in the start@@ up companies of the new ship@@ yard and later also of ac@@ qui@@ res .
&quot; from the start , S &amp; T will cooperate with the new neighbours - a lot of which has been promising : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; € 1.7 million were invested in the location of S &amp; T in the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to a third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is t@@ apped from the Linz AG for 60 years to S &amp; T and Tech@@ .
30 per cent of the 2700 square meters of residual surface in the building are already rented , for a further 40 percent give it in@@ quiries . &quot;

&quot; this project had to push the 49 year old female from Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ad market : finally , it has now gained the form of another business loc@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la @-@ Shop in front of the company , in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothes of different manufacturers , turns everything to have ladies gloves of the brand Vene@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
bigger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop is in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I have looked at it for a long time , whether I want to open a shop , &quot; says Bre@@ it . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was , among other things , that even the Vene@@ la @-@ producers , which are at home in Bologna , from the idea of a personal site , where only her hand@@ bags were sold , were done . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Great Room for Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who own Italian roots . &quot;
it is your fashion interest in which she was placed in the cra@@ dle of her mother .
&quot; most of them , when something is developed and I can show new trends with good prices . &quot;
&quot; why such a woman when looking back a beautiful hand@@ bag in a tooth@@ ing , the specialist can not answer the last security . &quot;
&quot; this is , perhaps , that a beautiful bag is appreciated every out@@ fit . &quot;
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the P@@ fäl@@ zer@@ a ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place , whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders . &quot;
this feature also links with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US President .
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; if it is manifested in foreign policy , journalists will be manifested in the international crisis policy - the applicants for the US presidential office ra@@ ges the election campaign . &quot;
and cut off well .
this will also be registered in the Pf@@ al@@ z@@ ian K@@ all@@ stadt in which the grand@@ parents of the property billi@@ ard origin@@ ate .
the New York apartment with the gro@@ oming is a not@@ ion of many in the wine region on the Wine Route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ place is related to -@@ zig corners with him .
his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the town of Simone Wen@@ del turns a film about the ump .
&quot; and what are the vill@@ agers about his goal , the most powerful man in the world ? &quot;
&quot; I think these are somehow exciting , but in their K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ one species not so deeply impressed , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native city has directed an am@@ using documentary on the place and its famous castles , along with Tr@@ ump also counts the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes into word in Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) , so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; he didn &apos;t bring it to the king of the heart , &quot;
&quot; though , respect for the performance of the family , but also ten@@ ds to think that Tr@@ ump is already a bit of a big m@@ aul , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; co@@ h@@ ull@@ ly lau@@ ts the nickname , the K@@ all@@ town within a radius , &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; - to high @-@ German : the legisl@@ ature , says it . &quot;
the ump happens from the village of An@@ ders .
&quot; the Tr@@ ump &apos; success story began in 1885 , when the later grandfather immig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA . &quot;
corn@@ erst@@ one of the property company were first property shopping in New York .
&quot; but life of grand@@ parents was not free from tragedy : their wish to return to the homeland , fail at the Bavarian state in which the Palat@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not included Tr@@ ump , because he was once without hom@@ olog@@ ation , the Director of the Institute for Peace History and People &apos;s Dog , Roland Paul , was declared film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal out@@ mig@@ rant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the accompanying statements of the follow @-@ up statements .
he had repeatedly been talking about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border area to deter them .
&quot; as the pol@@ arity , it is not so lik@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a remote @-@ designed relative of Tr@@ um@@ ps ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the Op@@ a was a born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ eg@@ ro@@ wer in retirement she sees the Americans more dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so sin@@ tered . &quot;
believes he that Tr@@ ump comes from ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked at K@@ all@@ stadt , too . &quot;
the pension system Ver@@ on@@ ika Sch@@ ramm mentioned as many we@@ aves such as many K@@ all@@ st@@ ad@@ ter that a desc@@ endant from the Heinz family came to a visit for the church organ which was generally good .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald &apos;s Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they &apos;ll find it better if he does not win the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know whether it is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been on the age of his grandfather in the US , would have been like he , &quot; he wouldn &apos;t have arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting threads than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ ser Sarah Bü@@ hler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; then the grapes are un@@ ripe , without the president Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; W@@ end@@ els Film , who was recently interviewed for the Tr@@ ump , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ og@@ änger , and also in the USA the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot;

&quot; this dis@@ advantage of the resistance seemed to play an important role for Australian TV spectators , as Sun@@ rise aver@@ aged $ 39@@ ,000 in the five major cities , compared to Today 33@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Today a slight increase compared to the ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) , but its number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; as Today , Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ ,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;

the last three vote : Bachelor Samuel Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery un@@ revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah Mack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may seem un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly , who wins the Bachelor &apos;s bach@@ elor &apos;s . &quot;
the woman who finally landed in the Sam Wood in The Bachelor was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the main sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three left @-@ left girls will certainly not be pri@@ mer whether they are the one who has received the last Rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah Mack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows down the day before starting out of three , you possibly accid@@ entally put an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood uphol@@ ds his lips with the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women left out ly@@ rical manner , why Wood is the perfect man and called his meaning for humor , amb@@ ition , family values , and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked , &quot; If not you , who should receive the last Rose ? &quot; you might get answers to play , who won the heart of the bach@@ elor &apos;s heart . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki have both moved fast - except himself - Mack@@ ay as the best partner in Wood .
Sarah Mack@@ ay and Sam Wood had had a simple relationship with each other from the first day .
&quot; from the moment when I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies , I felt that they were quite compatible , and I thought that during the whole course of the show &quot; &quot; said Je@@ anne &apos;s Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands at his feet on Earth , it is so much fun to be with her , &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
I saw her together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable together .
Sarah Mack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood would be well suited as a couple .
&quot; from their view , Mack@@ ay said that the last week of the house made it clear that Wood &quot; could be &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m waiting for him now , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was en@@ ig@@ matic . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the left dam@@ sel alike - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor &apos;s game is on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
&quot; in Detroit and Seattle , they showed great interest after moving into the USA - and there were many other teams , who sent in@@ quiries to his impressive training day at the end of last year . &quot;
but Hay@@ nes chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a smart decision .
&quot; some train@@ ee had banned Hay@@ dn for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a comm@@ ot@@ he , as did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Rug@@ by League , in his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ nes the next opportunity to a point @-@ return , and also in the current game after an injury by Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula continued to present his true face in the changing cabin after the game .
&quot; instead of his ro@@ ok@@ ies ahead of the rest of the team , he encouraged it . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened himself publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Sport@@ s- Cam , In@@ man reported that Hay@@ nes was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ G@@ aug@@ he@@ y who advised him to immediately forget his pat@@ ron@@ er catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ nes pat@@ rolled back to a pun@@ t , who was restored in the first district of Minnesota &apos;s Vik@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , in which Hay@@ nes and his massive , Australian authorities were hoping for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ dn &apos;t left the playing field after F@@ um@@ ble and talked later to the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he could not present deterior@@ ating start to his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; it was a thing that happens now , one takes care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ nes . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ nes missed the shar@@ pen@@ er with his Origin debut in 2007 when a pass in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Queensland .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

Ai@@ w@@ anger promp@@ ted the establishment of the UN protective zones for refugees in Syria as it existed during the Yugoslavia &apos;s wars in the 1990s .
&quot; this is how it goes on , we have to go to the causes , &quot; said the free elec@@ torate . &quot;
rejected asylum seek@@ ers want to slide free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ w@@ anger also demanded more staff for administration purposes , which are responsible for asylum compl@@ ac@@ ies : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum in@@ verter &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ w@@ anger . &quot;
the FW @-@ boss critic@@ ised that several German states are not consistent : &quot; we are talking nationwide united standards in the federal states . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria p@@ ushes out , others not . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more efficient , however . &quot;

but Ai@@ w@@ anger is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of the year G9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the FW @-@ chief . &quot;

&quot; 20 police officers and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber feet used , from which it is known to kill them , which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently produced as a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last of several weeks of violent protest in Nep@@ als southern planes , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ rid@@ i say that new provinces would be formed under the proposed new constitution to decrease their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the western Nepal of the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want to have a private state .

&quot; however , it is good to be able to face all of it now . &quot;
&quot; for months , the project has been involved in discussion about ten to 12 million euro . &quot;
&quot; the populations below marine mammals , who came into the meeting , called the pictures and new details to the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , group owner and member of the committee on the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ lieg@@ er , Pro H@@ ie@@ ve , compl@@ ains : &quot; this is a huge cl@@ ot@@ z that out@@ stands all other bones . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he fears as some other project critic , that traffic through the intended size of the plant would be strong : &quot; &quot; all bus charges should come , so that it pays , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; however , what is happening on the well one hectare of the former restaurant is still open . &quot;
there is no operator .
&quot; we must first have to be a safety concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Behr@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; because this still l@@ acked , the development plans were even variable . &quot;

Google starts a double @-@ set campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dou@@ bling fund campaign , which aims to raise 11 million dollars for humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees to destroy the European nations , as they flee from the war and flee to countries . &quot;
&quot; Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announ@@ cing the donations , in his blog . &quot;
&quot; instead of leaving a manager she wrote the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google Assistant , who fled to her family from Kabul , when she was seven years old , about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; during our trip many dark train stations , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and mig@@ rant crisis has grown in Europe , many people look desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organizations , providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global donations raised up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / gu@@ er@@ el@@ ief to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is faced with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven over 4 million people this year . &quot;

for easily overweight diabe@@ tics can be helpful in weight loss .
&quot; after a new study , the benefits of losing weight loss , with type 2 diabetes may take at least five years after a new trial . &quot;
it is too early to say whether it is easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery longer than those who do not get surgical treatments .
&quot; the death data need a long time to show something , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of the weight loss procedure , which wrote a leading article in the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Surgery . &quot;
weight loss operations or obesity @-@ surgery use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach .
you reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s own ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity operations for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has proved efficiently , but most studies have been carried out in humans , the disease @-@ provo@@ king with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BMI ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BMI , a certain degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18@@ ,5 and 24,@@ 9 . &quot;
a BMI of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BMI of 30 are considered to be ob@@ ese .
you can calculate your BMI here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data , who have collected them in a study since 2007 and compared with two types of obesity - mag@@ enb@@ ypass and gast@@ ric examination - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes , which were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BMI among those who under@@ gone surgery , declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the BMI in those who do not received surgical diabetes treatments were approximately equal to 29 . &quot;
among those who under@@ go surgical procedure led to 36 % of the diabetes condition completely and at 28 % partially .
&quot; in comparison , the diabetes actually treated completely at one percent in comparison with the diabetes , and at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were even better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ glyceri@@ des , and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol &quot; , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; researchers also overs@@ aw the patients &quot; blood levels of hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which mirrors the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept by 7 percent , according to researchers . &quot;
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c dropped from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce the mortality in five years , thus the leader of researchers Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compar@@ ably average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ tom@@ y Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) and higher intake levels in BMI ( 7.4 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete over@@ l@@ apping of the diabetes ( 4@@ 6.9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit from surgery over five years , there are notes from a study of heavier man in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , obesity has under@@ gone a number of obesity using a group of obesity , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group un@@ conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is so@@ othing for persons with a BMI of 35 persons interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower at the lower BMI group , with no higher risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient is between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we &apos;re waiting for too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have linked your body with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ r@@ ück Germany
&quot; it is a topic that is presently increasing in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and in@@ consp@@ ic@@ uous , meets years of pleas@@ ures of her youth , and this one loves her in love . &quot;

&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not hold all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called on to stop violence in the refugees of refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke the problem of the prolonged refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit in the United Kingdom , in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Comp@@ assion in Oxford . &quot;
&quot; he demanded that under the conditions of conditions , the interests of humanity should be made prior to the interests of the individual nations or even continents . &quot;
&quot; he also emphas@@ ized that the reaction of the West European countries are ad@@ mi@@ red to the refugee crisis , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama &apos;s Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to comm@@ ing the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; in order to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions as a true peace and genuine development , mainly through education that can be created for these Muslim countries , &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the application of violence has never solved these issues , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence , and commented on George Bush &apos;s actions following the terrorist attack of September 11 , and discovered that the U.S. sei@@ zes a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events . &quot;
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his moti@@ ves were good , but he placed violence , and that caused enormous consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four times increase of taking of suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; poison checks in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swal@@ low strongly alcoholic beverages , so the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants increased from children under 12 years , the poison @-@ control centres , from 3.@@ 266 to 2010 on 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them go in the score , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CNN . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children of disinf@@ ect@@ ants are intenti@@ onally whis@@ ky , while some are doing to im@@ press their friends or for a mutation sample at the social media . &quot;
&quot; videos on YouTube show , how young disinf@@ ect@@ ant are drinking only because of an inexpensive experience . &quot;
&quot; young people are supposed to have disinf@@ ect@@ ant , mixed with alcohol and cold water to maintain a harder drink . &quot;
younger children can be kn@@ itted by attractive no@@ ises of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child thinks this is po@@ or@@ ly for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant ) are those that are par@@ ked .
&quot; there are disinf@@ ect@@ ant with strawberry , grapes , and orange du@@ cks that are very appe@@ aling to children . &quot;
suspension disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
only few sy@@ ring@@ es can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning especially in infants .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Medical Director of the Gi@@ ft@@ ist Center in the Hospital of Kansas , the Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not allow a drink whis@@ key , but people allow this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children are coming , then it is a quick way to consume much alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently picked four sy@@ ring@@ es following the strawberry of strawberry disinf@@ ect@@ ant in school , was taken into an emergency treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 179 , twice higher than the threshold who was legally considered in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency doctor who handled her in the G@@ win@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ ashed her words and wasn &apos;t able to go when she arrived in her emergency .
&quot; doctors sto@@ wed them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma , since the girl had fallen by the alcohol and hit his head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; it was very sc@@ ary , &quot; said Or@@ atory Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ enne &apos;s Mother , CNN . &quot;
it would have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non@@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants to be used outside the child &apos;s operating range .
over alcohol pois@@ oning consisted of some disinf@@ ect@@ ants associated with fat@@ alities .
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario were killed in Ontario after the termination of hand@@ ing disinf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities susp@@ ect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl@@ al@@ op@@ rop@@ yl alcohol , which was an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students from the fourth class in the state of New York left their &quot; common &quot; teacher , &quot; put out their anti@@ bacterial products around the class@@ room , &quot; it mel@@ ts a police report . &quot;
&quot; the teacher is highly allergic against Handel &apos;s disinf@@ ect@@ ant , and banned them from their space . &quot;
the police triggered the dis@@ cour@@ aged plan as &quot; s@@ coff@@ ing &quot; and rejected the disciplinary measures to the school administration .

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays t@@ ede about dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y
there are rum@@ ors of dish@@ ar@@ mon@@ y at Cel@@ tic Glasgow which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under elevated control because they are preparing con@@ frontation with the Dutch Table leader .
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in the Scottish football club bo@@ res - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former Rang@@ ers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands , Ronald de Bo@@ er , said that Dutch fans have lost interest in Cel@@ tic , since there are no title ri@@ val@@ ry with the rank . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of Cel@@ tic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people don &apos;t just talk about the return of the rank .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they speak of both teams and this is what they are interested .
there are a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games and there are not just the people in Scotland who want to see these games .
I will turn things around and swear D@@ eila .
&quot; R@@ onn@@ y D@@ eila accepted that Cel@@ tic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss swore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malmö and the following departure from the Champions League , the defeat against the 10 man from Aber@@ deen , who , now with five points , lead to the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; D@@ eila said , &quot; Cel@@ tic already had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to get out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know , it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly - but we have to go on .
we really need really the support of Cel@@ tic because that makes players better .
now it is so important .

&quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago , which pointed out that he ra@@ ped several January transfers , Rang@@ ers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is carefully ple@@ dged to inter@@ fere with the signing of new ones and insi@@ sted that he does not b@@ other the unit of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad . &quot;
Br@@ ent@@ ford &apos;s ex @-@ boss said : &quot; the January @-@ Transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; players who come in summer have this pre@@ season period to integrate what you &apos;ve seen with our own group in this season . &quot;

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged and rising in the United Kingdom .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged during the period of May to July at 16@@ 4,000 , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom as a whole in the same period increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was on the revenue of the 5.5 per cent , including the figures for the National Statistics Office ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the employment in Scotland lost 12,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12,000 . &quot;
the unemployment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent over the course of the quarter - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent .
&quot; commenting on the recent figures , State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell said : &quot; the long @-@ term plan of government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; in these 12 months , we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish job market with an increase in unemployment and decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I will be a sei@@ z@@ ure of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; something later , except at a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in an audience @-@ gallery in the upper chamber at the O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the syr@@ inge . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses to his death .
&quot; the invitation was first mentioned for the first time in January of his best friend , and although I was sho@@ cked , I agree . &quot;
&quot; when the day was closer , I started to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agree , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the USA , and since often more applications are available as places , a ma@@ ier lot@@ tery takes place to decide who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I cannot do that .
&quot; I will sit alongside Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps , with whom I developed my own relationship during months with telephone calls and a two and a half hour visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh so much when we speak .
&quot; the Pr@@ ison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be permitted to me , a not@@ ebook &amp; pen , in order to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
&quot; a journalist from O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , to im@@ pose my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
this is the lesson .
&quot; tell the story of the in@@ mates , as he wants , and you will get access . &quot;
I compl@@ ained to you .
&quot; she admitted that she could &quot; &quot; could feel better &quot; , &quot; but she still thinks it is wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses to any time .
but he wants an international reporter to be present in order to write .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a reporter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit on me beside me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about this case , please hear the series po@@ d@@ casts , which I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back all details here .
I cannot tell you that Richard Glos@@ s@@ p is innocent .
his actions following the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese will sl@@ ay him to be a star@@ ving act .
&quot; but I think a strong probability exists , that it is not guilty of murder . &quot;
&quot; I believe there is no proof of evidence , to justify a death sentence . &quot;
I think his execution is wrong .
and from that perspective I &apos;ll see him die .
I can &apos;t say really objec@@ tively .
there will be other rep@@ orters to which you can turn around .
&quot; what you will get from me is what it means to see a man without any unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; sometimes you re@@ acts , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to do with that which I have said . &quot;
I am going to go home this evening and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk around the head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best to them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
&quot; I should remember , what I do with my license . &quot;
&quot; previously , Moo@@ dy had forced the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com for his ability to energi@@ ze its stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Terry Bailey , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Stewart in a room with a man - whom I will name when I am asked - and offered him an employment in my st@@ ables , in order to deliver information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
it seems that I &apos;m an Bet@@ at@@ cher .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly prove themselves to their n@@ oses , because they are trying to hold me anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former chairman of the RV@@ L , David Moo@@ dy , current CEO of RV@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of the RV@@ L , were aware of that today and are still today . &quot;
would it take me to believe that it &apos;s personal ?
has the RV@@ L rest@@ rained and perhaps people outside of train@@ ers are responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I po@@ or@@ ly for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
perhaps people think out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to take me my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can think about it now . &quot;
&quot; but now I have arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will exercise the pressure on them and pushing them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; during the long @-@ term cob@@ alt @-@ study at Li@@ dar@@ i , the Train@@ ers &apos; Fru@@ it levels have built and the Late S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching blade has led to him that he could throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ secured Master &apos;s Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridic@@ ulous &quot; after a package lu@@ dge or sound had been applied to the hor@@ rors , which viol@@ ates the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of race transport .
&quot; I have to take over responsibility for it , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators has ir@@ radi@@ ated mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
yesterday it could be like yesterday all the day that was how it was like that .
but it had so on the race end .
Moo@@ dy could face a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the pack on the racing day . an investigation into this matter has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; people who establish these rules , don &apos;t know anything about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need a rules , but here you have to go too far , &quot; said Moo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy fights against ri@@ vals due to alleg@@ ations
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the tac@@ kling his player as &quot; Agenda @-@ S@@ etting &quot; of two Premier League favor@@ ites at the N@@ RL .
Sydney Roo@@ ster coach Tr@@ ent Robinson noted that the judges will have the Storm @-@ Player &quot; ring struggle &quot; with his team during the high Storm @-@ victory at the qualifying finals in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Brisbane Bron@@ co Trainer Wayne Bennett did not cover the Storm @-@ Team , after his team had made the Final victory against North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; exempl@@ ar example &quot; of the Rug@@ by League and said that the two from Queensland do not too good &quot; too good . &quot; &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the tor@@ ch of his team and said they were only concentr@@ ating on the tac@@ kling on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leaders in his crew agree to it , as it was meant that they should be worried about the Storm @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; this is always up again - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring battle when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed anything in our def@@ ensive system or techniques throughout the year , but in the last six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ kl@@ es , and that made us the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
Tr@@ ent is now there for three years and he has obviously done a great team . he &apos;s probably not getting used to lose it so it was a bit of shock for him .
&quot; it is strange , as it emerg@@ es again at this time of the year . &quot;
Bell@@ amy has found the idea of a thr@@ illing soccer team and he reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ ings St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring playing soccer . &quot;
Wayne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; Bell@@ amy said . &quot;
I remember that in 2010 St George was crit@@ ici@@ zed as a boring team and Wayne was saying that he was going to take care of a cra@@ ck of that .
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play if you have this type of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all its kind of soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hunt , so they can play as they can play . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried about to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it comes to the Big Games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also proved that the game Storm and Roo@@ ster made a higher score than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ co was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts at our game , but is it an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks doing and are not points cl@@ amping ?
&quot; for me , there are the sched@@ ules . &quot;
&quot; once they mention us , it means that we will still be able to meet them in a phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm @-@ Team has free at this weekend as they won right , either North Queensland Co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Shar@@ ks at the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales starts next Tuesday morning . &quot;
Serbia with $ 200,000 deposit to drug an@@ kl@@ age
&quot; a man who possibly threatened to have a li@@ fel@@ ong sentence because of his attempt to get to the possession of 40 kilograms of co@@ ca@@ ine , was released to Queensland to be released by a $ 200,000 deposit . &quot;
&quot; Marko Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the police had found 100 kg of the drug on the Yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America to V@@ anu@@ at@@ u and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed , how he met his co @-@ def@@ endants during the early morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life imprisonment for the attempt to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , he argu@@ ed that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole amount and that in the café could have been a harmless basis . &quot;
judge on the Supreme Court of Justice at Peter Flan@@ agan was concerned about the danger of flight at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic .
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he declared the Tribunal on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the criminal , he lied to the police on his residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mov@@ ics &apos;s mother and step @-@ in @-@ law had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together to ensure his release . &quot;
&quot; following the reading of the two persons , it is clear that the circulation of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Fl@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not be sufficient to stop him , not to appear , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released by security deposit , under the conditions that he announces his Australian and its Serb passport the police open daily , and at a cur@@ few days from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident on A5 near Karlsruhe : desc@@ endant ri@@ ps apart
&quot; at a reception accident with three trucks on the highway 5 at Karlsruhe , a truck driver has been seriously injured in the Tuesday night . &quot;
&quot; two of the three participating trucks slow@@ ed down in front of a permanent centre , in direction of Basel . &quot;
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying to devi@@ ate in vain for the last minute , as the police ra@@ ced . &quot;
the leader of the accident @-@ causing rent is completely scattered .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
&quot; the A5 auto@@ clave between Bru@@ k@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord , closed from six hours until 2 o &apos;clock . &quot;

Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g used a telephone of girls to attract ped@@ oph@@ ile to the end of pictures
a ped@@ op@@ hil@@ es used the telephone of an 11 year old girl to request photographs of child abuse .
&quot; Stev@@ an H@@ og@@ g took the phone of the girl , when this slept , logged into an online mess@@ aging service , which he received a series of un@@ attached pictures of children sent from another user . &quot;
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping H@@ og@@ g .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using news and immediately al@@ arms her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of that and saw the five pictures , analysed then computers that were found under the address and found &quot; &quot; Web @-@ resear@@ ches , &quot; which used to search for non@@ sense images of children . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g then said against the officials , that he would have done it because it would lead to &quot; P@@ ump@@ oph@@ ile in the internet , &quot; and he then &quot; gave up a polic@@ eman to be troubled . &quot;
&quot; the State lawyer E@@ ili@@ dh Robertson told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a ad@@ diction , that he may be ho@@ oked . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer were carried out of him , but said it was done , because he wanted to claim a polic@@ eman to be sc@@ ared to ped@@ oph@@ ile . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent the pictures and asked him to send him more photos .
he said that he did it to attract her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said , he would then see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Robertson , added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was at the trem@@ ors and weeping . &quot;
she then saw the un@@ intelligent images on the phone and con@@ front the def@@ endants .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said that the accused def@@ endant computer and Play@@ station , to speak with girls who saw a lot younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; H@@ og@@ g , 23 , Ward Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , was found guilty on the meaning of the indictment , un@@ attached images of children on the 14th of June last year to viol@@ ate the charges and not to appear before the court hearing on 24 March of this year . &quot;
&quot; he asked that H@@ og@@ g appears not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because one can argue that there is no significant sexual element in his actions . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sp@@ ends the verdict of October to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case , H@@ og@@ g was given the security deposit , but was kept in provisional custody due to others . &quot;
he was still taken before the date of judgment in the directory of sexual offen@@ ders .
blocks do@@ dging to small border @-@ trans@@ itions to Germany
increasingly more refugees will be taken along the Grand @-@ Austrian border on the border of the Austrian @-@ Austrian border .
many of the houses made from fear of discovery and capture the people in smaller border trans@@ itions
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police stated . &quot;
&quot; along the border to the border , Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al Inn were taken up more than 1000 refugees in the coun@@ ties of Pass@@ au and R@@ ott@@ al Inn . &quot;
they were on foot on bridges and sto@@ wage to the German side .
&quot; in the event , they will be arrested by federal agents and for@@ warded to registration . &quot;
&quot; according to the German police station , in comparison to the early morning of Wednesday , more refugees meet again in the Munich Main Railway station . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the provincial capital alone until 8.00 , a speaker on the morning . &quot;
&quot; following the re@@ introduction of inspec@@ tions at the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city . &quot;
&quot; Stuttgart : for@@ erun@@ ners of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; in the Sou@@ thwest are expected &quot;
meteor@@ ologist warned against crash site in the Sou@@ thwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; because of a deep @-@ depth area on Western Europe , warm ocean air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( D@@ WD ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the strong low@@ f was the for@@ erunner of the drop hammer &quot; Henry , &quot; who had moved into the Atlantic in the last days of the Bermuda islands . &quot;
storms and thunder@@ storms are expected primarily in Baden .
&quot; according to D@@ WD , there are still up to Thursday early in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District with ar@@ ches ranging from 60 to 90 hour kilometers . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun will again look back to the sun again . &quot;
the mass only makes it : all the two years show the motor car at the International Motor Show .
&quot; in 2015 , especially the motion for the compact bal@@ ances , which is especially well @-@ selling . &quot;
&quot; cars from the compact class are particularly popular : some 28,@@ 1 percent of all appro@@ vals , according to the German Federal Office ( KBA ) , accounted for this segment in August alone . &quot;
this is reflected at the International Motor Show ( audience days September 17 @-@ 27 ) .
&quot; between all the fut@@ ur@@ istic construction and new luxury class vehicles and luxury cars , many new compact models will be presented this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premier@@ es in the German car line is the Opel Astra , coming from dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the brand &apos;s core .
&quot; this means that the volume model also sells well , the new Astra is also not much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents its entry under the largest compet@@ itor VW Golf in the view , starting at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the Hessen is offering further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , which also includes three @-@ cylinder gasoline engine . &quot;
&quot; unlike the main competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is launched first just as a five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow the spring of the com@@ bi , which is also shown at the IAA Motor Show . &quot;
and what &apos;s next to the Astra at the IAA ( International Motor Show ) ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of his Astra @-@ compet@@ itor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the trade show , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively the five @-@ door in a conventional and a high@@ lighting GT @-@ Version . &quot;
&quot; it comes to trade at the beginning of next year , then either as a com@@ bi . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : totally new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan @-@ off@@ springs will be able to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly in the design line of the brand . &quot;
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
&quot; in the offer , a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp . &quot;
&quot; Suzuki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Suzuki Bal@@ eno , which made its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo@@ charged engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is 170 Newton metres ( Nm ) according to the specification .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed , the compact class of compact car model DS 4 , which is shown at the IAA 2013 . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Citroën @-@ Ab@@ alloy laid hands on the front part of the front panel : the radiator gr@@ ille was re@@ drawn , and the changed head@@ lights have been equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; inside the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system has been moderni@@ zed , reducing the number of buttons through a touch@@ screen and for the first time release Apple TV . &quot;
&quot; at the IAA in the compact class , there was a series of over@@ work and new variants like the folded Mercedes A @-@ Class or Peugeot 308 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are human @-@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ in@@ mate of the pen@@ it@@ ary family of Te@@ gel , which has been accommod@@ ated in a small cell in months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human rights , prisoners are generally entit@@ ling to financial compensation if they are integrated into small cells . &quot;
this decision has decided in a decision by the Federal Constitutional Court on Wednesday .
those concerning the judges cannot then trust the judges in the case if they were imprisoned only a few days in the confin@@ ed spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) .
&quot; thus , an ex @-@ in@@ mate was successful with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who has remained on the other hand according to his instructions , was laid down in a bigger cell . &quot;
his office cler@@ ks because of the bad detention conditions against the country of Berlin fails .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court took the verdict of the chamber of chamber of chamber Berlin and rejected the case for re@@ trial . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s human dignity .
Kammer@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal now decides on the amount of the compensation
&quot; even if there were legal reasons for the frag@@ ile period only a few days of dis@@ age for the compensation , be a compensation for compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , it would be necessary to worry of the legal protection of the personality . &quot;
the chamber @-@ court must now clarify the amount of money bur@@ ial .
the constitutional complaint have often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; so they did not ask for damages only in April of a prisoner , because he was imprisoned naked in a prison cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision in 2011 , human beings have also been linked to a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , the Court of Berlin confirmed a decent housing for a in@@ comparable accommodation on Wednesday , on Wednesday as a prisoner in a parallel event in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff ranged from 15 to 21 hours every day in a similar cell like in the Karlsruhe Case .
the Berlin &apos;s pris@@ ons have occurred in the head@@ lines for the last few weeks .
&quot; prisoners are therefore included again 23 hours , if the aggressi@@ veness , it should already have come true because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Palace of Justice , 21 places were not occupied in Te@@ gel for young@@ sters , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we are creating this &quot;
immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the ch@@ anc@@ ellor is decided to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to forecasts from the German Federal Ministry of Education in Germany , some 800 000 asylum seek@@ ers come to Germany according to the statement of Vice @-@ Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is able to absorb a million refugees . &quot;
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) demonstrated the extraordinary challenge for determination : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we create that .
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; after different progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Justice ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the Pest@@ el @-@ Institute ) apartments annually , and the next five years . &quot;
that is almost twice as much as it has been built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing , but most of all for affordable properties , fall from 60@@ 000 to 80@@ 000 social apartments from the rental price , and in order to apply these particularly favourable apartments will also apply refugees . &quot;
Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) aims to double the funding of currently 5@@ 18 million to a billion euros .
&quot; a lot too little too little - from the point of view of the pest@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to arise and therefore , the federal government would have to invest some 6.4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; in fact , scientists and Federal Minister for the Federal Minister is that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research and Voc@@ ational Research , it is assumed that 55 percent of the population in Germany may be employed . &quot;
&quot; however , refugees in Germany would not have been properly claimed according to their qualification round , with Claudia Walter , a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann @-@ Foundation . &quot;
&quot; however , for the integration of refugees , however , is crucial if they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; job is the key to social contacts , for the este@@ em in the recording group , but also for the self @-@ este@@ em of the immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ ill@@ hardt , a political turn was given : for@@ b@@ ade for refugees in recognition of work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a job ban on asylum seek@@ ers from up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation to asylum seek@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the lack of trade , the visibility sever@@ ed that refugees should be made faster to the labour market . &quot;
a big hur@@ dle for access to the job market are lack of German language skills .
&quot; so far , there is no sufficient supply of general and professional language courses . &quot;
&quot; in addition , research shows that jobs are most frequently convey@@ ed by personal contacts . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the structure of networks is , according to the view of Thr@@ ill@@ hardt , the Royal Path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has found that only a few wing@@ ed parents present their children in the Kit@@ as , estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the ro@@ oted parents , it is only very important to keep the family , &quot; says Il@@ ja Kos@@ chem@@ bar , spokes@@ man for youth and family at Berlin &apos;s Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; however , to convince the family from the advantages of the K@@ ita , the board is distribut@@ ing hand@@ writing in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need to educ@@ ate for a large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate aims to raise the training capacities by the Berlin Senate - to appro@@ ve more of the universities . &quot;
students without the German language skills are prepared in their class@@ room classes .
&quot; they are not always trained as well trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers who only have an qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
there is no lack of evidence : Be@@ ate jams from Berlin &apos;s school administration .
the German student body estimates that around 20 percent of the refugees are going to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no Bundes@@ land prohibited asylum seek@@ ers or vac@@ ill@@ ers in studies - the only exception was Berlin , Dom@@ ens@@ en@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CDU ) and has abandoned its attitude . &quot;
study grants refugees can be facil@@ itated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or Dul@@ ce NO , there will be no more services according to the asylum seek@@ er act more when they begin studying . &quot;
the latter basically got a B@@ Af@@ ö@@ t as they do not fall under the inner circle of the options .
&quot; unprecedented refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany in order to be entitled to B@@ ish@@ ö@@ G @-@ entitled , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financial officer must be closed , but for Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Karlsruhe student union . &quot;
the students should immediately get B@@ Af@@ ö@@ G .
&quot; Islam will play a most important role in future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is more important than their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should step down under Islam , under the same rights as they have the churches , and the existing State churches right to develop a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
this would also be important to the creation of a Islamic welfare state that takes care of the new@@ com@@ ers .
please also belong to the rights .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must unite to clear contacts for some and ready to cooperate with the State in many areas and to give him certain controls . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the read@@ iness to take their hearts against religious Fund@@ ament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the chairman of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , is the answer to the care , religious conflicts could also be applied to Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted those conflicts in Germany have failed , &quot; immediately failed their right to stay here in Germany , &quot; &quot; he said in the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed the Basic Law on Arabic .
integration will soon be a subject of society today .
&quot; in this way , the majority shareholder will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and rac@@ ism will become more urgent . &quot;
&quot; Germany , although - as a result of European decisions - has caused an anti @-@ discrimination station and a criminal law in law since one decade ago . &quot;
but it is very slow as the NSU trial showed that the NSU trial showed the rac@@ ist motive more systematically in the police and authorities .
&quot; equal chances for everyone : what migrants organisations and stakeholders have been calling for long and why international agreements like the anti @-@ rac@@ es@@ convention in Germany , must be repeated in the next few years if the country should remain peaceful and utili@@ ze their new citizens - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is capable of providing medi@@ cally care of the expected refugees so far as medi@@ ator Frank Mont@@ gom@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; regarding Man@@ - Power and capacities , we create the &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must be flowing into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ gom@@ ery , in all deliveries abroad equals to the registration of health . &quot;
&quot; later , services could be accounted for later by federal states . &quot;
and in the long @-@ term it is highly question@@ able so many people see the limited range of performance in the asylum of asylum seek@@ ers .
&quot; otherwise , doctors do especially make the language boundaries . &quot;
&quot; so far , so far , the Berlin healthcare scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proved to be worse affected over their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; in clinics , not only in clinics , also in medical practices , interpre@@ ting costs are required . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees have also been helped with more general medical interventions in emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic look .
&quot; among the refugee camps , there are clearly more un@@ treated people , and with the young people , it is about HIV education . &quot;
&quot; Mont@@ gom@@ ery is clear , with the other cases of disease . but at the same time , Mont@@ gom@@ ery gains . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite people or tuberculosis are not so difficult to recognise . &quot; and what the medical angel is concerned , either by the refugees and even alle@@ vi@@ ation in sight . &quot;
the Syrians have a highly developed educational system . some refugees were even doctors .
&quot; to practice , however , they would have to reject and re@@ comp@@ ile their quali@@ fications . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany according to the post @-@ psychological psych@@ otherap@@ eutic medicine ( B@@ Pt@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress failure or in depres@@ sions .
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable to refugees , says Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ Pt@@ K . &quot;
a recent published study of the TU Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee movement is trau@@ mat@@ ized in Germany .
&quot; anyone who suffers from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress system suffers , amongst others , so @-@ called Flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , dizziness , heart pal@@ pit@@ falls and fat@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; further symptoms are sleeping and concentration disorders , severe terr@@ and and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms of chronic , an early treatment would be necessary , said Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; so far , only four percent of psych@@ ologically ill refugees received a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill asylum seek@@ ers may place an application for psych@@ otherapy , usually the processing takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , social workers , or doctors , who are not trained in the social diseases , would determine whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to false ass@@ essments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new st@@ aging &quot; passion &quot; Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst returns to the traditions of the cir@@ cus art .
the aim is to pull every age group in the B@@ ann of intri@@ gu@@ ing acro@@ b@@ atics and animal dres@@ sings and in@@ sist@@ ent entertainment .
now the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst invites the man@@ ege on the tiles of was@@ ps to dreams .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst , animal teacher and junior schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto the current man@@ tra @-@ stage faces . &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the gift to am@@ aze the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to take away the people from their daily b@@ ass@@ oon and take it into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year old junior . &quot;
&quot; collabor@@ ating with world @-@ city fl@@ air , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities along the nearly 3,000 kilometres long tour can now be experienced by this fl@@ air . &quot;
the cir@@ cus programme convinced by talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; excellent at the International Cir@@ cus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v clo@@ wn Family re@@ treats the public with joke and charm in their sp@@ ell . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their handic@@ raft .
the heroes of the St@@ umm@@ ert films will make the Cuban duo loose .
light@@ ness and flexibility - they identify themselves with these words .
her hum@@ orous art in the mast must conquer women &apos;s hearts in the storm .
&quot; except through many salmon fill@@ ings , the Cir@@ cus promot@@ ers also intri@@ gu@@ ed the feeling of finger@@ tip and joint . &quot;
balance your wheel on a sphere ?
there is no problem for He Yuan .
fascin@@ ate and sc@@ ared at the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is the oldest form of acro@@ b@@ atics as little different and fascin@@ ated by her flexibility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every way .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphas@@ izes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
problems in the attitude of circulation are just too often subject with different animal protection organisations .
&quot; Stephanie Pro@@ bst also takes a position in this position : &quot; if not our animals are well , we don &apos;t go well . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoyed every string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged arti@@ stes , &quot; as they are aff@@ ection@@ ately called , will be read after every wish of his eyes . &quot;
we want to engage with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel well , it does not want to go into the man@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; the first commandment is , Well , for the animals . &quot;
&quot; especially on their zeb@@ y Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land@@ Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a zeb@@ ra@@ st@@ mare , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in a fence and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little jum@@ bo was &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; although the abs is not ready for the man@@ ege , but this is the unique mascot of the Cir@@ cus promot@@ er . &quot;
this should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Stephanie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter whether five or 1 200 people , we always give our best and are with all your heart . &quot;
&quot; the Cir@@ cus Pro@@ bst welcomes his ideas from 17 to 20 September a day , between 17 and 20 September . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the program begins at 11 am and 4 pm . &quot;
&quot; Thursday , for the presentation at 17 o &apos;clock the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; moreover , it is open daily from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
&quot; simulation of Zimbabwe , Robert Mug@@ abe is holding a false speech in parliament &quot;
&quot; Mr Mug@@ abe , Africa &apos;s oldest leader , heads down the stairs at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ hurt , but the video of the case spread rapidly across the social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by statement by members of the opposition , that they had received an anonymous death penalty and warned them against calling the speech by Mr Mug@@ abe with Bu@@ ehr@@ er . &quot;
&quot; last month they pulled him out and interrupted him , during his speech to the State of the Nation in Parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) Inno@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition polit@@ ician &apos;s SMS messages have received on their cell phones that warned them against Mr. Mug@@ ab@@ es .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not given , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalists in Mug@@ ab@@ it &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the parliamentary members , that the immun@@ ity in parliament ends , and as soon as they left the parliament , and her parliamentary immun@@ ity is no longer effective . &quot;
&quot; the chief speaker , guided by Morgan Ts@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i , is concerned about the dangers for the politicians . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will build up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will likely decrease 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the company &apos;s re@@ structure and savings efforts . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will share the commercial and business activities of its fast @-@ growing company hardware and business business activities this year . &quot;
&quot; decisive job , resulting in a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive that should lead the unity after separation . &quot;
He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is smaller and more focused on HP today and we have a broad and deep@@ ening portfolio of stores that support companies in transition to a new style of business . &quot; Whit@@ man said .
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than EUR 50 billion , and is expected to be non @-@ achievement , integrated technology solutions for businesses &quot; , &quot; such an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it divi@@ des a company founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , who has been called &quot; &quot; the birth@@ place of the Silicon Valley &quot; &quot; by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard . &quot;
HP has gone through a massive re@@ structure to handle the return of traditional PCs into mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. high @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area that is based on the conviction that the focused businesses can offer a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal ski@@ pper Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb just behind the past Jack Wil@@ th@@ ere game
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that there is only September and unless its rehabilitation is progres@@ sing according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimi@@ stic scenario is already known , that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will miss at least the next four matches for England and in view of his story is surely uncertain at the European Championship in the next summer . &quot;
&quot; the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate Kn@@ uck@@ les injury , and then back to its old moment@@ um during the pre@@ season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of injury is not threatened by career , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , that has not been healed . &quot;
this is no larger matter .
this was just an accident .
&quot; it was not in touch with its Kn@@ uck@@ les , or with the injuries he had previously . &quot;
&quot; this may be true from purely medical sight , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the appropriate danger of further injuries , always when a player tries to return in the middle of season . &quot;
it also develops a pleasant pattern .
the study by Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd lists 23 different illnesses from Wil@@ th@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
&quot; he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ as , 157 Lig@@ asp@@ en in the last five play@@ times . &quot;
the wider image for arsen@@ al is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight play@@ times since 2007 / 08 who have the most vulnerable days .
&quot; Wen@@ ger considers the potential of a v@@ icious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that an improvement in the frequency of injuries will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you return from a violation , you have a temporary period of time , in which you have to strengthen your body and gain battle force , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he is going through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
Arsenal begins its Champions League @-@ season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the games against Chelsea in Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday and Wen@@ ger represents a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ ctor Bell@@ er@@ ín , and Aaron Ram@@ sey are not travelled to Croatia , meaning Math@@ ieu Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Olivier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to hold the balance and the players who need to indul@@ ge a small break @-@ break , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; even though Arsenal are clear favour@@ ites via group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir Stadium in Zagreb is one of the playing fields with the largest registration effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is un@@ defeated after 41 games , after the inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign in the last season has been launched . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake which was measured on the Richter scale , 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the last season with the Champions League &apos;s capit@@ ulation to Monaco , continuing with his management to lead the club to his first European y@@ ok@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this impulse is immense , &quot; &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
it has never worked for Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are no dre@@ amer . &quot;
Friend@@ ship Fest : the com@@ edy show that grants us serious lessons on men &apos;s experiences
&quot; the absence of similar depic@@ tions in shows is obvious , especially in terms of how the need for men to open themselves now has become more desper@@ ate than ever before , as self @-@ murder among young men on a 15 @-@ year test@@ ch prove . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and three times more frequently in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , Camp@@ aign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ries ( CA@@ LM - Camp@@ aign against a p@@ iti@@ ful life ) 2015 , announced the year of the man to ask the culture in question who are seeking to seek help , if they need these . &quot;
friendship is the heart of struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study of more than 2,000 high @-@ school students diagnosed with depres@@ sive symptoms that , if the suff@@ erer had a sufficient high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy m@@ oods , &quot; his chances of being doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of spiritual and wholes@@ ome the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course , you have to have friends only once a friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of dealing with social media , with their focus on style on substance , the answer is often more important than important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life have the need to appear strong , fun and successful , doubled , even if in reality the isolation is dominated . &quot;
&quot; this superf@@ icial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists ex@@ tr@@ insi@@ ic values call ; money , image , social status , everything on costs in@@ tr@@ insi@@ c values - our inner desire for personal development and friendship that affect our spiritual health a lot more deeply . &quot;
and like a vide@@ og@@ ame @-@ inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire declared that money can really not buy happiness .
the beauty of friends was that this focus was on the head .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , shining through the interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the hum@@ our of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler Frequ@@ ent h@@ ugs , Mom@@ ents of the football gu@@ ar in cozy sh@@ ackl@@ es and the nostal@@ gia of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can rely on every case , even though they often fall back to explore their emotions . &quot;
&quot; like a employee of the telephone welfare , it told me : ... &quot; my listen@@ ers for people who feel de@@ pressed and sel@@ fre@@ t at risk has really shown me how even the smallest inter@@ actions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
&quot; the men who contact us often , are often not able to speak to friends . &quot;
&quot; the old speech &quot; &quot; I come on entitled &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness , when you face problems exposed to problems . &quot;
&quot; friends is one of the shows that comes to me in mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term regulatory mechanisms . &quot;
they clearly presented the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective ground@@ ocean status on the phone the people in moments of desp@@ air may also help , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so if you visit this weekend Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ ship with which to celebrate the day is totally new , why don &apos;t you take your friends at a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better when you &apos;re sitting around Star@@ bu@@ cks one alone , give it a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what the difference could make your friendship .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to end - the entire 236 Ep@@ iso@@ - for the # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Mary meets PS@@ G in order to grin@@ d Malmö
angel Di Mary celebrates her hits against Malmö with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ i@@ di and Edinburgh
&quot; with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , PS@@ G helps to pass on Malmö . &quot;
here are the report and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and Edinburgh T@@ ani held this circuit , considered Paris Saint @-@ Germain to celebrate his Champions League Cup with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the stadium stadium on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; earlier than four minutes after the start of his Champions League Deb@@ ts than PS@@ G players , who brought the French Master on the way , but afterwards they missed a number of occasions , before she finally increased their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head @-@ goal in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and S@@ acht@@ j@@ or Donetsk also in the group A , Paris requires a strong start to the Swedish master since it is not only stri@@ ving the qualification for the K.@@ O@@ .-@@ Ro@@ ots , but improvement on the way to the quarter final in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but as they got the points , there was no gam@@ iel from Laurent Bl@@ anc@@ s team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mov@@ ics mixed opportunities in front of the gate . he became later in the game against his home @-@ town team and against the club , with which he started his play@@ ful career back in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or out in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start , 2 : 0 to win our opponents to cause problems and relaxed , even if there are certain things we have to perfect during the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we &apos;ve won , although I regret it &apos;s not one or two more gates . &quot;
&quot; after his injury in one of three modifications to the Paris @-@ Team , this resulted in a 2 : 2 Un@@ decided in its own place versus Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stolen by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian whis@@ per@@ er was called the man who was taking the PS@@ G to the next level in Europe when he was taken over to the next month of Manchester United , and he interpreted as he entered in Marco Ver@@ r@@ att@@ is Pass behind the Malmö @-@ Defense before he finished in the long corner of the multilingual network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a big victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Cel@@ tic went on an Play @-@ off to reach this level , stood at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field exc@@ ites a serious ad@@ versaries . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic who passing far to Kevin Tra@@ pps pads in the 3@@ 4th minute , they had little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes reli@@ es on , with some mal@@ formations and bad effects , not least because of the five experiments alone in the first half , and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used him after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he showed a lot more skill when he brought his players into the game , and it was a pass from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , the Di Maria was transformed into a shooting down by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the p@@ inn@@ est ... &quot;
the second gate finally fell shortly after the hours @-@ brand thanks to the Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans thus scored his six season gate after cop@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had f@@ ished a left fl@@ ank of Max@@ well .
&quot; it finished all the thought that Malmö into the game could come back , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , the final score could be low before a substitute E@@ ke@@ qu@@ ill Lav@@ e@@ zzi became a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League play was last year . &quot;
&quot; since then , we only played in the Swedish league , which does not have the same level . &quot;
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off before Paris !
it was a great game of them !

X@@ avi : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola prevented 2008 changing to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ avi is playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern obviously stood just before the obligation of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ avi , which played at the time for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times winner champion , four times champion champion , two times champion champion , two times champion , a time champion - the title list of X@@ avi is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left the FC Barcelona after 24 years and moved to Qatar for the Al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ avi tells us that he was before the exit from Barcelona in 2008 . &quot;
they told me Bar@@ ça would sell me .
&quot; back in Madrid , everything was going to &quot; , &quot; he told nothing . &quot;
and the registered also FC Bayern .
X@@ avi : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ s wanted me to have me , too . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder : in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over the FC Bayern . &quot;
Gu@@ ardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ avi was not changed
but the bill was not come about .
and the winning husband is now working for the German record champion : P@@ EP Gu@@ ardi@@ ola .
X@@ avi explains why : &quot; Bar@@ ça is taking Gu@@ ardi@@ ola under the contract and I played a great EM .

Matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in movie shap@@ ing
&quot; Matt Dam@@ on con@@ front the af@@ ro@@ american filmmaker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion on the variety and said , she would not be needed behind the scenes . &quot;
&quot; during a sequence of Sunday night of H@@ BO@@ s Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown who emphas@@ ised the need of alternative perspectives , referring to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen screen@@ play of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , please do it with the occupation of the film and not with the instr@@ umentation of the show &quot; , &quot; Dam@@ on . &quot;
Brown re@@ acted sho@@ cked with offensive dis@@ belief and called &quot; HO@@ O ! Wow . okay . &quot; okay when comments of the actors from The Mar@@ tian replied .
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown closed the production ring Ben li@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to encourage people to think about it - who will always be the director , as she must treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nut@@ shell , which is beaten by their white sal@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ er White people sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ ac@@ cio for direct rights to the film ; Dam@@ on answered that her direction &quot; &quot; could give us something that we don &apos;t want to . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ appro@@ ve about Dam@@ ons &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni de@@ pressed his rage over the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; talks about the only black person in the room , so he can tell her diversity - it &apos;s SO KNO@@ WS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et se@@ al@@ ded more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Lik@@ es since its release . &quot;
&quot; women &apos;s comments come at a time , reminiscent of the precise ra@@ ci@@ ally representation in the media at the head of the social discussion . &quot;
&quot; when the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officers , the movement Black Li@@ ves achieved nationwide influence and urged the legisl@@ ature and authorities , discri@@ min@@ ating practices against col@@ oring . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a nod to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Grammy Awards .
&quot; records silent , ( albums still have their mean@@ ings ) , he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their importance . &quot;

&quot; for the last task , the climbing of a 75 foot race in 30 seconds belonged to the climbing . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task within the time he finished the first Ath@@ let , which finished the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American Ninja Warrior . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished the challenge for three seconds faster than vic@@ tor . &quot;
Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with E ! News after the hard fought victory and still under the shock over the winning of the Great Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or about life , &quot; said Isaac E ! about his own lot of money . &quot;
as suddenly .. I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood rep@@ orters to discuss the finals and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished first at all of the circuit , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , money is the fastest one . &quot;

&quot; how much the money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he was swe@@ pt over that .
he is just so lucky to have done what he has done .
&quot; crowds of awards , he received from fans . &quot;
he is such a great guy and a family @-@ grandfather .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that there is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think Isaac would have felt that same , if they had been ver@@ ed the roles . &quot;

Detroit Tig@@ ers ne@@ aks to Minnesota T@@ wins over
MIN@@ NE@@ WS L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the tig@@ ers stand on the last square in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field . &quot;
the T@@ wins lost a chance to climb up the ascent within a player of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ card @-@ Platz .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , there was a return of the three letters F @-@ word , which was so difficult to deal with a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories have fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ sie . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two steps , then in the sixth and then once in ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed six times to 1 / 3 inside and gave it possible to three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I will end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ bar every game , and so I really wants to go into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger H@@ itter Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit match of Mart@@ ine@@ z , ever since he had four hits to Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he sho@@ cked the b@@ ony wood well , &quot; &quot; said Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the kick training ) , he saw clearly better from the bull@@ bar , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back@@ side at the end of the seventh ma@@ iden , T@@ wins had their best chance to get into play again . &quot;
center F@@ iel@@ der Byron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field .
&quot; right F@@ iel@@ der Aaron H@@ icks hit a colorful , and Simon delivered his second Baz@@ eman Brian Do@@ zer for stro@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the handed over Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy was over to the wall , the only man who was confron@@ ted with whom he was confron@@ ted with the desig@@ na@@ iled ro@@ ok@@ ie of Miguel S@@ ano , who had the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w dis@@ comfort a two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of sho@@ res and the finishing @-@ run on the second earned the third St@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe on a double play .
it was the major league premi@@ er 27 times in this season that pl@@ ou@@ ffe got a double play .
&quot; after Detroit added an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inside , the wall made a R@@ BI double to the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the status of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; with the right @-@ handed , however , S@@ ano come out with three pit@@ ches for his fifth Save . &quot;
Detroit benef@@ ited from the start of the game by an even non @-@ moving Phil Hughes .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three quarters of three R@@ uns in the first two ma@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted before the game of the injury mostly over a month . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for myself , &quot; said Hughes , &quot; but I felt wo@@ w when I got off and felt that I would create some pretty good pitch because in the third inning . &quot;
after winning in the first to the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter there was a single second to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler .
&quot; a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought him to the game , who made a single &quot; &quot; up the middle &quot; &quot; to the first run of the game . &quot;
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z made his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ ners in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , made another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third on what the threat had ended . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers were placed in the second , an one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out single from Center @-@ F@@ iel@@ der Anthony G@@ ose to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a great blow , &quot; &quot; T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he was not very well kno@@ cked , but he caught the right spot . &quot;
&quot; Hughes was a Martin @-@ Count on a Pit@@ ch @-@ Count , he scored no points in the third inning as he was replaced by the Rel@@ ie@@ ver right @-@ handed man A.@@ J.@@ A@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; with Hughes , he came to three hits with six hits and a walk with four Stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
comment : tiger R@@ HP A@@ ni@@ bal Sán@@ chez was eliminated because of a violation of worm training .
&quot; he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of Sanchez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; Sanchez , from mid @-@ August on the ground list because of a shoulder strap , should be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with the game of Sanchez , L@@ HP Daniel Morris is kn@@ itted by the candidate list to fight against T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July .
he has been spotted since 20 August because of a dist@@ ortion of the wr@@ ist of the wr@@ ist .
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will end their series of three games at the Target Field on Wednesday

German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CDU ) and her Austrian colleague Werner Fay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week in cooperation with several other EU leaders .
Germany started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU states so far did not have to agree on a joint action in the crisis .
the EU interior ministers want to take on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) to take a new call for binding and another 120 000 refugees .

&quot; in cooperation with the countries of Man@@ age , the Con@@ federation announced that Merkel has held nearly four hours of deliber@@ ations with the prime minister &apos;s office at the Kanz@@ ler@@ amt in Berlin on Tuesday night . &quot;

that close researchers from observations of the space probe &quot; Cas@@ sin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; according to the fact , the moon moved lightly on its rail@@ ways around the ring . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small , but still too large for a huge cel@@ est@@ ial member , it is said in a statement of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers expos@@ es their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; specialist .

&quot; when you purchase , Mang@@ os should not be too soft or firmly to smell . &quot;
the form@@ work color alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is - so green Mang@@ os can taste delicious .
they should lie down at room temperature and be consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , naturally , they sav@@ our pure or sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a Mango is also a special note , too . &quot;
it mil@@ ates the slightly bitter taste man@@ qui@@ ver like Chic@@ ore@@ e and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Mang@@ och@@ rom@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and wild animals . &quot;

Hammer Artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ n@@ enk@@ rone is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Old made for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible that now appeared with magnificent pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , the picture was form@@ ulated for Ot@@ mar contr@@ alto , who form@@ ulates his very personal inter@@ pret@@ ations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - but by no means much identical with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , adapted to the respective topics , which can be quite dark . &quot;
about three years he worked on his bi@@ ble project for which he made a sub@@ jective artistic selection from the many topics of the &quot; book of all books . &quot;
&quot; cycles have evolved who dev@@ ote issues like crosses , pl@@ agues , commandments , or fathers &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he also fascin@@ ated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological alignment as well as the Kettler Publishing House , with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and here , especially the author is Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who set himself on the basis of painting with the particular scripture . &quot;
he has interpreted by the Ot@@ mar Old Bible and thus today translated into current cont@@ ex@@ ts . &quot;
these texts are as verb@@ al mirror of Al@@ ert painting .
&quot; embedded between the original Bible quote by Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who form@@ ulates his personal thoughts on the question here . &quot;
the je@@ wel has a golden cou@@ sins .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old allows for twice a deep insight into his soul and his emotions .
this is a high level of in@@ tim@@ acy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , who was born in W@@ ern@@ ig@@ er@@ ode and grew up in Berlin in 1940 , comes from a family belonging to the strict ruler of the Order . &quot;
&quot; as an up@@ bringing happened with the pi@@ pe@@ vine , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt remembers . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work up to work , perhaps again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
his second concerns was to help the art in a quick@@ est time : &quot; the perception of image worlds is influenced today by advertising and it is no@@ isy .
symbol@@ ism is being margin@@ alized .
artist have a different desire and delight to show things .
pictures have always been a bit mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Old wants to allow the viewer to &quot; sit down &quot; into the pictures , discovering and feel what power they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for his counter@@ part . &quot;
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost began on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation to be &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert Art : &quot; I like he can compreh@@ end with his images .
&quot; I didn &apos;t care about capture the Bible completely , but also selected the mystery to him . &quot;
&quot; this was no cooperation at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text explains only . &quot; it was a picture of the Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ hler , Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to deep@@ en and find his life . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Images speak for Mö@@ hler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and screen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung . &quot;
construction start for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn ( BM@@ X railway )
&quot; plans made , place found , companies assigned to model ground floor for a circuit : one year later , almost everything was ready - yet again before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished . &quot;
&quot; fail@@ ures in politics and administration looked back , especially with the inhabitants that did not toler@@ ate the rails . &quot;
&quot; so , rolling hills moved , new place - now with formal planning and application for building permit . &quot;
&quot; the permission to enter in October , however , was able to inform the First Commun@@ i@@ in Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bock from the Children &apos;s Youth Committee now . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
it should be started without &quot; other memorial @-@ break &quot; with the work at the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B intensi@@ fied commitment for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B is expanding its commitment to refugees from 2019 , in the Bundesliga , a significant mark on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the situation in Germany and sec@@ ures policy with the help of increasing problems .
&quot; I think that for the biggest challenge of our country , since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that doesn &apos;t show me , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must always be interested in getting this topic in the grip , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Nier@@ s@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel , on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to revi@@ ve the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ell@@ ery and meet there the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ lu and the ch@@ anc@@ ellor . &quot;
&quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football can help and wants to help .
but the decisive points must be put into politics .
&quot; therefore , the German football league , therefore , has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; with the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us @-@ Brown Foundation , we ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained ren@@ s@@ bach on the outskirts of the UEFA EURO in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Federal Forces support this program .
on this weekend the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ bre@@ l will set a clear signal when it will be used for the left tri@@ cot microphone ( Hermes ) the re@@ print &quot; We will help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone can help , where and how they can only &quot; , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen sporting director Rud@@ i Völ@@ ler wrote the &quot; Image &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self conception . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama does not affect everyone , nobody &apos;s allowed to see . &quot;
&quot; we can use football team , no , we must use our jet power to help our influence and our ways to help the many refugees trying to have so incredibly suffered to help , &quot; said Her@@ tha Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale on Friday . &quot;
Nier@@ s@@ bach called the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal plant in German football . &quot;
&quot; that all 36 license companies started off their own projects , be great . &quot;
&quot; equally , is that small and smallest clubs are active . &quot;
&quot; 1 : 0 message for a welcome , &quot; which we have spent , will live in football . &quot;
&quot; that is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Association will be presenting 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees in cooperation with the DF@@ B selection and the Federal Government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the entire sum for 2015 , &quot; says Ren@@ s@@ bach . &quot;

&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to run the software group . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , fully in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the United States , but since the summer time he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
&quot; it is important to stand up again , if you please . &quot;
McLaren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ ussen except skir@@ m@@ ish ...
Magn@@ ussen was t@@ wit@@ ched a photograph and explained that he had suffered from the wheel when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; as a result , he will therefore also take a little as reserve to the two main pilots Fernando Alonso and J@@ enson Button , as one week later in the Great Prize of Japan . &quot;
&quot; football : Bv@@ C , without Re@@ us vs. Kras@@ no@@ dar , &quot;
at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group of group in Europe must finally be crushed . &quot;
&quot; the national player is also missing the table leader of the soccer league in the du@@ el with the FK Kras@@ no@@ dar , Thursday ( 7 : 00 / Sky ) . &quot;
&quot; but we cannot go back on him , &quot; &quot; Thomas Tu@@ chel said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; if Re@@ us will be back in the Bundesliga match on Sunday in the Bundesliga match , the B@@ V@@ B coach left : &quot; we anticip@@ ate a return of him to the training session on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ cker will not only change his trunk to the Re@@ us position . &quot;
thus he announced a change to the tor@@ rent position .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of art@@ ender Roman Bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; praised the football player to the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller is used in the future in all Europa League games , Tu@@ cker is however open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he is also competing with the second game . &quot;
&quot; the resear@@ ching statement by Mit@@ er Re@@ us , that the final statement for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League has to be the goal , keeps the mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for re@@ tra@@ geous : &quot; it &apos;s not that bad that Marco was not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to access the title .
robot cars : government wants to become a pioneer for Germany
&quot; according to the will of the federal government , Germany will be on the change of the vehicle technology . &quot;
the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday made a strategy paper from the house of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure .
Do@@ brin@@ dt was said on Wednesday at the ver@@ ge of the Autom@@ esse Fair at a &quot; new mobile Age . &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase transport security and provide less traffic , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also plans to discuss the topic with his counter@@ parts from the G7 states , including representatives of the industry . &quot;
the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises among other things the meaning of the mobile broadband expansion and a generous mig@@ rating to digital radio stations .
&quot; for testing new technology , a test ride on the motorway is 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; so that the driver has no additional liability risk to be born , &quot; the German government wants to examine the legal framework conditions &quot; and , where necessary , to adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany is aiming to use approximately international investments that the maximum permissible speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government also aims to deplo@@ y the Convention for a change in the Vienna Convention , which only sees human beings as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in increasing drive , driving the car in increasing the car , the driver gets more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is mainly based on sensors and cameras that process the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; following a survey conducted by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , automated driving on motor@@ ways will be technically feasi@@ ble by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , road @-@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected to come up far after 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the value added value in the area of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functions at location Germany estimate the authors of the study by 2025 , approximately 8.4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; digital networking of the car can lead to more safety and efficiency in traffic , &quot; says the SPD traffic sp@@ ol@@ ition@@ ist S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; the question of liability for accidents and security of the personal data of the drivers , however , must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
yet the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still sk@@ ep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a result , on Wednesday , on the AA survey of the research institute of the DE@@ K@@ RA , the result is that only eight percent of Germans think that autonomous cars will continue to prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent should not believe in 20 years or 31 per cent at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those surveyed by 2025 with aut@@ on@@ ous passenger cars , in the US 33 per cent . &quot;
drivers in Germany are still not ready to rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle .
&quot; after a survey of the digital inter@@ change month , only seven percent would agree that control during the entire ride on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at the highway we could imagine only 15 percent in the flowing transport , in stag@@ nation 45 percent . &quot;
&quot; well , everyone would leave control under no circumstances any circumstances . &quot;

&quot; according to the event , Düsseldorf plans to take action on the single message from September 25 to October 4 only . &quot;
the final decision should be dropped by September 22 at the latest .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; we are strong enough , even without Timo the title , &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf , Germany . &quot;
B@@ oll was located at this time on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed Spon@@ sor@@ guarantee in China .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .

&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves , &quot; stated the World R@@ ank@@ ings . &quot;

Gaul@@ tier is getting too old for a en@@ cap@@ tiv@@ al approach
it &apos;s a mix of quite large fashion show and a wax figures Gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gaul@@ tier ( 63 ) presented a show on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window ne@@ qu@@ ins that look terrible to video projec@@ tions made by video projec@@ tions .
&quot; they bear the spectacular cre@@ ations of the French designer , amongst others , with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage @-@ out@@ fits to the big star of the fashion scene - and that he was males in skirts . &quot;
I can &apos;t say any more that I am the en@@ f@@ ant @-@ Haute C@@ out@@ ure because I have white hair .
&quot; previously it was ble@@ ached , &quot; Gaul@@ tier says . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the pav@@ ement to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen from 18th of September at the Kuns@@ thalle in Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer re@@ jects his attitude concerning his person . &quot;
&quot; he actually was , because &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; he said . &quot;
when you die comes to the museum .
&quot; the impressive collection had previously made in Montreal and in Paris , Canada . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s a lot more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits indicate an insight into which barely visible work of the man who has written fashion history without ever completed an apprentices@@ hip .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an outstanding chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which much effort was done : to fr@@ ying the d@@ olls , an styl@@ ist was hired as an example . &quot;
14 tons of material have lost the makers according to the Cur@@ ators Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
&quot; just before the October launch of the Oktober@@ fest , there was another special treat : a leather out@@ fit with cork . &quot;
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he &apos;s always interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , Gaul@@ tier says . &quot;
Gaul@@ ti@@ ers @-@ Teddy Award is also shown in the exhibition .
he stands for the first half @-@ term fashionable walking distance of the designer .
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and po@@ or@@ ly in the football ) , he said to his Teddy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gaul@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; with a doll to play , his parents would not have permitted him . &quot;
the dis@@ card of fashion it brought itself later by itself .
&quot; he st@@ ats fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers , like Gaul@@ tier in Munich . &quot;
later I bought that of course .
&quot; for his first look , he did not pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but was allowed to place the clothes . &quot;
jewelry instead of Gar@@ dine - Pl@@ ate Top as fashion @-@ niche
&quot; in former times , it went to the long embroi@@ dery and to make pl@@ ying about it . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were developed in large amounts of customers , for example , including blank@@ ets and gar@@ d@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , Andreas Rein@@ hardt explains its managing director of the lead @-@ board plots . &quot;
instead the fashion is important again .
in the early hours of Pl@@ au@@ ric lace fashion plays a major role in terms of its home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche .
Rein@@ hardt is some examples : lace top in jewelry , for accessories such as bags and with regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion which leans on past stal@@ ks , an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who are not operated in the textile branch in Germany is no longer available on the market .
&quot; with us , they are already making half of all jobs . &quot;
Mo@@ j@@ okes Pl@@ auen is with nine further companies member of the industry association Pl@@ ain tip and embroi@@ der@@ ies .
only they may bear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , approximately 80 percent of its sales were broken . &quot;
private specialist shops and wholesale outlets are almost no longer available .
the customers show our products on this way .
&quot; in the Asian region , the mass y@@ ware is much cheaper , and almost exclusively distributed over chains . &quot;
&quot; also fe@@ eb@@ le export , currently after Russia and in the United States . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also attempts to focus through environmental awareness such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer from the embroi@@ per@@ stone in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since this year , we have a quality seal , which shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and soci@@ ally . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt added : &quot; this also refers to the materials used . &quot;
Ute Schmidt teaches at the Schnee@@ berger holding company of the University of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized on embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to compl@@ ain the competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; a voltage panel is created between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and the factories , which have to think particularly economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a existing design often is only slightly different to hold a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago animated textile designer Kat@@ i Re@@ uter was new , the historical snow shi@@ fter . &quot;
this raises the machine attached to some places little ch@@ icks .
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ric Gold@@ smith master@@ head of Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach K@@ rau@@ kes inspired him to inspire him : &quot; before , I couldn &apos;t begin with traditional pl@@ au@@ sts . &quot;
now they use the snow @-@ pointed tip for their jewelry .
&quot; in a sin@@ uous method , it shaped the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify themselves with the theme pl@@ au@@ ght - young and old , &quot; says Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies us to the United States , Australia and Finland - mainly to customers who have lived in Pl@@ auen and Sur@@ ro@@ undings , and like a mem@@ ento . &quot;
that I see my ornam@@ ents as the modern ambassador of the Pl@@ ush .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy bro@@ ader for the world
&quot; the economy must gradually open towards the outside , to promote growth , said President X@@ i Jin@@ ping on Tuesday a group that was commissioned to reform the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should attract themselves to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategies for business decisions , &quot; &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for deep@@ ening a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; developing new start and comm@@ ence reforms will bring new vibration and vitality , offering new opportunities for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the leading group has adopted a number of policies including a neg@@ ativity @-@ list for making access to market access , relaxation of the governmental system ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ h@@ aul of the population . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative result is created , the sectors and companies identified , which will not enter into question . &quot;
the system is tested and tested according to test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it indicates the market a major role in the allocation of resources to the right @-@ state business environment , and designed the market . &quot;
&quot; the government will ease controls over those transmitted to the companies , and make sure businesses make their business transactions . &quot;
the statement also said that China will allow critical areas to explore new models of trans@@ boundary economic sl@@ ump and new mechanisms for promoting regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors will open , additional areas are opened to private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the righ@@ t@@ ful interests of foreign @-@ financed companies and bring better services to them , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier made for foreigners , to apply a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; by facil@@ it@@ ating the requirements and application process . &quot;
&quot; the right of attor@@ neys to ass@@ ure their activity , and to use professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , were also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; the meeting held also Prime Minister Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leader as Liu Yun@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli , as reported in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limits in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish
&quot; the European Commission aims to double the limit values for mercury in big pre@@ dat@@ ory fishes , thereby resulting in a significantly higher dose of vol@@ ous@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the consumer organization F@@ ood@@ watch , who is a profession of the EU based paper , critic@@ ised the plans for : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy , &quot; Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ midt by F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ midt says the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ - or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish from &quot; economic policy reasons &quot; can be raised from one on two milli@@ grams of mercury per kilogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large car@@ ess@@ ors are already so strongly bur@@ dened by mercury , that on the basis of applicable limit values , about 50 percent of the length cannot be sold . &quot;
&quot; upon dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ compens@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; in return for this attra@@ ct@@ ant , the EU according F@@ ood@@ watch wants to reduce the limit values at other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0,1 milli@@ gram of mercury per kilogram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch , however , called this as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller dr@@ y@@ fish , such as car@@ p usually were so low because they already have the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the decrease in plain states is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ des de@@ fle@@ ction principle , which helps only the economy alone , &quot; said Wolf@@ sch@@ midt . &quot;
mercury is a high @-@ level heavy metal that is enriched over the food chain especially in pre@@ dat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the federal government is therefore warning that &quot; &quot; low amounts especially may cause low @-@ born damage in the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry announced on its homepage , with regard to relevant limits , however , that an &quot; health haz@@ ards of the general population &quot; is not expected . &quot;
mercury reaches the environment mainly through the coal combustion .
&quot; according to a written information by the German Federal Ministry of Health , Ann@@ al@@ ena Ba@@ er@@ corn introduced more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total population em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fishing some in El@@ be , Rhine and Danube should be &quot; permanent and nationwide &quot; , &quot; Spiegel had quoted the paper in March of the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , mercury &apos;s wide war@@ nings made from mercury in fish already reported to the most common health risks in the EU warning system R@@ AS@@ FF . &quot;
