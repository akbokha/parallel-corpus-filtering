the purpose of this part of the Convention is to be defined in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures as required .
&quot; the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the down@@ turn significant material material for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons and other core compounds for un@@ familiar purpose , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a breakdown by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; in Article 28 fixed objectives , the material book@@ keeping is fundamental as a backup of basic importance , inter@@ connec@@ t@@ edness with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as essential supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is performed by an explanation , in which for each material image , which is specified for a specific period of time im@@ balances of material limits for the given Me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization makes for Article 3 full use of the safety system of the Community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material image .
&quot; when using their backup measures , the community of de @-@ procedures and measures will make use of the following manner and make them as far as required , fores@@ try to be closer and expe@@ dient in supple@@ mentary instructions : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preser@@ v@@ ative , built @-@ out , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of the stock material and the volumes ; &quot;
B ) assessing the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the estim@@ ation of the measurement certainty ;
C ) method of identification and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which consisted of the core material and the changes of this inventory , including the one - and outputs of the material image ; &quot;
G ) precautions that make sure the accounting procedures and conventions are correctly carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for the refund of reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures after this Convention will not extend to material in the mining industry or in the se@@ duc@@ al treatment .
&quot; B ) is the pri@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ander material that has not yet reached the core fuel circulation , in the states introduced , so the community of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ en@@ rich@@ ment in which it is made , or becomes the core material or else , in a later stage of the nuclear cycle of the core material introduced into the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures envisaged in this Convention are not authorized for core material , but the community believes that the back@@ casting of core material , the backup measures after this Convention is not possible or desired , so call the organization and community to each other on the application of appropriate backup measures . &quot;
B ) The backup measures envisaged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 provided that the organization and the community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ profit .
on request of the community the organization releases the following core material from the backup measures after this Convention :
a ) special sp@@ out material when used in grams - or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material when it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 in case such core material is re@@ plac@@ eable and
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an Is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is about 80 % . &quot;
&quot; on request of the community liber@@ ates the organization of core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures after this Convention , from these backup measures , provided that the entire , due to this article in the states of liber@@ ated core material are at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of 1 kilograms of particular p@@ liable material that consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with the en@@ rich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; III ) Ur@@ an with a rich@@ ment that lies under 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above the nature of nature , calculated by multi@@ plying its weight with the fi@@ erc@@ er square of the en@@ rich@@ ment ; &quot;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of Natur@@ a and de@@ ple@@ ted pri@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons de@@ ple@@ ted pri@@ an with an en@@ rich@@ ment of 0.@@ 00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or including ;

&quot; the organization on the basis of the initial report is summ@@ arized in Article 62 of the initial report of the entire , the backup measures of the present Convention in the states , irrespective of its origin , and results from the subsequent reports and the results of their veri@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its member states Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Italy , Italy , Italy , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) . &quot;
&quot; in ER@@ WA@@ EG@@ ER NA@@ CH@@ STE@@ H@@ EN@@ DER GR@@ √ú@@ N@@ DE - a ) The EEC has decided to help him to the conference on international economic cooperation established , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is hin@@ dered by general resili@@ ence problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and the Member States that the entire agreement is bound to force within six months after the agreement comes into force of loan , and the organization will do its possible to make it possible to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the organization have cons@@ ented to each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bin@@ dings to ensure broad and balanced geographic distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC has presented a table which is clearly structured , in what manner in which they are intended to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization is intended to establish a special account under the term &quot; special transaction &quot; , &quot; which is derived from the funds under this agreement ; this account is designated by the organization as administrator ( in this property ) , and only to the purpose stated in this agreement and according to the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction is presented separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) The payment is made in the form of cash or in@@ trin@@ sic deb@@ tor of the member state , who are to pay on demand in the currency of the particular state at order of the organisation as administrative of the event , and to deposit at the rear of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two instal@@ ments , namely the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the entry in 30 days of the agreement or the other between the EEC and the administrator at the agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second amount of the remainder of the paper on 1 January 1979 or at a different time , agreed between the EEC and the ste@@ ward , taking into account the deadlines necessary for parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
C ) Every@@ one Member State can afford the payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker acts according to the usual procedures of the organization , about the cash or the shoulder campaign , in order to cover expenses for the special deadline and to equi@@ p the special event in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; upon the granting of this loan , the administrator is guided by the following factors in accordance with the terms of the EEC : &quot;
&quot; III ) to the extent , in which international economic factors have contributed to the current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems of the country ; &quot;
&quot; VI ) the composition and the tendency of debt service of the country and its subsequent lending capacity , without remuner@@ ation ; and &quot;
VII ) to the extent that the problems of the concerned countries can regulate from other sources .

&quot; the funds of special accounts must not be used instead of a substitute of the International Bank for Re@@ construction and Development ( Bank ) , or the Organisation for a program or project , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special deadline is subject to the same withdrawal conditions , which apply for the organization granted in general ; they are therefore refundable at 10 free @-@ years each in 50 years . &quot;
special deadline is granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are refundable in these currencies .
amounts to pay for these bones are directly to the organization they retains .
&quot; each special deadline is provided by a separate loan agreement between the recei@@ vers and the car@@ et@@ akers , in which the origin of the means is specified . &quot;
&quot; the income from any special transaction can be used for expenses in the currency of the beneficiaries , or for goods or services , which are manufactured in developing countries ; ii ) in developing countries that have established members of the Organization and which the administrator has to become the recipient of a special transaction . &quot;
&quot; payment payments of special deadline can be carried out at the special event , and the amount paid in the currency of a Member State will be returned as soon as possible by the administrator to the member states concerned . &quot;
the administrator has taught up to the complete award of all special deadline for the EEC via the directors in preparation and on the projects approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payout of the special deadline , the administrator is instruc@@ ted to receive the EEC quarterly reports on the development of the special deadline and the expenses related to this . &quot;
the administrator is transmitted to the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organization with an opinion of the external billing examination of the organization on this account .
&quot; after full payout of the special deadline , the administrator transmitted the EEC as soon as possible a detailed account of the transaction tax and programmes , as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and billing , from which the contributions to the special deadline , resulting from the account received from the account amount and the withdraw@@ als presented to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ el@@ ter of up to the complete edition of the Special Global accounts , the continuation of the financial transaction , funded programs or projects , and on any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; it is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organization should be agreed , not in force , so the agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; the total amount of capital will be re@@ funded according to Article II section 8 of this agreement and re@@ funded to Member States , the agreement and all claims of the parties with immediate effect are termin@@ ated . &quot;
this agreement requires permission by the individual member states and the EEC as in accordance with the legal provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States specify the conclusion of the Council of the European Communities to the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Secret@@ ariat led these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication of the legal approval of this agreement through the EEC .
&quot; this agreement will be effective and effective in force on the first day of the month , which follows the receipt of the aforementioned noti@@ fications in the organization . &quot;

in the form of a stamp between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on Trade in H@@ amm@@ el and H@@ amm@@ ums
&quot; I honour me , on the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community related to the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat by the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flawless operation of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the fact that the amount consumed is not sur@@ passed and executed in accordance with conventional package forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , so consult the two parties of this agreement with each other before the introduction of such a change in the under number 10 to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community is entitled to the guardian clause , it is obliged to bear in mind that the access to Argentina &apos;s shared access to the common market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that they exceed the agreed quantities from Argentina to a year , the Community reserves the right to put them from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to access the products produced from this agreement to a high set of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
&quot; entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed set , according to the extent of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this context , the value of the added tax was carried out under the number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the amount , under number 2 , will be determined by the day of Greek accession to the community to 23 000 tonnes of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ in@@ ean H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs on the Community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precautions , so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ ine lam@@ b@@ ans - and l@@ ame meat are not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of accum@@ ul@@ ings or other support measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions , which are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community trading with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are shown in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 ( c c ) of the Convention on the design and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General inch and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular that within this agreement , we have given a fixed amount of export license to the products stated below number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to take all necessary precautions to make all necessary precautions , so that the distribution of import license for the above @-@ mentioned products is made in Argentina by the submission of a export license , given by the responsible position of the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system will be defined so that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the disposable products can be avoided .
&quot; in force @-@ regulations , it is also specified that the competent authorities of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals will be given in regular intervals to en@@ code the export license . if necessary , these details are necessary to en@@ code . &quot;
the committee bears concern that the agreement is properly applied and working smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the terms of sales in these markets , including conditions , which are of importance for those under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee bears concern that proper application of this agreement will not be affected by this , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat should not be carried out under the agreement named collective numbers according to the Community . &quot;
the Committee considers all questions concerning the implementation of this agreement and recommends the appropriate regulatory authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply un@@ obstruc@@ ted to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
number 2 of the annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount paid by force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year will be determined in proportion to the total of the total , and bears the seasonal character of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and upon the other hand the Treaty establishing the Republic of Argentina on the other hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 . March 1984 ; after that point , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to cancel it with a notice period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider to be understandable . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government for this purpose .

&quot; blood c@@ ess@@ ation is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ding through a closed , steri@@ le tube system into a steri@@ le bottle , in which the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose solution was absorbed in front of the steri@@ lization . &quot;
&quot; after completion of blood c@@ ess@@ ation , the bottle is immediately shut down and cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it should only be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; however , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution can not be more than 220 ml per liter of human full blood , and the hem@@ ost@@ asis con@@ centric may not be subject to 97 g per liter . &quot;

&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human blood bloody , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all the red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been won ; other blood cells may be present or may be partially removed . &quot;
the liquid salary of the concentration camp consists either from the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic pri@@ zed solution that has been assigned to the removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to amount between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the y@@ thro@@ cy@@ stic volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) on the label . &quot;

&quot; to switch the detrimental effects of bacterial products in plasma , bleeding will not be used , the signs of bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to decrease the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ al@@ atitis , are to decrease the risk of transmission distr@@ actions that do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods of applying this danger in comparable ways . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of plasma , corresponding water supply is zu@@ b@@ ble ; the substance must be completely solved within 10 minutes by 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum plasma is dissolved in water @-@ quantities , that of the liquid quantity , from which it has been manufactured , the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) one puts 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of th@@ ro@@ mb@@ one or calcium chl@@ oride , thus takes place , the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ @-@ stage drying process in the presence of Ph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine , under a pressure of maximum 0.@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , the human dry @-@ weight loss may not occur at 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dr@@ plasma is located in a nit@@ rogen atmosphere , or in an air @-@ empty space in a steri@@ le , sealed bottle , under pay@@ roll of any micro @-@ organisms and according to any possibility of any moisture ; it is protected from light and to keep on a temperature under 20 C . &quot;
&quot; human Alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from the human plasma systems are preparations made from the protein component , consisting of approximately 60 % of the total mass @-@ mass @-@ mass of the human full blu@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether the end product should be fluid or dry , the supplement has to be heated after an appropriate stabili@@ zers in the final container for 10 hours on 60 C ¬± 0.5 C in order to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ el@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in preparations from the Menshevi@@ ki album , at least 95 % of the sizes of the existing proteins have to be considered . &quot;

&quot; parties commit themselves to re@@ agents , re@@ agents to re@@ charge the costs of their extraction , preparation and transport as well as if necessary the purchase price of other contract parties , who need to be urgently needed , provided that they themselves have adequate supplies for their own needs . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood group@@ ing are made available only under the condition that no profit is associated with it , that they may only be used for medical purposes and only delivered by the governments involved . &quot;
each shipment of re@@ agents to blood @-@ determination is a certificate in order that they were produced according to the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its plant represent a administrative agreement which can be amended or supple@@ mented by the governments of the contract parties .
parties make all the necessary measures to deliver the re@@ agents provided to them from other contractual parties to the blood @-@ determination of all the input data .
&quot; they also meet all necessary measures to make sure these substances in Article 3 marked recei@@ vers quickly and on the shortest way . &quot;
&quot; the contract parties provide each other with the Secretary General of the Council of Europe , a list of jobs intended for issuing the certification in Article 4 of the Council of Europe . &quot;
these jobs should be identical in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
the Convention is for the Members of the Council of Europe on the signing ; they can be a party by signing it to a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval .

&quot; a re@@ agen@@ z to the blood @-@ determination must react with all tested blood samples that contain an@@ tigen , that is the anti@@ body or any other on the substance stated in the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agen@@ z is used in the manufacturer recommended by the manufacturer , the following factors or appearances may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ ol@@ y@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the title is measured by an ever re @-@ di@@ lution of the re@@ boot re@@ agen@@ das of the double in a suitable medium .
the title is the recipro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively by the volume of blood cells in the total volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents , which are to be used on object toler@@ ances , the activity is expressed through time , which is required for a ag@@ glut@@ ination on a property carrier . &quot;
the World Health Organization has set up for anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D Re@@ agen@@ cia to the blood @-@ determination of International norms and designed for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity .
&quot; according to definition , a internation@@ alist standard includes a certain number of inter@@ national units per mg / ml , and this definition is independent from the Tit@@ ans which can be observed in individual preparations ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for the re@@ group@@ ing of most speci@@ si@@ ties is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ ist , which is observed in a series of th@@ war@@ ting in a er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tic spl@@ itting . &quot;
the title gives the di@@ lution of the re@@ agen@@ das in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood @-@ determination , available for the International Standard Pre@@ par@@ ations ( at the time Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete Anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the in@@ filtration of un@@ familiar re@@ agents in comparison to the International Standard policy or state standard in accordance with International Standards ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agen@@ z is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties should remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agen@@ ic form according to label is at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the resulting exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is targeted after the results of the shelf ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ treated gas or in a vacuum , in which they are dried and that is closed so that no moisture can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agen@@ z must lose maximum 0,5 v.@@ H. its weight if it is tested by further drying via Ph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
&quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the Re@@ agen@@ z ( or the supplied sol@@ o@@ cular and / or antibiotic ) is added , provided that the re@@ agen@@ z with the added substance remains the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;
&quot; sera human origin for blood @-@ determination must contain at least 2.5 mg o@@ white @-@ nit@@ rogen per m@@ l. , liquid or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents , in@@ different , whether in flu@@ ence form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and may not contain any sedi@@ mentation nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood @-@ determination should not be colored as arti@@ fici@@ ally as long as possible , at least until the International Convention has come about a uniform system . &quot;
&quot; re@@ agents for blood types are to be distributed in such a way , and in such quantities , that the re@@ agents are not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells , but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control cells . &quot;
the quantity that occur in a container must be so great that the content may be used to carry out the tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing of manufacturing has to lead over all stages of production and controls of re@@ agents for blood group@@ ing written records .
&quot; adequate samples of all entered re@@ agents are so long to retain from the laboratory , until some likelihood is assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood types may contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective percentage , the others are the necessary means to reinforce the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agen@@ das . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective application in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents are unable to contain any substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; placed on each single tank is a black and white label in English and French , including the following information : 1 . name and ad@@ ress of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; the subsidies associated with the goods between the parties are authorised by means of a single paper , to use the prints , according to the prints , according to the pattern in Annex I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the unanim@@ ity is used in case of registration or paper for export , shipping procedures , or for import . &quot;
&quot; - to be explicitly demanded by the legislation applicable by the legislation , whose use would not be guaranteed at all the use of the unanim@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; - to be demanded by the participants , so that they may be able to apply for a proposal or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement does not prevent the contractual parties , simplified methods , even using data processing , with regard to additional facilities for the parties involved . &quot;
( 2 ) simplified procedures can in particular fores@@ ee that the concerned goods are not present at a customs office and to present the registration for these goods not the customs post ; furthermore the delivery of an incomplete registration may be approved .
&quot; in these cases , an application must be dealt with , in which it is possible to act with the approval of the competent authorities for the perio@@ dical collective registration deadline . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; I allow myself to propose the following agreement which will serve as a basis for co @-@ operation between the European Economic Community and the International Council for Sea Research . &quot;
&quot; 1 . the European Economic Community , represented by its Commission , is listed in the &quot; &quot; Commission &quot; , &quot; in order to ask recommendations concerning the management of fish stocks and related questions , and the Council will come as much as possible to this request . &quot;
&quot; 2 . given the Commission &apos;s responsibility in matters relating to the management of fish stocks , the Council agreed to submit all the relevant reports of its work@@ groups to assess the situation as well as the reports of its Advisory Board . &quot;
&quot; 3 . the Council and the Commission are advised to intensify the cooperation between the two parties , and in particular the possibilities of examining which the Commission agreed to establish a closer link to the Advisory Board &apos;s Advisory Board . &quot;

&quot; THE EV@@ ER@@ WA@@ Y , that it is desirable that the International Convention entered into force on 14 June 1983 in Brussels on the harmon@@ ized system for designation and co@@ ding of the goods on January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE ER@@ WA@@ Y , that without a change in Article 13 of the stated Convention shall continue to remain uncertain - the time of the adoption of this Convention will remain in@@ secure - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of June 14 , 1983 in Brussels closed the International Convention on the Com@@ prehen@@ sible System for designation and Co@@ ding of the goods , in the following &quot; Convention , &quot; will receive paragraph 1 of the following version : &quot;

&quot; - a plant is essential not only for entertainment and conservation of so@@ ils , but also the exploitation of land that does not allow other planting , which constitutes the main part of today &apos;s production , is favourable to any improvement of cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS that depend on its cultivation the existence and the living standards of millions of families , which are in turn fully dependent on measures that are to maintain and increase the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the not generated consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that olive oil and Taf@@ el@@ oli@@ ven are essential in the areas , in which the olive @-@ building is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the essential characteristic of the olive production is the in@@ vari@@ ance of the harv@@ ests and market supply , and that this leads to fluctu@@ ations of production , prices and export holes as well as at very different levels of income ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that all causes particular difficulties , which threaten the interests of producers and consumers seriously and end@@ anger the general policy of economic growth in the countries that are common in zones where the olive oil is common ; &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS AU@@ F the extraordinary importance that the olive production for the economy of numerous countries , particularly the cultivation of olive cultivation , is coming ; &quot;
