the purpose of this part of the Convention is to be defined in the implementation of the provisions of the part I on securing measures as required .
&quot; the aim of the procedures laid down in this Convention is the timely discovery of the down@@ turn significant material material for the manufacturing of nuclear weapons and other core compounds for un@@ familiar purpose , as well as the deter@@ rent of such a breakdown by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; in Article 28 fixed objectives , the material book@@ keeping is fundamental as a backup of basic importance , inter@@ connec@@ t@@ edness with the spatial de@@ mar@@ cation and observation as essential supple@@ mental measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the veri@@ fications by the organization is performed by an explanation , in which for each material image , which is specified for a specific period of time im@@ balances of material limits for the given Me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organization makes for Article 3 full use of the safety system of the Community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material according to this Convention is based on an outline in material image .
&quot; when using their backup measures , the community of de @-@ procedures and measures will make use of the following manner and make them as far as required , fores@@ try to be closer and expe@@ dient in supple@@ mentary instructions : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system to determine the amounts of preser@@ v@@ ative , built @-@ out , lost , lost , or otherwise from the stock of the stock material and the volumes ; &quot;
B ) assessing the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the estim@@ ation of the measurement certainty ;
C ) method of identification and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol - and reporting system , which consisted of the core material and the changes of this inventory , including the one - and outputs of the material image ; &quot;
G ) precautions that make sure the accounting procedures and conventions are correctly carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for the refund of reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures after this Convention will not extend to material in the mining industry or in the se@@ duc@@ al treatment .
&quot; B ) is the pri@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ ander material that has not yet reached the core fuel circulation , in the states introduced , so the community of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is implemented for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ open@@ en@@ rich@@ ment in which it is made , or becomes the core material or else , in a later stage of the nuclear cycle of the core material introduced into the states , so it is subject to the others in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The security measures envisaged in this Convention are not authorized for core material , but the community believes that the back@@ casting of core material , the backup measures after this Convention is not possible or desired , so call the organization and community to each other on the application of appropriate backup measures . &quot;
B ) The backup measures envisaged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 provided that the organization and the community notice that this core material is practically non @-@ profit .
on request of the community the organization releases the following core material from the backup measures after this Convention :
a ) special sp@@ out material when used in grams - or smaller amounts than sensor in instruments ;
B ) core material when it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 in case such core material is re@@ plac@@ eable and
&quot; C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an Is@@ ot@@ open@@ con@@ centric of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is about 80 % . &quot;

&quot; payment payments of special deadline can be carried out at the special event , and the amount paid in the currency of a Member State will be returned as soon as possible by the administrator to the member states concerned . &quot;
the administrator has taught up to the complete award of all special deadline for the EEC via the directors in preparation and on the projects approved by the directors .
&quot; during the period of payout of the special deadline , the administrator is instruc@@ ted to receive the EEC quarterly reports on the development of the special deadline and the expenses related to this . &quot;
the administrator is transmitted to the EEC as soon as possible after the conclusion of the financial year of the organization with an opinion of the external billing examination of the organization on this account .
&quot; after full payout of the special deadline , the administrator transmitted the EEC as soon as possible a detailed account of the transaction tax and programmes , as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and billing , from which the contributions to the special deadline , resulting from the account received from the account amount and the withdraw@@ als presented to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the goals of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the ste@@ el@@ ter of up to the complete edition of the Special Global accounts , the continuation of the financial transaction , funded programs or projects , and on any other questions that affect the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; it is this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date that the EEC and the organization should be agreed , not in force , so the agreement and all of the resulting obligations of the parties are due to immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; the total amount of capital will be re@@ funded according to Article II section 8 of this agreement and re@@ funded to Member States , the agreement and all claims of the parties with immediate effect are termin@@ ated . &quot;

in the form of a stamp between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ inian Republic on Trade in H@@ amm@@ el and H@@ amm@@ ums
&quot; I honour me , on the recent negotiations between our delegations to establish provisions on imports of H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community related to the application of the Common Market Organisation for sheep and goat meat by the Community . in the course of these negotiations , both parties are as follows : &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cool@@ ed H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat ( 02 01 A IV a ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export possibilities for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in battle @-@ body ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; to ensure a flawless operation of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the fact that the amount consumed is not sur@@ passed and executed in accordance with conventional package forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form as a result of changes in technology and trade are possible , so consult the two parties of this agreement with each other before the introduction of such a change in the under number 10 to find an adequate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community is entitled to the guardian clause , it is obliged to bear in mind that the access to Argentina &apos;s shared access to the common market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that they exceed the agreed quantities from Argentina to a year , the Community reserves the right to put them from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion to access the products produced from this agreement to a high set of 10 v.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em to limit .
&quot; entering new Member States , the community in consultation with Argentina changes the number 2 fixed set , according to the extent of the Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duties for these new Member States will be determined according to the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; in this context , the value of the added tax was carried out under the number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the amount , under number 2 , will be determined by the day of Greek accession to the community to 23 000 tonnes of battle @-@ weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could affect the marketing of Argent@@ in@@ ean H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs on the Community market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the community meets precautions , so that the sales of intervention stocks of frozen meat due to the implementation of the regulation of Argent@@ ine lam@@ b@@ ans - and l@@ ame meat are not under@@ mines . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and regulations of this agreement , the Community agreed that any actual application of accum@@ ul@@ ings or other support measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lam@@ bs are only at prices and conditions , which are consistent with existing international obligations and take into account the traditional proportion of community trading with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are shown in a way that is compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 ( c c ) of the Convention on the design and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General inch and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Argentina ensures compliance with this agreement in particular that within this agreement , we have given a fixed amount of export license to the products stated below number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the community is obliged to take all necessary precautions to make all necessary precautions , so that the distribution of import license for the above @-@ mentioned products is made in Argentina by the submission of a export license , given by the responsible position of the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system will be defined so that the position of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the disposable products can be avoided .
&quot; in force @-@ regulations , it is also specified that the competent authorities of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals will be given in regular intervals to en@@ code the export license . if necessary , these details are necessary to en@@ code . &quot;
the committee bears concern that the agreement is properly applied and working smoothly .
&quot; he regularly checks the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the terms of sales in these markets , including conditions , which are of importance for those under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee bears concern that proper application of this agreement will not be affected by this , that products from H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb and goat meat should not be carried out under the agreement named collective numbers according to the Community . &quot;
the Committee considers all questions concerning the implementation of this agreement and recommends the appropriate regulatory authorities .
the provisions of this agreement shall apply un@@ obstruc@@ ted to the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
number 2 of the annual amount is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount paid by force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year will be determined in proportion to the total of the total , and bears the seasonal character of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and upon the other hand the Treaty establishing the Republic of Argentina on the other hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 . March 1984 ; after that point , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to cancel it with a notice period of one year in writing . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be checked by the two parties before the 1 . April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider to be understandable . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would share the consent of your government for this purpose .
I adore myself to confirm the entrance of your current writing with the following wording :

&quot; to ensure a flawless operation of the agreement , it is obliged to secure New Zealand , by suitable methods that the fact that the actual quantity did not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ standing quantities are executed in conventional package forms ( frozen or cool@@ ed ) .

&quot; blood c@@ ess@@ ation is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ ding through a closed , steri@@ le tube system into a steri@@ le bottle , in which the anti @-@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ose solution was absorbed in front of the steri@@ lization . &quot;
&quot; after completion of blood c@@ ess@@ ation , the bottle is immediately shut down and cool down to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it should only be opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; however , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution can not be more than 220 ml per liter of human full blood , and the hem@@ ost@@ asis con@@ centric may not be subject to 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood @-@ group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 @-@ system is previously on hand of the blood cell and of the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried through examination of blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or .

&quot; human full bloody oil is protected in steri@@ le , closed bottle of micro @-@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are only permitted during the examination and transportation of necessary times , which is up to 30 minutes to cool down immediately to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
&quot; a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unity of human blood bloody , from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed . &quot;
&quot; it contains all the red blood cells of the unit , from which it has been won ; other blood cells may be present or may be partially removed . &quot;
the liquid salary of the concentration camp consists either from the remaining plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic pri@@ zed solution that has been assigned to the removal of the plasma .
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to amount between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approximate percentage of the y@@ thro@@ cy@@ stic volume ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ it ) on the label . &quot;

&quot; to switch the detrimental effects of bacterial products in plasma , bleeding will not be used , the signs of bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of every donation must be proven in a blood amount of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to decrease the risk of transfer of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation@@ al@@ atitis , are to decrease the risk of transmission distr@@ actions that do not contain more than 12 donations , or other methods of applying this danger in comparable ways . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of plasma , corresponding water supply is zu@@ b@@ ble ; the substance must be completely solved within 10 minutes by 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given Qu@@ antum plasma is dissolved in water @-@ quantities , that of the liquid quantity , from which it has been manufactured , the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; II ) one puts 1 ml solution a sufficient amount of th@@ ro@@ mb@@ one or calcium chl@@ oride , thus takes place , the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ oven at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24@@ @-@ stage drying process in the presence of Ph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine , under a pressure of maximum 0.@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , the human dry @-@ weight loss may not occur at 0.5 % . &quot;

&quot; human Alb@@ um@@ in and fac@@ tions from the human plasma systems are preparations made from the protein component , consisting of approximately 60 % of the total mass @-@ mass @-@ mass of the human full blu@@ ff . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether the end product should be fluid or dry , the supplement has to be heated after an appropriate stabili@@ zers in the final container for 10 hours on 60 C ± 0.5 C in order to in@@ activate the patho@@ gen of the I@@ no@@ kul@@ el@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; in preparations from the Menshevi@@ ki album , at least 95 % of the sizes of the existing proteins have to be considered . &quot;
&quot; in both preparations , no more than 10 mg of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin may be present per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the end product is dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agen@@ z is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties should remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agen@@ ic form according to label is at most a year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the resulting exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents is targeted after the results of the shelf ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are kept in an atmosphere of in@@ treated gas or in a vacuum , in which they are dried and that is closed so that no moisture can enter . &quot;
a dry re@@ agen@@ z must lose maximum 0,5 v.@@ H. its weight if it is tested by further drying via Ph@@ osph@@ or@@ pent@@ ine at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm H@@ g within 24 hours .
&quot; to prevent bacterial growth , the responsible state authority can determine that the Re@@ agen@@ z ( or the supplied sol@@ o@@ cular and / or antibiotic ) is added , provided that the re@@ agen@@ z with the added substance remains the requirements of specific@@ ity and effectiveness . &quot;

&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood types may contain substances of human , animal , herbal ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective percentage , the others are the necessary means to reinforce the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agen@@ das . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective application in three groups . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that the re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents are unable to contain any substances of human origin . &quot;

&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS that depend on its cultivation the existence and the living standards of millions of families , which are in turn fully dependent on measures that are to maintain and increase the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in the not generated consumer countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that olive oil and Taf@@ el@@ oli@@ ven are essential in the areas , in which the olive @-@ building is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the essential characteristic of the olive production is the in@@ vari@@ ance of the harv@@ ests and market supply , and that this leads to fluctu@@ ations of production , prices and export holes as well as at very different levels of income ; &quot;
