&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public Transport Report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) , which explains how the study has been evaluated , in order to assess recommendations concerning the use of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your illness or treatment , please read the package name ( also part of E@@ PA@@ R ) or consult your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets ( tablets that apply in the mouth ) , as a solution to inser@@ tion ( 1 mg / ml ) and as inj@@ ecting solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. advanced thinking and Spe@@ ech , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( listening or seeing of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and del@@ u@@ sions ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , an mental illness , in which the patients man@@ ic episodes ( periods abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternat@@ ely with periods of normal mood . &quot;
bili@@ fy will be applied to the treatment of severe physical episodes and the prevention of oral episodes in patients suffering from the past to the medicine .
inj@@ ecting solution will be applied to rapid control of gest@@ ational anxiety or distur@@ ban@@ ces if the or@@ ale intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; for both diseases , the solution for inser@@ ting or melting can be applied in patients using the lo@@ osing of tablets difficulties . &quot;
&quot; patients who use other medicines at the same time , which are just as as@@ bili@@ fy , should be adapted to the dosage of A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole appears most of all as &quot; partial Ag@@ ists &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but appears in a lesser extent than the neur@@ otran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ amine play a role in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole carries to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms , and their re@@ appearance will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy , to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms , was examined in three studies of up to one year . &quot;
the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting treatment was compared to two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schizophren@@ ia or similar diseases that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been involved in 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ oper@@ dol , in another study the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy and placebo , which had been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms have already been stabili@@ zed with A@@ bili@@ fy . &quot;
the effectiveness of A@@ bili@@ fy injections was made in a study of 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder that was dra@@ ined by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medication ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
&quot; in all studies the change in symptoms of patients were examined by a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder , or the number of patients being studied in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting , and the solution for inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with inj@@ ecting patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy were received in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9,@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms projected anxiety than the patients who received a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the application of the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy has decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of more effective than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ bili@@ fy prevented far more effective up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re @-@ performing oral episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy injections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extr@@ ap@@ plau@@ ding ) , se@@ dation ( p@@ id@@ ation ) , se@@ dation ( p@@ id@@ ation ) , vom@@ iting , nau@@ tical ( p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion ( con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ ob@@ struction ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( in@@ difference disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ bili@@ fy helps in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and from mid @-@ severe to severe man@@ ic episode in patients who had mainly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole spoke to predomin@@ ate the risks .
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ecting solution in the rapid control of gest@@ ed anxiety and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schizophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if an or@@ derly therapy is not suitable to predomin@@ ate the risks . &quot;
in June 2004 the European Commission hosted the Company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd. approved for the establishment of A@@ bili@@ fy throughout the European Union .
&quot; AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients , which had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independently of the meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , independent of meals as a mono@@ therapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y in the treatment of schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor is set out of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ icide behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders , and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epidemi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder no increased addiction risk with Ari@@ pi@@ ans is compared to other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole should be applied with caution in patients with well known cardiovascular disease ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , body in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular diseases , conditions that may be applied to hyp@@ ot@@ ony ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure wash@@ ers ) or hyper@@ ton@@ ia ( including ak@@ cel@@ eri@@ ed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ z@@ ole Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if a patient treated with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y treated patients signs and symptoms of a late idy@@ ll , should be considered to reduce dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient signs signs and symptoms that indicate to a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti @-@ psych@@ otic drugs must be set off . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole should be applied in patients with var@@ ic@@ ol@@ ite cases in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states , which are applied with caution , with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole in patients with psych@@ osis , associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , had treated patients suffering with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , an increased mortality compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the appeal for un@@ cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients suffering from atyp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic agents , including AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related unwanted events involving AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y and other atyp@@ ical anti @-@ psych@@ otic medicines that allow direct comparisons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly be monitored with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed in schizophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia , the use of anti @-@ psych@@ otic diseases , where weight gain is observed as a side @-@ effect , and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central efficient drugs with itself over @-@ level side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ ant@@ agonist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a stomach acid blo@@ cker , reduces the remains of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , but this effect does not prove to be clin@@ ically relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy Pro@@ ban@@ kers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ din ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole to 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as Flu@@ ox@@ etine and par@@ ox@@ etine , similar effects have and therefore should have similar dose @-@ duc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; &quot; poor &quot; &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans can result in common use with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ons compared to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the common gift from K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y , the potential benefits should prevail to the patient &apos;s potential risks . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ t@@ az@@ ol and HIV pro@@ release bit@@ ors , should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose @-@ duc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; after dra@@ fting the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 auto@@ bit@@ ors , the dosage should be raised by AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y to the dose level before the beginning of the companion therapy . &quot;
D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em or E@@ sc@@ it@@ al@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are administered together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y together with AB@@ IL@@ IF@@ Y can be calculated with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ az@@ ure concentrations .
&quot; clinical studies showed doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole per day , no significant effect on the met@@ abol@@ ism of sub@@ str@@ ates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( War@@ me@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ phic ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be advised to notify their physician , if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for the safety of people and due to the concerns raised in animal studies , this medicine may not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , even with other anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , patients should be warned of , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following side effects appear more frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than under placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schizophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks joined in patients suffering from Ari@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ema and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia compared to patients who were treated with Hal@@ oper@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % was in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study for 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients , which were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ ker@@ in therapy . &quot;
man@@ ic episodes with Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder - In a controlled study of 12 weeks was the incidence of EPS 2@@ 3.5 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ zol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.@@ 3 % in patients suffering from semi@@ dol treatment .
&quot; in another study about 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26.@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term recovery period over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ er@@ zol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ ely controlled laboratory parameters appeared , yiel@@ ded no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases the CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ ine @-@ phosph@@ ate ase ) , generally temporarily and as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole patients , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; amongst the side effects which can occur in connection with an anti @-@ psych@@ otic therapy , and above whose appearance is also reported in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ nasty events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the launch , un@@ intended or inten@@ tional over@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole were observed only in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death sentence . &quot;
&quot; although there are no information about the effectiveness of a pen@@ di@@ aly@@ sis in treatment of over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole ; however , it is unlikely that hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis is in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma coverage . &quot;
it is thought that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole in schizophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is im@@ par@@ ted .
Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole showed in vit@@ ro a high aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 2 and D@@ 3 recep@@ tor and for ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor as well as an excessive Aff@@ inity for dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recep@@ tor and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ ad@@ ren@@ ces and for hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ recep@@ tor .
&quot; in case of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole in dos@@ ages from 0.5 to 30 mg once daily for 2 weeks to healthy pro@@ ban@@ den showed the Pos@@ ite E@@ missions diagnostics , a D2 / D@@ 3 recep@@ tor @-@ lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ c@@ us and at the coup . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) at 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schizophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms showed arias in comparison to placebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a half @-@ controlled trial in week 52 the proportion of respon@@ dents used to be responsible for studying medicine in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ oper@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values from meas@@ ur@@ als defined as secondary study destinations , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - antidepress@@ ants scale , showed a significantly stronger bet@@ tering than at Hal@@ oper@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study for 26 weeks at stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schizophren@@ ia , an significantly higher reduction of the relap@@ sing rate rose by 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole Group and in 57 % among placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in controlled , multinational double @-@ blind study involving schizophren@@ ia ( N = 18 or 13 % of the most valuable patient data sets ) with significantly less patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the initial value ( i.e. an increase of at least 5,@@ 6 kg in average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole compared with placebo over placebo over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole on placebo no superior effectiveness .
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo@@ - and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bee @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole showed a compared to placebo over placebo @-@ superior effectiveness in week 3 and a consumer effect that was comparable to that of lithium or neck@@ lace in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole also pointed out in week 12 a comparable share of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the Man@@ ia on , like lithium or semi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks involving patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , the accompanying therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole yiel@@ ded an superior effectiveness in reducing Man@@ ic symptoms compared to the mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term exp@@ and@@ ment over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients , which had achieved a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole during a stabili@@ zing phase in relation to placebo with regard to the prevention of a bi@@ polar back@@ bone , princip@@ ally in the prevention of a back@@ bone . &quot;
&quot; based on in vit@@ ro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ y@@ dri@@ fication and hydro@@ xy@@ de@@ fication of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ ky@@ uation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the average eli@@ min@@ ation period is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole on exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ism , over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and near 14@@ 6 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ ism through C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy pro@@ ban@@ ces , just as demonstrated in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study of schizophren@@ ic patients . &quot;
a well @-@ specific evaluation to the pharmaceutical indu@@ ine@@ tic yiel@@ ded no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to ethnic origin or the effect of smoking on the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe kidney failure in comparison to young healthy Pro@@ ban@@ ds .
&quot; a single dose @-@ study with Pro@@ ban@@ radi@@ os cir@@ rh@@ osis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect regarding the impairment of liver function to the phar@@ yn@@ chron@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ qu@@ z@@ ole and de@@ hydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , but the study comprised only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;

&quot; toxic@@ ological effects have been observed only in doses or ex@@ positions that have clearly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to man , so they have limited , or no meaning for the clinical use only . &quot;
the effects embr@@ aced a dose @-@ dependent secondary toxicity ( Li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin @-@ pig@@ ment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ fish disease ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( the 10@@ C to 10@@ mg / kg / day ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of people with the recommended maximum dose of people ) .
&quot; moreover , a chol@@ eli@@ tist asis was determined as a result of the reduction of sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ lo@@ z@@ ate ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended clinical dose or the 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose of people based on mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; however , carried out in the human G@@ alle with the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found concentrations of the sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate of Hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ ec@@ z@@ ole , no more than 6 % of the concentrations that were found in the study of 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys , and are far below border values ( 6 % ) of vit@@ ro sol@@ ub@@ ility . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits these effects have been observed after do@@ ings , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3@@ - and 11@@ times of the middle ste@@ ady @-@ State AU@@ C in the recommended stage Maxim@@ al@@ d@@ osis . &quot;

&quot; according to the present knowledge , due to the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney failure , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ zed , the progression of kidney failure is not accelerated . &quot;
in tum@@ ors below chemotherapy should be taken into account for assessing the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and the Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin @-@ response ( patients who may have to be trans@@ acted ) .

the decision for the application of combin@@ ant Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ urs should be based on the benefit of the respective patient who should also consider the specific clinical context .

&quot; in addition , it can not be excluded that in treating epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa to patients with a starting point @-@ glo@@ glo@@ bic value of &gt; 13 g / d@@ l an elevated risk for post@@ operative arthritis / vas@@ cular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ chs was not proven that they can survive the overall survival of tum@@ ours with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia or dimin@@ ishing the risk of tum@@ ors . &quot;

the most common side @-@ effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ ton@@ ia .
an increased incidence of thro@@ mbo@@ vas@@ cular events ( see section 4.@@ 4 and Section 4.@@ 8 - General ) has been observed in patients under treatment with er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .

the overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oses and therefore related complications in re@@ combin@@ ant humane Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin patients and at inspections .
&quot; there is an elevated risk of anthrop@@ ic events in tum@@ ours of tum@@ ours that can be treated with re@@ combin@@ ant humane Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clarified , how far these results are handled on the application of re@@ combin@@ ant humane Er@@ y@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tum@@ ult patients , with the aim of transferring a hem@@ ost@@ asis value under 13 g / d@@ l , since a few patients with these characteristics were included in the checked data . &quot;

&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after treatment ; patients with hat@@ s should receive a big dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or inj@@ ecting in a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a can reduce the symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and headaches . &quot;
&quot; to treat the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get may be prescribed A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a just by doctors , who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is the same as in Z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material was used for Z@@ om@@ eta to evaluate A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and the number of vert@@ ebr@@ ations and hip frac@@ tures has been examined over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study comprised of 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which had recently suffered a frac@@ ture , the number of frac@@ tures has been examined over a period of up to five years . &quot;
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was tested in two studies at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another Bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) .
the main indicator of the effectiveness was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase has declined in the ser@@ um ( an enzyme that sank in blood ) in blood or decreased at least 75 % compared to the output value .
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of spinal frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) was reduced over a period of three years compared to the patients under placebo by 70 % . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under placebo , the risk of hip frac@@ tures has been reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study involving men and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a a frac@@ ture ( 92 from 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most of the side @-@ effects of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent during repeti@@ tive in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a must not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Zol@@ ed@@ ric acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other components .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ ates , patients at A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a are subject to the risk of kidney disease , reactions to in@@ fusion and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ dying of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a provides information material for physicians to prescri@@ be the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis , which contains information about how the medicine is applicable , as well as similar material for patients , in which the unwanted side effects of the drug are explained and noted when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should be used A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a just by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get .
&quot; after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , a long run @-@ up period was observed in patients applying to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to twice daily at least 500 mg basic calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;

patients with kidney disorder ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) With patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min is not recommended A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a since limited clinical experience for this group of patients .
older patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary because the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to the younger . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age because data on un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness are missing .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is not recommended in patients with severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ability &lt; 35 ml / min ) because for this patient population only have limited clinical experiences .
an pre @-@ existing hypo@@ cr@@ a@@ emia is before the start of the therapy with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a due to sufficient supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid integration of the effect of customs lic acid on bone structure , a temporary agency can develop with symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

kidney disorder bund@@ ling was associated with kidney dys@@ functions that expressed themselves as withdrawal of kidney function ( i.e. an increase in the ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) and in rare cases as acute kidney failure .
the change in Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the incidence of kidney failure as well as a restricted kidney function were compared to oste@@ opor@@ osis for over three years compared to the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um @-@ Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a patients compared to 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary lim@@ atic calcium levels entered below the normal Swan range ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , at 2.3 % of patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in a large clinical study treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies treated . &quot;
&quot; all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study for preventing clinical frac@@ tures after one hip replacement and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on avoiding clinical frac@@ tures after a recent exp@@ iry level , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , however the majority of patients received a initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of vitamin D in front of the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions after administration of customs acid in a major clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion place , such as redness , swelling and / or pain , reports ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses in the oral area occasionally became , especially in cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ ses ( primarily in the max@@ il@@ field ) reported that with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including customs lic acid , were treated . &quot;
many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients following the tooth extraction or other dental attack .

&quot; in the case of over@@ dose which leads to a clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia , can be achieved through gift of or@@ ally calcium and / or a intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium @-@ glu@@ con@@ at . &quot;
clinical effectiveness in the treatment of post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis ( P@@ FT ) the effectiveness and safety of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown at post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 women aged between 65 and 89 ) with either one bone body fat or a BM@@ D 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spinal body .
effects on morph@@ om@@ etric vert@@ ebr@@ ates A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a lowered significantly over a period of three years as well as already after a year the frequency of one or more new flu@@ ke @-@ gra@@ ins ( see table 2 ) .
A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a reduction of 60 % reduced risk of vert@@ ebr@@ ations compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0,@@ 00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on Hü@@ frac@@ tures of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a showed a consistent effect over three years , resulting in a reduction of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % up to 58 % ) reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a increased the bone density at the lum@@ bar spine , hips and on the dist@@ al radius compared to the placebo @-@ treatment significant at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

bone hist@@ ology With 152 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pelvic floor .
a micro@@ computer@@ ised ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treated patients compared to placebo an increase in mass bon@@ y volume and the preservation of the se@@ cular bone architecture .
bone replacement selected The bones @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ ate ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale Pro@@ pe@@ p@@ ti@@ d of type @-@ I@@ - collagen ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in the ser@@ um and the beta @-@ C @-@ Tel@@ op@@ ep@@ ti@@ d ( b @-@ CT@@ X ) in the ser@@ um , determined by 5@@ 17 to 1.@@ 24@@ 6 patients in perio@@ dic intervals . &quot;
the treatment with an annual 5 @-@ mg dose of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a reduced B@@ SAP after 12 months was significantly reduced by 30 % compared to the initial value and was held at 28 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ X was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the output value of up to 36 months .
&quot; vitamin D levels were not rout@@ in@@ ely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
the total activity was at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on the bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total th@@ ens and gift @-@ up at all times .
the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a treatment led over 24 months compared to placebo treatment at a increase in BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % on the total surface and around 4.3 % on the Schengen .
clinical effectiveness in men In the H@@ OR@@ IZ@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months .
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the frequency of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % on placebo .
in another study involving men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 44@@ 6@@ M2@@ 30@@ 8 ) the once yearly administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a compared to the once weekly gift of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at referred to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar vert@@ eb@@ ra@@ e after 24 months in comparison to the initial value .

11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg customs ra@@ lic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months studies studies .
in the combined results after 6 months a similar decrease of the pain and pain rel@@ ie@@ ce was observed compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .
patients who were classified as Respon@@ si@@ ders at the end of six month &apos;s main study ( in therapy ) could be taken into an after@@ ward phase .
&quot; 143 by 143 with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a and the 107 with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age treated to patients suffering from the follow @-@ up study was compared with 71 of patients to be treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at , compared with 71 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ age patients in 18 months after application . &quot;
&quot; unique and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg customs ra@@ lic acid at 64 patients included the following pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , which proved to be dose @-@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma bars took fast up to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 hours , followed by a long @-@ lasting phase very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ times , ½ α 0,@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long Eli@@ min@@ ation phase with a tempor@@ al elimination period of ½ g 14@@ 6 hours . &quot;
&quot; the early stages of distribution ( α and β ) , with the above ( ½ -@@ values ) , probably represent the fast Res@@ or@@ ption in the bones and the ex@@ cre@@ tion of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose are found in the urine , while the rest is mainly tied to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose of 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to the decrease of customs clearance by 30 % at the end of in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished Clear@@ ance from cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabolic substances is unlikely because Zol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid can not be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by humans , and because they are a ste@@ er or no direct and / or irreversible , metabolism @-@ dependent in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The renal Clear@@ ance of Zol@@ ed@@ ric acid is cor@@ related with the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ; namely 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance , and was with the 64 examined patients in the mean 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) . &quot;
from this it results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and moderate kidney disorder up to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of customs lic acid .
&quot; because for heavy kidney disorder ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only constra@@ ined data , are not possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxicity The highest non @-@ acting intraven@@ ous semi @-@ dosage was reduced by mice 10 mg / kg body weight and for rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; for studies in dogs , individual d@@ ants of 1.@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on AU@@ C the 6@@ ple of recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administered for a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ zy awareness . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxicity in trials with intraven@@ ous application was administered in intervals of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , estimated at intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulated dose which corresponds to the 7@@ times of human therapeutic exposure , related to AU@@ C , corresponds to ) , well tolerated . &quot;

&quot; the most common occurrence in studies with repeated application was a multip@@ licity of spontane@@ ity in the metap@@ hysi@@ cal of the long bones in the growth phase with nearly all doses , a refund , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ resor@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;

&quot; Zol@@ ed@@ ronic acid is a representative of a sub@@ stan@@ z@@ genic class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the button . &quot;
&quot; dimin@@ ishing blood levels of the sex hormones , especially o@@ estrogen made from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ arranged which makes bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works by pressing the bone structure , thereby re@@ alises a normal bone formation , thus giving the bone strength again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or need to undergo a dental surgery , inform your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; using A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff , if you use other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you use medicine , known to them that they are ashamed of the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; for use of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a along with food and drink , you worry that in accordance with the instructions of your doctor to take sufficient fluid before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a V@@ ene .
&quot; when you have recently broken down the hips , the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a is recommended to make two or more weeks after the operative care of the envelope . &quot;
Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get The usual dose is 5 mg that is administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a V@@ ene .
&quot; because A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a works for a long time , you will possibly need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
&quot; it is important to follow these instructions exactly , so that the calcium levels in your blood in time after in@@ fusion is not too low . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get you can have A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a was missed setup you will contact your doctor or hospital to arrange a new date .
&quot; before ending the treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a If you are considering the termination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , please take your next doctor &apos;s check true and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion are very frequently occurring ( in more than 30 % of patients ) are following the subsequent inclu@@ sions but less frequent .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and headaches , occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a causes this irregular heart@@ thro@@ b , but you should report to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to low cal@@ orie concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ acks or self @-@ abu@@ sive or num@@ bes feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

&quot; persistent pain and / or non @-@ healing wounds in the mouth or on the j@@ aw were primarily reported in patients , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other disorders . &quot;
&quot; about allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , Nes@@ sel@@ en@@ schlag and angi@@ o@@ e@@ dem@@ a ( such as swelling at the face , the tongue or in the throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ists or nursing staff , if any of the listed side effects you have considerably affected or you notice any side effects which are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not directly used , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until application ; normally 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C up to 8 ° C . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hi@@ frac@@ ture is recommended , in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip re@@ frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a , patients must be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is particularly important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid integration of the effect of customs lic acid on bone structure can develop a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ z@@ emia whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable when patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get an adequate intake of calcium , according to at least twice daily 500 mg elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the Gift of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently low @-@ trau@@ matic hi@@ frac@@ ture , a starting dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ al@@ or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D is recommended before in@@ fusion of A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a . &quot;

&quot; 5.3 The pre@@ clinical data for safety he has been reported to include unwanted effects which have not been observed in clinical trials , which were exemp@@ t from animals to exposure in human therapeutic areas , were deemed as possibly relevant for clinical use : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases the beginning of con@@ vul@@ sions associated with ver@@ dic@@ ated stress seems to be related to the handling of animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant over a longer period before the p@@ airing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed a recovery from the initi@@ als of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant allowed , so no unwanted effects were observed on the he@@ at@@ eness or cy@@ kl@@ ash disorders . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was investigated on the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , a exposure to Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and by Lac@@ tation does not cause any changes in learning behaviour or in memory . &quot;

abstract of the E@@ PA@@ R for the public This document is a summary of the European Public administration report ( E@@ PA@@ R ) in which the study was evaluated as the Committee on Human Research ( CH@@ MP ) in order to assess recommendations concerning the use of the drug .
acet@@ one is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mono@@ therapy ) in patients ( especially obes@@ e patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) can be applied . • It can be applied together with another di@@ abet@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ( Du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose can not be satisfac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ment or insulin , the current dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ res@@ ins or insulin can be maintained at the beginning of the account treatment , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here the dose of the sul@@ ph@@ yl@@ res@@ ins or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s body is better exploited and the blood sugar level is reduced , which allows type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 400 patients were investig@@ ating the effectiveness of accounts in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ment , in addition they received either accounts or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos lead to a reduction in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which allows the blood sugar to be reduced in use of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study the effect of the additional gift of account for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ ment in a reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values decreased by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional Gift of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 2@@ 89 patients , the patients , the accounts in addition to insulin , compared to 0.2 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in the patients who were additionally placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effects associated with accounts were visual disorders , infections of the upper respiratory tract ( cooling ) , weight gain and hypo@@ th@@ esi@@ esthesia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients who may possibly re@@ sensitive ( allergic ) compared to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other ingredients , even in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ( high K@@ et@@ on@@ mirror - Sä@@ ur@@ esp@@ ace - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that accounts in the context of a mon@@ otherapy ( in some use ) should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission hosted the European Commission Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited approved for the transfer of accounts of accounts across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved and wear on one side the mark &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar has dis@@ continued with insulin , and where met@@ form@@ ers are in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or in@@ toler@@ ability ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are endangered by the presence at least a risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of in@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , gaining weight , or oils , especially those with reduced kar@@ mic reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of in@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , gaining weight and oils , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is applied in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was carried out .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports about zinc in@@ suffici@@ ency appears , which however does not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver enzymes ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard area ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
&quot; if the AL@@ T level increases up to 3 @-@ times of the ceiling of the standard area , the liver enzymes are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that refer to a hep@@ atic erectile dysfunction , such as un@@ resolved nausea , vom@@ iting , ti@@ redness , loss , appetite and / or dark@@ er resin , are the liver enzymes to check . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient will continue with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be directed by the laboratory parameters of clinical evaluation .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight is detected , that can be absorbed by fatty deposits and in some cases associated with a fluid . &quot;
as a result of a bun@@ et@@ ly joined under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one a slight reduction in the middle hem@@ ost@@ ent@@ rate ( relative reduction around 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction to 4.@@ 1 % ) .
similar changes have been observed in compar@@ atively controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one for patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis to 3 @-@ 4 % and insulin ( relative reduction of hem@@ ost@@ asis to 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased insulin @-@ sensitive therapy consists of patients , the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or triple @-@ combination therapy with a sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ material or as branch @-@ combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the launch of a market launch was reported below the treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , over a occurrence or deterioration of a diabe@@ tic bro@@ ul@@ a@@ e@@ de@@ ms with a reduction in visual acu@@ ity . &quot;
it is unclear whether there is a direct link between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ ms if patients report on disorders of visual acu@@ ity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic evaluation should be considered .
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone breeding , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture was 1.@@ 9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for examination of cardiovascular events , included with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) in patients suffering from comparing medi@@ ums . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs it is possible to rep@@ el treatment ( see Section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies for examining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effects on the pharmaceutical o@@ ine@@ tics or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines which are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. or@@ ale contrac@@ ep@@ tive , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium @-@ channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) resulting in an increase in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one around the 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) performed in a reduction in AU@@ C of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
&quot; this is due to that , due to treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased insulin resistance from breast reduction , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for feder@@ ate growth . &quot;
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rarely &lt; 1 / 10000 , single incidents : unknown ( of this data is not invaluable ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change of the turbine and the Bre@@ ad of Lin@@ se as they can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic properties .
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one entered AL@@ T champi@@ ons over the triple number of standard division , but often compared to placebo , but less rare than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ oses . &quot;
in an Out@@ come study in patients with existing advanced macro@@ vas@@ cular disease was the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 1.6 % higher than under placebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the market launch has rarely been reported by heart failure under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , however , if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was applied in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted in summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone breeding , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated groups and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with compar@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years ongoing pro@@ active study , frac@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.@@ 1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) with patients infected with a comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; when taking the maximum dose of 120 mg / day for four days , then 180 mg / day more than seven days , no symptoms appeared . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific core recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which results in the animal model to an increased insulin of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces the glu@@ co@@ se@@ production in the liver and the peripher@@ al glucose levels in case of insulin resistance .
a clinical trial with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as mon@@ otherapy has been pursued over two years in order to investigate the time up to the post@@ end of the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 treatment months ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the therapy started , a blood sugar was defined ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of patients ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ eable study of 12 months , patients , whose blood sugar , despite a three @-@ month optimization phase with insulin , was dis@@ car@@ ded , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in case of patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced itself by 0.@@ 45 % , compared to the patients who continued to have insulin ; a reduction of insulin treatment in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
in clinical trials over a year pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed themselves a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine system compared to the output values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( Mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small town on type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical studies compared to placebo a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol levels as well as low , however clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plas@@ h@@ ub@@ gl@@ yp@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in L@@ DL cholesterol levels , while in met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ aci@@ d dimin@@ ished values were observed . &quot;
a study of 20 weeks reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels this can be observed both via a effect on tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ de absorption and the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ de synthesis .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients were random@@ ised with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced advanced macro@@ macro@@ vas@@ cular disease in groups , in addition to existing anti@@ diabe@@ tic and cardiovascular therapy either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly absorbed into account , with the top @-@ concentrations of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one on plasma 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis the contribution from M @-@ IV to effectiveness in roughly the triple of the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II minimal marked . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ Studies , it could not be proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on the pharmaceutical and pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ om@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tor ) increases or lo@@ wers the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to the application of radio@@ active mark@@ ers in humans , the mark@@ er was found mainly in the bag ( 55 % ) and a lower extent in Har@@ n ( 45 % ) . &quot;
the mean plasma @-@ elimination of un@@ changing pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one amounts to man 5 @-@ 6 hours and all of the active met@@ amorph@@ oses is 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plasma @-@ concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its met@@ amorph@@ oses are lower in patients with reduced kidney function , with healthy Pro@@ ban@@ ds , with the instal@@ ments of the or@@ derly clearing of the mother substance but resem@@ ble . &quot;
&quot; in to@@ xi@@ der@@ ological studies , on mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ding after repeti@@ tive administration of plasma @-@ magnific@@ ation with here@@ after , an@@ a@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;
&quot; this is attribut@@ able to it that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one that dimin@@ ished in the link@@ age of non @-@ insulin resistance and increased insulin resistance , thereby reducing the availability of the metabolic sub@@ str@@ ates for feder@@ ate growth . &quot;
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) were induc@@ ed by the lat@@ te increased inci@@ den@@ ces of hyper@@ pl@@ asia ( for male and female rats ) and tum@@ ors ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary epitheli@@ um .
&quot; in a animal model of famili@@ arization Poly@@ pos@@ is ( FA@@ P ) , the treatment with two other Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ ons lead to an increased frequency of colon@@ tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the &quot; &quot; 30 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture was 1.@@ 9 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient @-@ years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one per 100 patient @-@ years in women who were treated with a comparative medication .
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years for examination of cardiovascular events , included with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one treated patients with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one patients , compared with 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 questionn@@ aires per 100 patient years ) in patients suffering from comparing medi@@ ums . &quot;
in another study over two years the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de were examined .
in clinical trials over 1 year pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one showed themselves a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine system compared to the output values .
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the so@@ ber @-@ tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de but also improved the post@@ p@@ ran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on the tr@@ y@@ gly@@ ca@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the hep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ lic@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study identified the target with regard to their primary end@@ point , which constituted a combination of the overall actu@@ ality , non @-@ deadly m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ vas@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of leg arteries , place the results close to that by taking Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on are no cardiovascular risks associated with the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the &quot; &quot; 45 &quot; &quot; and on the other side the &quot; &quot; AC@@ T@@ OS &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events regarding bone breeding , controlled , double @-@ blind trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , showed an increased incidence of bone breeding in women . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane was investigated for a total of 2@@ 94 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes , in which the body is unable to use insulin in effective . &quot;
&quot; in the study , after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , which pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similarly strong as with another human@@ ities . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane should not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ic ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane may need to be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines which can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is to be found ) . &quot;
the Committee on Hum@@ anity &apos;s medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of acet@@ aph@@ an influenza in treating diabetes against the risks .
October 2002 divided the European Commission with Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S with a permit for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ ane throughout the European Union .
mixed insulin products are usually applied once or twice daily when a quick initial impact is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
injection needle needs to be loaded at least 6 seconds under the skin to ensure that the entire dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar has improved significantly , for example , due to an increased insulin therapy , the hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ warning symptoms can be altered and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change with regard to strength , brand ( manufacturers ) , insulin type ( quickly re@@ acting , bi@@ ph@@ as@@ hic , long acting insulin , or insulin or insulin @-@ method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin in animal origin ) can lead to that a change of dosage is required . &quot;
&quot; if there is a dosage adjustment to the patient when switching to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ han@@ es , these can be necessary in the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change of animal on human insulin , reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia showed less pronounced or otherwise than in their previous insulin . &quot;
&quot; traveling to travel across multiple time zones , the patient should be pointed out to obtain the Council of his doctor , as such journeys can be applied , that insulin and meals may be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore take into account possible interactions in the therapy and always consult their patients from other medicines .

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who have already seen signs of cryst@@ alli@@ ze deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or Gi@@ cht@@ boxes ( &quot; stones , &quot; i.e. greater pri@@ mal cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits that can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ inary tract is still approximately 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , still toxicity may occur , therefore , it is recommended that patients will take at least during the first six months of treatment with aden@@ ur@@ ic even further medicines to contrac@@ eption of gyp@@ sies . &quot;
the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transp@@ l@@ ant since it was not investigated for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the effectiveness of three different aden@@ o@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared to a placebo ( head@@ lamp ) and Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine to treat hypertension ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two doses of Adenauer ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day .
&quot; main indicator of the efficiency was the number of patients , whose ur@@ inary tract was in the blood for the last three measurements under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients , the aden@@ o@@ ic recorded in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily have 120 mg once daily , with the last three measurements a ur@@ inary tract in the blood of under 6 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side @-@ effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Hum@@ anity was made into the conclusion that aden@@ o@@ ic was more effective in lowering the ur@@ inary ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els in the blood , as Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but there is also a higher risk of side @-@ effects associated with heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ an@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ a@@ emia ( including one from the medical history known or current gyp@@ sies , and / or a gyp@@ sies ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ak@@ age bars after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still remains &gt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase at AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in case of patients with severe kidney , the efficacy and safety have not yet been fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and young people there are no experiences in children and young people , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this group of patients is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since it is not recommended in organizing transplan@@ ts , the use of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular disease The treatment of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ n@@ se@@ cular medicines , it can occur during the treatment beginning to become an acute gyp@@ sum case because by lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ ul@@ ur@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els initially ur@@ inary tract in the tissue . &quot;

liver infections Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of phase 3 have been slight refres@@ hes of the liver function at F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treated patients ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended to perform before the beginning of the F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ s , and in the further course depending on the clinical effect of a liver function ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ in Z@@ s were not carried out in@@ effective studies on F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at but it is known that the X@@ O @-@ shirts can lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( a shirt of the met@@ amorph@@ ous of The@@ ophysi@@ al which was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ shirts ) .
&quot; for Pro@@ ban@@ den was the simultaneous gift of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily , with an increase in F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and T@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 shirts was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase of unwanted events .

&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ta@@ zi@@ du@@ ms , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ id ( around 1 hour ) delays and a decline of the C@@ max by 32 % , but not significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not be close to side effects of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
experimental studies do not leave directly or indirect effects on pregnancy , embryonic development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle in order to serve machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities until they can be reasonably safe that AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC would not be detrimental to their performance .

the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial erotic disease and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ inf@@ estation or a de@@ generated con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side @-@ effects which could be reported in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients who are treated at the same time with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In the clinical studies there were not severe ras@@ hes or heavy over@@ sensitive reactions .

the events related to long @-@ term studies were similar to those reported in phase 3 studies ( see table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events have been reported in all F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ - treatment groups in total more than once , and occurred in patients who received F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term studies ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;

&quot; clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC has been described in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and study study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy point was in each study the proportion of patients in which the last three month were specified by certain Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ se@@ et bars &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a ser@@ um cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine value of &gt; 1.5 mg / d@@ l and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed with regard to lowering the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ se@@ et bars under 6 mg / d@@ l ( see table 2 and figure 1 ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x per day compared to the treatment with conventional used doses Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ act study demonstrated with regard to the continued lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ se@@ pi@@ eg@@ els under 6 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) the statisti@@ cally significant superiority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC 80 mg 1 x a day compared to the treatment with the conventional used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .

the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ se@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6.@@ 0 mg / d@@ l ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor &apos;s visit to the week of 2 and kept permanently over the entire treatment .
50@@ 9 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ um Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ assets &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,@@ 0 mg / d@@ l received 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney functioning The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney @-@ based block@@ age ( d. h ) .
with AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC the primary efficacy point has been rated at 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) to 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients .
&quot; there were no clinical significant differences in proportion to the virus @-@ acid re@@ con@@ centric , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ concentrations ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ P ) a ser@@ um har@@ n@@ ate con@@ centric of ≥ 10 mg / d@@ l .
&quot; the data collected in two years at the open exp@@ iry study of phase 3 showed that the continued lowering of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ se@@ cular level yiel@@ ded to &lt; 6 mg / d@@ l ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ l / l ) , resulting in less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a gyp@@ sum ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the gyp@@ sum size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete disappearance of the po@@ ison node until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ g / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term studies .
with healthy Pro@@ ban@@ an increased the maximum plasma @-@ concentrations ( C@@ max ) and the area under the Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C ) of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ ate after administration . simple and multi doses from 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; for doses of between 120 mg and 300 mg , a rise in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is bigger than the dos@@ si dis@@ proportionate increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking a simple or multi @-@ pler oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ max is about 2.8 @-@ 3,@@ 2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.@@ 0 @-@ 5.@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clinical significant change has been observed in percentage decline of ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ acid re@@ con@@ centric , if this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent ste@@ ady state volume ( V@@ SS / F ) from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at is located in the range of 29 to 75 l after ing@@ esting doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plasma coverage of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is over the concentration width , which is achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in vit@@ ro @-@ studies at human liver micro@@ som@@ en showed that these oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites are predominantly made by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ y@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ mark@@ ed F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found as un@@ changeable f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) , as well as further unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over urine they also found about 45 % of the dose in the stool as un@@ changeable f@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , whose known oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as further unknown Met@@ abol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
special patient @-@ groups renal in@@ suffici@@ ency After the intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild , moderate or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency changed the C@@ max of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in proportion not to proportion with normal kidney function . &quot;
the mean total of AU@@ C from F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at around the 1.8 @-@ times of 7.5 μ . h / ml in the group with normal kidney function on 13.@@ 2 μ . h / ml in the group with severe no@@ vels function .
&quot; 12 liver functional increase after ing@@ esting multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in patients with mild ( Ch@@ ild@@ - Pu@@ gh Classi@@ fication A ) , or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ Classi@@ fication A ) , the C@@ max and AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its met@@ amorph@@ oses did not change significantly compared to pro@@ ban@@ den with normal liver function . &quot;
age There have been no significant changes regarding AU@@ C of F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its met@@ amorph@@ ous to take multiple doses of AD@@ EN@@ UR@@ IC in older patients compared to younger subjects observed .
&quot; cin@@ ogen@@ esis , Mut@@ agen@@ ese , impairment of Fer@@ til@@ ity In male rats has been found a statisti@@ cally significant increase of urine infl@@ ated disease ( transitional disease @-@ pap@@ ill@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly @-@ treated group , in approximately the 11 @-@ times of exposure to man . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific Pur@@ in@@ metabolic and urine composition and are not relevant for clinical use as a result .
it has been found that F@@ eb@@ u@@ x@@ ost@@ at in or@@ derly doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on the fertility and reproduction power of male and female rats .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( one disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after men@@ opause in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or using other medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid irritation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down after the first food intake of the day , which is supposed to take 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in medicines that are approved in the European Union , the company placed data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study with 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to prove the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE regarding increasing the vitamin D reflection .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients were treated with low vitamin D levels in patients , which were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , lower ( 11 % ) than those who stayed exclusively al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data to specify that in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE , Al@@ end@@ onic dose is exactly the dose which is needed to prevent a bone loss . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ ache , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sy ( digestive disorders ) , per@@ sever@@ ance ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( ul@@ cer@@ a ) , coated abdom@@ en ( pu@@ ffed stomach ) as well as su@@ cking skin . &quot;

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or intake of medicines ( including An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
following tips are exactly to follow in order to reduce the risk of ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation and associated side effects ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) :
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed up after the end of the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or the tablet in the mouth as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be taking place before the first intake of the day before taking the tablet 30 minutes after taking the tablet .
&quot; B. pe@@ p@@ tic Ul@@ kus , active g@@ astro@@ intestinal tum@@ our or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ opla@@ sty , only given in particular caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , such as Ö@@ sop@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sion , rarely followed by ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al stri@@ k@@ ings , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partially these were severe and required a hospital assignment ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that are to point out to possible ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and the patients should be pointed out to prescri@@ bing the medicines , or retro@@ st@@ ern@@ al pain , or new or imp@@ lim@@ mer@@ ing down the medicine and capture medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe and op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects appears to be increased in patients , who do not take correctly the medicine and / or follow after the occurrence of symptoms that refer to a ös@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irritation , continue . &quot;
it is very important that all do@@ cking instructions will be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during the advanced clinical trial with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age no elevated risk has been found , rarely ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some severe and associated with complications ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;

&quot; there is no data available , the notes indicate whether the comp@@ ose of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need a lower surgical procedure , reducing the risk of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose from the j@@ aw . &quot;
clinical evaluation by the prescri@@ bing doctor is relevant to treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that when taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the pill should take the tablet in the next morning after they have noticed their verse .
&quot; you should not take two tablets on the same day , but intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the scheduled week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated adequate before the start of the treatment with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ end@@ ron@@ age foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , an@@ ta@@ zi@@ da and some or@@ derly medicines may affect the remn@@ ants of al@@ end@@ ron@@ age when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ studies have not been carried out , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age in clinical studies were taken together with a variety of usually prescribed medicines , without the clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;

&quot; Ad@@ vag@@ raf is given adult patients to prevent a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent a rep@@ lication of the transplan@@ ted organ through the immune system . &quot;
&quot; da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft has already been deployed in the EU , the company has submitted the results from previously carried out studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Ad@@ vag@@ raf with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was compared . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients in which the transp@@ l@@ ant after a treatment duration of a year was trun@@ cated ( by example testing how often a renewed transplan@@ tation or restart of di@@ aly@@ sis was needed ) .
&quot; in addition , further studies of 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients were carried out with liver transplan@@ tation and analysed how Ad@@ vag@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft came from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with severe hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro @-@ antibiotics ( such as Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or one of the other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines must be taken simultaneously with Ad@@ vag@@ raf as the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ dose or the dose of the drug must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with the immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy and the treatment of transp@@ l@@ ant patients should apply this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to transp@@ osition or increased incidence of side @-@ effects , including sub @-@ or over@@ immun@@ isation . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the formulation or the regime should only be conducted under the eng@@ masch@@ ige control of one in the transplan@@ tation experienced physician ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; following a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug surveillance and appropriate dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the systemic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remains intact . &quot;
&quot; the dosage of Ad@@ vag@@ raf should primarily be based primarily on clinical evaluation of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability in individual case and on blood @-@ level @-@ regulations ( see below &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ us , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the systemic exposure , measured as a mirror levels , with both formulations , both at Ni@@ er@@ - and in non @-@ transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
me@@ tic@@ ulous and repeated checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transp@@ l@@ ant under ad@@ vaginal raf in order to ensure appropriate substance exposure to the immediate follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; since Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , an adaptation of the Ad@@ vag@@ raf @-@ Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as can last several days until the ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post@@ operative phase , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentration in the manufacture of an in@@ fusion solution ) will be introduced with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the application to sup@@ pres@@ siveness of the transplan@@ tion must be sustained , consequently , consequently , the maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ant therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; other Dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations may be required later , since the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics can change from tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us during the course of stabil@@ ising the patient after the transp@@ l@@ ant . &quot;
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation Pro@@ phy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation The or@@ ale Ad@@ vag@@ ant therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf must be asked for a transp@@ osition of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules upon a once daily intake of Ad@@ vag@@ ant capsules , so this change has in relation to 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants to Ad@@ vag@@ raf once daily must begin the treatment with the initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis for the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ tation of the transplan@@ tation .
&quot; heart transp@@ l@@ ant With adult patients , who are converted to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , is an or@@ ale Initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily . &quot;
&quot; other transp@@ l@@ ant drugs however does not have a clinical experience with Ad@@ vag@@ raf in pulmon@@ ary , pan @-@ cancer and col@@ on @-@ transplan@@ ted patients , there arrived in an or@@ derly initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 10 mg / kg / day and in intestinal wast@@ es in an or@@ derly initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood vessels in the targeted area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions a reduction of dose .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function since the kidney function has no effect on the phar@@ yn@@ o@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of kidney function ( including a regular identification of the ser@@ ver@@ incre@@ mental level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ cy , and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching of Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in on Ad@@ vag@@ raf in conversion from one Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations on the valley level in full blood The dose should primarily be based on the clinical evaluation of rep@@ lication and toler@@ ability in the individual case with the aid of whole blu@@ ff@@ le @-@ tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ mirror controls .
&quot; it is recommended frequent checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by perio@@ dic checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ talent of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Ad@@ vag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ adaptation , changes of immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or with simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us thorou@@ gh@@ ness , ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Ad@@ vag@@ raf &apos;s a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may need several days until the Ste@@ ady State has entered . &quot;
&quot; the data in clinical trials can be concluded that a successful treatment in most cases is possible , if the mirror levels will not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; in clinical practice the out@@ mirror of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us in whole blood lie within the first time after liver transplan@@ ts usually within the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with ad@@ renal , and warm @-@ transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent treatment of liver , kidney and cardi@@ ac condition in general , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml are generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has resulted in severe undes@@ irable events , including transplan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always keep the same tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the formulation or the regime should only be conducted under the eng@@ masch@@ ige control of a medical device experienced in the transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 c@@ ur treatment of adult patients with transp@@ l@@ ant aid , turned out against other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants as therapies , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded wording Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; to the prophy@@ la@@ xis of the transplan@@ ts in adult cardi@@ ac disco@@ vers and transp@@ l@@ ant in childhood , there are still no clinical data for the retar@@ ded wording Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , is the intake of herbal supplements ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other herbal medicines during a treatment with Ad@@ vag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine concentrations in the blood is offered , since the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to considerable fluctu@@ ations under such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy was referred to as car@@ dio @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hia , which can therefore also occur under Ad@@ vag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart suffering , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , hypertension , hydr@@ ation or liver dys@@ functions , infections , hydr@@ ation and oil . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , the effect of sunlight or ultra@@ violet light should be restricted by appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection using a high protective factor . &quot;
&quot; when patients , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for pro@@ es such as headaches , changed consciousness levels , cro@@ achment and visual dys@@ functions , should a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. . &quot;
&quot; da Ad@@ vag@@ raf Hart@@ ble@@ i , retar@@ ded , l@@ act@@ ose , is recommended in patients with the rare her@@ edi@@ tary g@@ act@@ ose in@@ tolerant , l@@ act@@ ase shortage or glucose compounds special caution . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ or or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus increase the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ ine - blood levels can change with simultaneous administration of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism , and to adjust the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dose to maintaining equal concentrations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
a strongly distinctive interaction was associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ k@@ oti@@ ka such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ol , I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and V@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ol and with the Macro@@ lid An@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV pro@@ release . &quot;
&quot; pharmaceutical studies stimulate the increase in blood levels chie@@ fly from the elevated bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , due to the in@@ hibition of the astro@@ intestinal lining , results . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ based pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ on , as used in acute disp@@ ens@@ ation actions , the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can increase or decrease in the blood . &quot;
effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us on the metabolism of other medicines Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us with medicines can be met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 metabolism .
&quot; da Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us bring down the clearing of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills , and thus increase the hormone exposure , it is particularly cautious when making decisions about recep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animals have shown that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can reduce the clearing of Pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and extend their half @-@ value .
&quot; the results of a small number of investigations on transplan@@ tation patients do not provide any indication that under Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , compared to other immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants , an increased risk of unwanted events with regard to the course and the result of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a surveillance of new@@ bor@@ ns advocates possible effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a Hyper@@ k@@ ali@@ a@@ emia of the newborn ( incidence 8 of 111 newborn children ) , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effective profile of immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants can often be found precisely because of the patient &apos;s disease and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; below , the side effects are listed after their incidence in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on basis of the available data is not invaluable ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and parasi@@ tic disorders How well @-@ known among other highly effective immun@@ os@@ up@@ press@@ ants is treated in patients suffering with tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , gi@@ ve@@ al ) frequently increased . &quot;
&quot; cases of B@@ K @-@ Virus @-@ Associ@@ ated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C @-@ Virus @-@ Associ@@ ated progressive Multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ encephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy , including therapy with Ad@@ vag@@ us therapy . &quot;
it was reported on ben@@ ign or mal@@ ign@@ ant Ne@@ oplas@@ men including EB@@ V@@ - Associ@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ pro@@ lifer@@ ative diseases and skin tum@@ ours in conjunction with the treatment of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , its low water sol@@ ub@@ ility and the high degree of er@@ y@@ thro@@ cy@@ tes and plas@@ map@@ rot@@ one can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is not di@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
active drug mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On molecular level should be conve@@ yed the effects of tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us by its bond to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ K@@ B@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for the en@@ rich@@ ment of the connection in the nucleus .
this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent inhi@@ ation of signal transmission due to the T @-@ cell and thus prevents the trans@@ cription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ w@@ kin genes .
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us oppressed the activation of T @-@ cells and of the T @-@ hel@@ m cells of the B @-@ cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ ins ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and g @-@ interfer@@ on ) as well as the expression of the Inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 recept@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; Adv@@ ate is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII , inn@@ ate bleeding disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application are based on whether advent to the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding in surgical procedures .
patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII shortage which causes blood flow problems like bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is produced according to a method created as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; :
it is produced by a cell that has been incorporated into a gene ( DNA ) which resulted in the formation of the human scent factor VIII .
&quot; Adv@@ ate is another approved drug in the European Union called Rel@@ o@@ ads , similar but will be different , so that the medicine does not contain proteins or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies of patients suffering from severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study involving 53 children under six years of age , the application of the drug was investigated for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study the efficacy of Adv@@ ants in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood@@ sep@@ sis has been awarded &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; well &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , headaches , Py@@ re@@ xie ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate should not be applied in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , Maus@@ - or Ham@@ ster@@ protein or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission hosted the company Ba@@ x@@ ter AG approved for the establishment of Adv@@ entures of Adv@@ entures in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of substitution therapy depends on the severity of the factor VIII scar@@ city , according to the location and extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following mor@@ mor@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the effect of VIII activity in the respective period is not supposed to sink under the specified plasma bars ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / d@@ l ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and acute draw@@ backs are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years of age ) until the danger for the patient is over .
&quot; during the treatment process , it is advised for the control of the inj@@ ectable dose and the frequency of the injections , an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plastic bars . &quot;
individual patients may differ in their response to VIII to distinguish various in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be passed from factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plastics can not be achieved or if the bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out if required to detect an In@@ d@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inflation , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be investigated . &quot;
&quot; the deadline is to be directed after the patient , with a maximum inj@@ ected rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of Neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ d@@ bit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VIII oriented Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which can be quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml of plasma via modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ relate to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , where the risk within the first 20 Ex@@ position@@ ings is on the largest and dependent of genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 Ex@@ position@@ ists and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ sch known inhibit@@ or development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the reproduction of ( lower ) inhibit@@ ors observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare appearance of the Hä@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , the application of factor VIII during pregnancy and breastfeeding has no experience before . &quot;
&quot; the A@@ DR@@ s &apos;s largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) who , all in previously untreated patients , who have had a higher risk for the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headaches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , are not known ( frequency on the basis of the data available ) . &quot;

blood cl@@ ot@@ ting has been maintained throughout the period and both the factor of V@@ II@@ I@@ - Spiegel in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient value on the 15 post@@ operative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ ATE , 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 150 days ) showed only one patient after 26 expos@@ ures with A@@ DV@@ ATE a low in@@ d@@ bit@@ or@@ ti@@ ter ( 2,@@ 4 B.@@ E. in fashionable Beth@@ es@@ da @-@ approach ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , none of the 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of under 6 years and diagnosed more severe or moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VIII &lt; 2 % ) after previous exposure to factor V@@ II@@ I@@ - concentrations ( ≥ 50 days ) , was established in VIII @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in previously , patients of a current clinical trial formed 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ ATE treated patients In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; the immune response of patients on traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibodies against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant stimul@@ ant as well as an ongoing peak of the anti@@ body @-@ mirror against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell proteins , otherwise however , no sign or symptoms occur on an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the first use of the first data , the CH@@ MP has been rated as a positive effect , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP based on the safety pro@@ fil@@ s of A@@ DV@@ ATE , which makes an filing of PS@@ UR@@ s every 6 months , decided to apply for the authorization within 5 years for a further process . &quot;
December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited shared the approval of the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its application for approval from Adv@@ ex@@ in to the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer .
&quot; however , the chest , the brain , the bones , or the past@@ ure parts ( tissues which combines other structures in the body , surrounds and relies on it ) . &quot;
this is a type of virus that genetically modified genetically so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ es is a &quot; &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; which has changed so that there are no copies of yourself and thus no infections in humans can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been lowered directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the can@@ cer@@ ous cells to form the normal p@@ 53 protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed from the non @-@ def@@ ective in the human body of the p@@ 53 @-@ gene , contributes to the restoration of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA can not be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i Cancer , where the p@@ 53 @-@ gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 protein is not correct , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and divide . &quot;
&quot; the company put data from a study with a patient before , at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , in the bones , and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , there were still some questions un@@ solved . &quot;
&quot; based on the testing of the initial documents , the CH@@ MP agreed to a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
according to CH@@ MP was not sufficiently proven that the injection of Adv@@ ex@@ in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to the patient .
&quot; the committee also had concerns relating to the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that advoc@@ acy can be manufactured in a reliable way and that it is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
&quot; the company did not notify the CH@@ MP whether the appropri@@ ation of the patient has , currently taking part in clinical studies or &quot; &quot; com@@ bi@@ use &quot; &quot; programmes with Adv@@ ex@@ ams . &quot;
changed action release means that the tablets are combined so that one of the effective components are released immediately and the other is released slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat the symptom of seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s ( ha@@ y fever , caused by an allergy to pol@@ len regarding pol@@ len inflammation of the nose @-@ way ) in patients with nose @-@ skin swelling ( hidden nose ) . &quot;
in adults and young adults aged 12 years the recommended dose of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet that should be taken entirely with a glass of water with or without food .
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and ended up once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose @-@ loop ( pet@@ ri@@ ous nose ) . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can indul@@ ge on the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main effective stri@@ ches were the changes of severity of the hypo@@ cris@@ p symptoms which were reported by patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and evaluated with a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; in case of all ha@@ y disease symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze recorded via a decrease of the symptoms by 4@@ 6.3 % , compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nose @-@ s@@ ander was seen , the patients showed under the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze a allevi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patient , the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ abs ( cardi@@ o@@ lessness ) , phar@@ yn@@ gi@@ tis ( loss of appetite ) , ambul@@ ance , head@@ ache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness ) , som@@ ni@@ ol@@ enz ( beats ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may be used in patients who may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other ingredients , against ad@@ ren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( another drug to treat allergies ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients who suffer from a bot@@ t@@ angle glau@@ coma ( predomin@@ ant water pressure ) , cardi@@ ac or vas@@ cular disease ( hypertension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hypertension ) , or have a risk of hem@@ or@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission assigned to the Company SP Europe for approval by aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but it may be swal@@ low ( i.e. without breaking down , break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data on un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see section 5.1 ) not available in children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the end of the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the use of time to 10 days , since on long @-@ term application the activity of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine can take time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the grinding balls in the upper air@@ ways , the treatment can be continued with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ ob@@ a@@ ze pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients who treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks after completion of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is due to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ e@@ tic activity in a combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ des such as Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ p@@ tin , b@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amin or other Dek@@ on@@ ges@@ tiv@@ a , Phen@@ ice pro@@ pan@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ edr@@ ine , ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ ard etc . ) . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy have not been tested for this patient collective , and the data are not enough to speak relevant recommendations for the dosage . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver disorder , and the data are not enough to speak relevant recommendations for dosage . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed about the treatment at the appearance of hyper@@ ton@@ ia or t@@ ach@@ y@@ cardi@@ ac or p@@ ach@@ er@@ ations , cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ ache or a strengthening of head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of the following patient groups , caution is advised : • Pati@@ o among D@@ IG@@ ITA@@ L@@ IS • Pati@@ o with cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ cardi@@ ac disease in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder re@@ construction or bron@@ chi@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze is available at least 48 hours before carrying out der@@ mat@@ ological testing as anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka can otherwise prevent positive reactions to indicators of skin actions or reduce their extent .
&quot; in the context of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine , where Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered , however , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes of the plasma @-@ concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences could be found between the patients with disaster bearing inj@@ ectors and those treated with placebo , regardless of whether disaster might be taken alone or with alcohol . &quot;
the enzyme of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible Enzy@@ me has not yet been identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be completely ruled out .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in hem@@ med in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ strate nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the in@@ consistency of the use of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not secured , experience from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies , however , does not increase the frequency of abnorm@@ alities compared to the incidence of normal population . &quot;
since reproduction studies on animals are not always transmitted to humans and due to vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ ction properties of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy .
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , that in very rare cases it may come to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of transport or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished spiritual attention , cy@@ an@@ ants , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and one Z@@ NS stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ ess@@ ness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , trekking , con@@ vul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ tering flows . &quot;
&quot; head@@ ache , anxiety , complicated Mi@@ ktion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tone , euph@@ oria , arousal , respiratory heart failure , vom@@ iting , nausea , per@@ spir@@ ation , verti@@ go , axi@@ ally , axi@@ ally , axi@@ ally or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ ine @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth@@ piece , p@@ up@@ ill@@ ary ar@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , bon@@ net , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and g@@ astro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the in@@ hibition of the release of probi@@ otic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the roy@@ als of P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ m cells . &quot;
&quot; for a single dose of adults with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective wounds or the tasks linked to the fly . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily was detected no increased frequency of bats in comparison to placebo .
&quot; the oral application of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can cause further sympathetic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ mic or manifestations of a z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets were received . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the total cor@@ es for the symptom ( except nose @-@ loop ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ os@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the decl@@ ining effect , determined by the nose @-@ s@@ ine swelling , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
the effectiveness of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of gender , age or ethnic affili@@ ation groups . &quot;
within the framework of a single dose @-@ up study to the Phar@@ mo@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in within 30 minutes of administration of the plasma .
&quot; according to the per@@ or@@ derly application of aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze for healthy Pro@@ ban@@ gs over 14 days , the flow @-@ weight of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ sh@@ ad@@ in and pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
in the context of a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study which was performed with the formulation as a tablet to healthy adult pro@@ ban@@ s was found that four pro@@ ban@@ ish des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in badly injured .
a component Inter@@ ac@@ tion@@ study shows that exposure ( C@@ max and AU@@ C ) from pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in accordance with the amount of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was equivalent to exposure of a aer@@ on@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety technology , toxicity , toxicity , toxicity and reproduction , pre@@ dict the pre@@ clinical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in however does not recognize any particular dangers for the human being . &quot;
&quot; the combination has no larger toxicity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the content of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive @-@ production studies , the combination of Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in / pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in a dosage of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dosage of up to 120 mg / kg / day . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us was studied in eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies with seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness was measured by changing the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the qu@@ add@@ les , impairment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six @-@ week treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been presented to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to inser@@ ting and the melting coated tablets in the same way as the tablets and the use in children are harmless . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in , Lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission assigned to the Company SP Europe for approval of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once daily , with a or without a meal , to reli@@ eving the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there are limited experience from clinical studies for the effectiveness of des@@ lor@@ ence in young adults aged 12 to 17 ( see sections 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ sper@@ sed rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous illness and may end after the sound of the symptoms and can be resum@@ ed with their re@@ appearance .
&quot; in the persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( occurrence of symptoms to 4 or more days a week , and more than 4 weeks ) , patients may be recommended during the aller@@ gen time a continuous treatment . &quot;
clinical @-@ relevant interactions were not observed in the context of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ oos in tablets when Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study the effect of alcohol and alcohol was not increased by alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; patients should however be elu@@ ci@@ dated about it , that in very rare cases it may come to di@@ zz@@ iness that may lead to impairment of transport or the ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us reported than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently used side @-@ side effects , which was reported more frequently than with placebo , were ti@@ redness ( 1.2 % ) , mouth@@ dry ( 0.@@ 8 % ) and headaches ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 5@@ 78 you@@ thful patients from 12 to 17 years , the com@@ mon@@ est side effect head@@ ache , they were treated at 5.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ disciplinary study , where up to 45 mg of lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) have been administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of probi@@ otic cy@@ to@@ k@@ ines as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / Bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the roy@@ als of P @-@ sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a clinical study involving multiple multi @-@ workers , in the des@@ lor@@ ad@@ ad@@ in in a dosage administered up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , there was no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in disaster of 45 mg daily in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of clinical dose ) was administered for ten days , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls itself showed . &quot;
&quot; for an individual dos@@ ages study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes including the strengthening of subjective wounds or the tasks linked to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and itch of nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as the itch on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be classified in dependence on the duration of symptoms and alternatively in inter@@ mitt@@ ent rh@@ initi@@ s and pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;

pers@@ isting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms to 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown by the overall cor@@ es of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life at Rhino @-@ e@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of pri@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ology of the equ@@ ino@@ ology at the different forms is similar and chron@@ ically patients can be recru@@ ited easily . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , is expected that des@@ lor@@ atories in addition to other forms of urine can lead to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction in size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka in chronic idi@@ opathic urine , the minority of patients who re@@ acted not to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ acted from the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch by more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ ry in patients compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and the wax , as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate these variables . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmaceutical indu@@ ine@@ tic study , in which the patients &quot; dem@@ ots comparable with the general seasonal rh@@ initi@@ s population , was achieved in 4 % of patients a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in . &quot;
there are no locking points for a clin@@ ically relevant speculation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in responsible Enzy@@ me has not yet identified , so interaction with other drugs will not be completely excluded . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals to allevi@@ ate the symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see below section 5.1 ) .
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s are caused by children under 2 years of infection ( see below section 4.@@ 4 ) and that no data is available that support a inf@@ ective Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es should play a role in the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and corresponding laboratory studies . &quot;
around 6 % of adults and children aged between 2 and 11 years of metabolic rate met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze in restricted and experienced a higher sub@@ stan@@ z@@ ure ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , is identical to the metabolic metabolic rate , is identical to those with children who are normally metabolic . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains Sac@@ char@@ ose and Sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore patients should not take with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intolerance , glucose absorption or sac@@ redness of this medicine . &quot;
clinical @-@ relevant interactions were not observed in the context of clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition have been administered ( see below section 5.1 ) .
in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study it has not been reinforced in the simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side @-@ effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup Group like the placebo group .
&quot; clinical studies with adults and young people in different indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic pri@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side @-@ effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us , than in patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ group study of adults and adolescents , where up to 45 mg of lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) have been administered , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old that came into question for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received from 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic pri@@ est@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in in adults and children can be similar , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ ach@@ ad@@ in in adults can be ex@@ or@@ ised to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a clinical trial with multi @-@ workers in adults and juven@@ iles , in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily for 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically @-@ pharmac@@ ological study of adults and juven@@ iles , in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the nin@@ ety of clinical dose ) about ten days in adults was applied , no extension of the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls did not prove . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents was not determined by sle@@ ep@@ iness in comparison to placebo .
&quot; in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and young people in clinical studies have no impairment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it came due to the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induc@@ ed performance imp@@ rec@@ tification even to increase the sle@@ ep@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; with adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in reli@@ eving the symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nose secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ch@@ rei@@ z on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown by the overall cor@@ es of the questionnaire regarding the quality of life at Rhino @-@ e@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets are effectively produced by seasonal Rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was A@@ eri@@ us effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction in size and number of qu@@ add@@ les at the end of the first dos@@ is@@ inter@@ v@@ alls .
&quot; the spread of this limited metabolic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than in Cau@@ ca@@ sians ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study involving children aged 2 to 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s to ob@@ sc@@ ure the restricted metabolic rate .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in was after 3 to 6 hours approximately 6@@ times higher and the C@@ max about 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient in Kum@@ ulation after a daily use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) about 14 days in adults and young people .
12 In various single dose @-@ studies showed that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ max &apos; values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in at pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ in @-@ sy@@ rup in a dosage of 5 mg .

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. gave the approval to the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) officially associated with the approval of A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and older people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and older people to protect influenza ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of In@@ flu@@ enza @-@ A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which could cause a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ demic . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ pan@@ demic breaks off if a new strain of influenza virus emerging , which can easily spread from man to man because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine , the immune system recognises the immune system that contain parts of the flu virus as &quot; body alien &quot; and forms antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; by doing so , the immune system is later able to form in contact with a flu virus to form this gene@@ alogy faster . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane ke@@ epers of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membran@@ es surface , which recognizes the human body as body alien ) , certified and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not performed according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
this enables the extent of the clinical data base to evaluate the safety of the vaccine for the evaluation of the vaccine security guidelines to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA @-@ pan@@ demic vaccines .
&quot; should you take part in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like further information regarding the basis of the CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the E@@ PA@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with human immun@@ ode@@ ficiency Virus ( AIDS @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ isation of immun@@ ficiency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who can not swal@@ low the capsules , there is still available as a solution for inser@@ tion , but this cannot be taken along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the security of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be ordered when the doctor has tested , which the anti@@ viral medicines has been taken before , and the likelihood is judged that the virus is to address the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken along with twice daily 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
in children between the ages of four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ously depends on the body weight .
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , it reduces the HIV amount in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS does not cure AIDS , however , can delay the immune system and thus developing the development of HIV infections and diseases . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ asy has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected persons who were previously not covered with prot@@ eas@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this reinforced with low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r reinforced medicines A@@ gener@@ ase was taken at 20@@ 6 adults , which were previously taken to the release of protein . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the proportion of patients with un@@ det@@ ectable concentrations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in the Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no prot@@ eas@@ ants , even after 48 weeks under A@@ gener@@ ase more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml as among placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ously decreased also the Vir@@ us@@ last but with the children who were previously treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , very few to the treatment mentioned earlier . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , who were previously treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , this was just as effective with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased medicinal herb for 16 @-@ week treatment as well as other prot@@ eas@@ ants : &quot;
&quot; in the patient with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ eas@@ ants , it came under A@@ gener@@ ously along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who continued their previous protein @-@ offs : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ously ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , Flat@@ sea ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , skin rash and Fatima &apos;s ( ti@@ redness ) . &quot;
&quot; 2 / 3 A@@ gener@@ acy should not be applied in patients , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ rant of St. John ( a herbal supplement for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as equivalent to gener@@ ously and in high concentrations in the blood are detrimental to health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines to HIV , there are patients who are A@@ gener@@ acy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , a oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose ( abnorm@@ alities of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activ@@ ating syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of infection , which are caused by the reco@@ vering immune system ) . &quot;
the committee for human therapeutic medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ als in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken along with the pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic amplifier t@@ amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefits of A@@ gener@@ asis in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously not taken any prot@@ eas@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because at the time of approval for scientific reasons only limited information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission adopted the Gla@@ xo Group Limited a licence for the transport of A@@ gener@@ acy across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children older than 4 years . &quot;
&quot; for usual , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are to be administered for pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r should be carried out under consideration of the individual viral pesti@@ cide , and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 600 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
the phar@@ yn@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , effectiveness and safety of as@@ gener@@ ously in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ eas@@ ants were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to the lack of data relating to un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose should be reduced to A@@ gener@@ ously capsules with adult patients with moderate @-@ weight liver disorder at 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be performed with caution when patients with mild or moderate liver disorder , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ously may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have low therapeutic width , and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) may not be applied due to the risk reduction in plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r during the intake of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with aging , does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for usual , A@@ gener@@ als are to be applied along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy have increased risk of severe liver effects with potentially deadly course .
&quot; for the case of simultaneous anti@@ viral therapy of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant technical information on this medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients with existing restricted liver function , including chronic hepatitis , show an increased frequency of liver dys@@ functions under an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ ko@@ ids , which switches over C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended , unless the potential benefits of treatment risk the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or strongly depends on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , an simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ously with Lov@@ ast@@ ine and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ op@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines causing serious or viable side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the active drug . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ asy can be less effective because of reduced plasma bars in Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive can be changed , however the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ejo symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of risk of toxicity , it is contra@@ indicated because of the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ ates in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be reduced to duration 5 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ gs are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who received a anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including protein @-@ previously , was reported on the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an extern@@ er@@ cion of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other disorders required for their therapy medicines which are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with drug addic@@ ted factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ com@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , there are reports of a rise of bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; in treating HIV infected patients with severe immune defect can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections , which results in severe clinical trials or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi @-@ fac@@ torial equ@@ ino@@ ology is accepted ( including the application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids , alcohol consumption , heavy immune response , higher body Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ o@@ ek@@ rose particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width of gener@@ ously may not be given simultaneously with medicines which have a low therapeutic width and also sub@@ str@@ ates sub@@ str@@ ates of the cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 sub@@ str@@ ates with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ously with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r should not be given together with pharmaceuticals whose active ingredients are predominantly associated with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plasma bars with heavy and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it has been demonstrated that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in was caused by a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to equi@@ p the lower plasma bars by a dosage increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , have been observed very frequently unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um mirror of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r can be humili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of herbal preparations with cur@@ rant ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already inser@@ ting St. John &apos;s Wort , the spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r@@ mirror are and , if possible , to check the Vir@@ us@@ last and we@@ ave the cur@@ rant . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not necessary if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , doses of 600 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r have been applied twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , which occupy the effectiveness and un@@ thin@@ ility of this treatment schem@@ at@@ as . &quot;
52 % lower if Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg / w@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) was administered twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached in combination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a me@@ tering recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ etra can not be given , however , there is however a eng@@ masch@@ ige surveillance recommended as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic study performed for use of gener@@ ational in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine , however , is recommended due to the fanta@@ sies component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenue of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ ine and A@@ gener@@ als are apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , when gift from E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) No dosage adjustment . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be lower .
&quot; let the effect of Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other protein @-@ previously and existing limited data can be expected , that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in the Ser@@ um@@ con@@ zentr@@ ation of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r may be lo@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plastic bars . &quot;
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , since the exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous gift of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma @-@ concentration ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at 19@@ 3 % , and thus a rise in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; phar@@ mac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with a gener@@ ational in combination with Er@@ y@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not done , however , the plasma bars of both medicines could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ l@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ene once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ene once daily to the 2.@@ 6@@ 9@@ fold compared to the value that has been observed for 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ene once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines which are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are applied together with A@@ gener@@ acy , possibly to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be based on toxic reactions , which are associated with these drugs , when they are used in combination with gases . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ eas@@ ers , it is advisable that An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da do not be taken at the same time as ather@@ proof as it can come to remn@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti @-@ con@@ vul@@ ses that are known as an enzyme phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r can lead to a humili@@ ation of plas@@ m@@ asp@@ al@@ ants from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ block@@ ade , such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Cher@@ ni@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin ,
&quot; simultaneous intake with aging can increase their plasma @-@ concentrations and increase with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in the Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) over 7 days at Pro@@ ban@@ al ( 4 @-@ times daily ) , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol rose approximately 86 % ( 90 % increase from 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous operation of A@@ gener@@ ously with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended with these glu@@ co@@ or@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the potential benefits of treatment risk the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oi@@ des ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A @-@ Re@@ duc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , they are expected to expect plastic bars at simultaneous administration of a general administration . &quot;
&quot; since plasma @-@ gases of these H@@ M@@ G Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ ol@@ y@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines is not recommended with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it will be recommended to more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ ze the mirror , since the plasma @-@ con@@ concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased at the same time , ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ously may not be applied together with or@@ ally registered mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while on the simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ously with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; for simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am with other pro@@ release bit@@ ors , points to a possible increase in plasma bars of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am around the 3@@ - to 4 times . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is administered along with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on O@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ejo symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the per se low reliability of historical failure , currently no recommendation is given , such as the spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose to suit , when Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ar@@ mo@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills is not pre@@ dict , therefore alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pr@@ amine and nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended for simultaneous administration of map@@ le ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied to the potential risks for the fet@@ us in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk l@@ activ@@ ating R@@ atten , Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of fatal rats that was administered by the entry into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ klu@@ ft season was shown throughout the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight at night .
the further development of the offspring including Fer@@ til@@ ity and Re@@ productive capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r to the dam .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of as@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side effects associated with the A@@ gener@@ ase treatment were slightly down to moderate , appeared early and rarely led to the treatment break . &quot;
&quot; many of these events is not clarified , whether in connection with the intake of gener@@ als or another at the same time used to treat HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; most of the people mentioned below come from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 3@@ 001 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , 1200 mg A@@ gener@@ ously received twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , employed by the test lab@@ ours as in connection with the study medication , were performed in more than 1 % of patients , as well as in the treatment of laboratory changes ( degrees 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of body fat ( lip ystro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripher@@ al and well @-@ psychoso@@ cial fatty tissue , hyper@@ trop@@ hies of breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ al fat collection . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ fit persons , who were treated with Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ dov@@ u@@ dine over a middle period of 36 weeks , was only observed one case ( Sti@@ ckers ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 stood at 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ FF ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; defects were usually mild to moder@@ ated , er@@ y@@ locking or macro @-@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and usually occurred during the second treatment week and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ le@@ vi@@ r had to be thrown down . &quot;
cases of Oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose particularly in patients with generally known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term use of anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; with HIV infected patients with severe immune defect , at the time of the introduction of an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to as@@ ymp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , the 600 mg A@@ gener@@ als were observed twice daily along with low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( degrees 3 and 4 ) which were observed under all@@ u@@ rop@@ hi@@ de@@ - and CP@@ K values , which were observed in patients , the A@@ gener@@ ously together with low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very often appeared . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 protein , thus preventing the proc@@ ession viral and g@@ ag @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ proteins in stages with the result of a formation of in@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both at acute and chron@@ ically infected i@@ onic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as on peri@@ ph@@ atter blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm in chronic infected cells
the link between the activity of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r on HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ active patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as were rarely observed in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;

&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the Isol@@ ate of 13 by 14 children , where a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure within the 59 included , with prot@@ eas@@ ants were not treated to patients , showed resili@@ ence that were similar to those in adults . &quot;

&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes through additional data , and it is recommended to always attract the current interpre@@ tations systems for analy@@ zing the results of resili@@ ent tests . &quot;
on the otyp@@ ical resili@@ ent phen@@ otype @-@ based phen@@ otype @-@ interpre@@ tations systems can be applied in conjunction with the gen@@ otype data for the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ am@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; companies , who displ@@ ac@@ ic diagnostic tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otype @-@ offs ( separ@@ ations ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied for interpretation of results of a resource test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a reduced sensitivity to Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r Associ@@ ated patterns creates a certain crus@@ ade against Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r but remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data available for cross @-@ resistance between Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ eas@@ ants for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r Res@@ ear@@ lo@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;

&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prot@@ eas@@ ants @-@ resistant isol@@ ates ; obtaining this activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the insul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the early departure of an ver@@ aging therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in borders , which can affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; the proof of the effectiveness of A@@ gener@@ ously in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , So@@ C ) with a PI , primarily with a lower Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred thre@@ e@@ fold ( n = 16@@ 3 ) patients with proven virus @-@ sensitivity to A@@ gener@@ ously , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the sub @-@ study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ superiority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the So@@ C @-@ PI group in terms of time @-@ ad@@ renal average change from output value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the Vir@@ us@@ last ( HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks in case of a non @-@ sub@@ lim@@ b threshold of 0.@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml .
the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ bund@@ led A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 2@@ 88 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years of age 152 with PI .
&quot; in the studies , a general solution for inser@@ ting and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg daily studied daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it has not been given no low endo@@ wed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s .
after 48 weeks of approximately 25 % of the patients included a plasma @-@ 1 @-@ RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml in a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the initial value .
&quot; 19 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during treatment optimisation , with PI pre @-@ treated children the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; aging . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is the average duration ( max ) to the maximum ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0,5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max on the contrary , reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is administered together with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the administration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease of AU@@ C but has no effect on the concentration of spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) .
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake affects the extent and the rate of the Res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent partition volume is approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be adjusted to a large distribution volume and an un@@ inhi@@ bited penetration of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the substance in the plasma , with the amount of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ mon@@ avi@@ r , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of the free active component during the Do@@ ady inter@@ sper@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min . &quot;
&quot; therefore medicines must indu@@ ce C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or inhi@@ bit or a sub@@ strate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ als ( see sections 4.3 , 4.@@ 4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gift of A@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg every day , leads to a similar daily Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ L@@ avi@@ r is made up of solution 14 % less bi@@ over@@ feet than from the capsules , therefore , A@@ gener@@ als solution and gases are not inter@@ changeable at a milli@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; also , the renal Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of kidney disorder is neg@@ li@@ gible to the elimination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to mon@@ kl@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ ket comparable to those who are scored in healthy com@@ ban@@ s after a dose of 1200 mg of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r twice daily without a simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on can@@ cer@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , with male animals ben@@ i@@ ato@@ id Aden@@ omas found in doses , which sp@@ ells the 2,@@ 0 @-@ times ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( rat ) of exposure to people , following twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ ato@@ genic Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on people , both in clinical trials and therapeutic applications , however , there are little evidence of accepting a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and In @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ Gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic tests , the bacterial Re@@ verse mut@@ ation tests , micro@@ k@@ ern@@ test on rats and chromos@@ ome ab@@ err@@ ation test on human temper@@ ate lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes , Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ ed nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
these liver toxicity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , clinical trials have not been observed any significant liver toxicity in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ als nor after the end of treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies for toxicity in juven@@ iles , which were treated as early as 4 days , showed both the control and the animals treated with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposure that lay significantly under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and low skel@@ etal changes affecting an delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gener@@ ase capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication supplement of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( Boo@@ stery ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase capsules is 20 mg Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the simultaneous application is to be performed with caution when patients diagnosed or lighter liver dysfunction with caution , in patients with severe liver disorder , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines causing serious or viable side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the active drug . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on duration 27 if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ gs are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an elevated risk for a pod@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with drug addic@@ ted factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it has been demonstrated that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in was caused by a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which have been reached in combination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ etra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily . &quot;
&quot; a me@@ tering recommended dosage for the simultaneous administration of am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r and cal@@ etra can not be given , however , there is however a eng@@ masch@@ ige surveillance recommended as the effectiveness and un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ ren@@ z in combination with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ eas@@ ants would be lower .
&quot; if these medicines are applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical surveillance should be made , since the exact pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is required for clinical reasons , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin should be administered together with A@@ gener@@ ase , becomes a reduction in the dosage of Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there are no clinical data . &quot;
&quot; the ser@@ um concentrations of calcium @-@ can@@ al@@ ants such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , D@@ il@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Cher@@ ni@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , Ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@

&quot; in the simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other or@@ ical anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants along with ar@@ mo@@ ase , an increased control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) is recommended because of the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Or@@ th@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg of E@@ thin@@ yl@@ est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r by 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied for the mother &apos;s possible risks to the mother in comparison to possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
a reproduction study of fatal rats that was administered by the entry into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ klu@@ ft season was shown throughout the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight at night .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of as@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose the patient is observed on signs of an in@@ toxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) , if necessary , necessary support measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both at acute and chron@@ ically infected i@@ onic cell lines ( M@@ T @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as peripher@@ al blood@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is located in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µm with acute cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µm for chronic infected cells ( 1 µm = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .

&quot; based on this data , the treatment optimisation was to be considered in compliance with PI @-@ treated children of the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; aging . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bund@@ led am@@ l@@ avi@@ r remains unchanged , the percentage of the free active component during the Do@@ ady inter@@ sper@@ ation in the Ste@@ ady state in the Ste@@ ady state across the area of C@@ max , ss up to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;

&quot; these results can be concluded that in young , the met@@ amorph@@ osis paths are still not fully mature , so Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; a generic solution for inser@@ tion is shown in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , Prot@@ eas@@ ants ( PI ) @-@ treated adults and children aged 4 years . &quot;
the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ tion was neither occupied with the PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r as a solution for inser@@ ting is 14 % lower than from Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase capsules and solution to inser@@ ting on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should be as soon as they are able to swal@@ low the capsules with taking the solution to in@@ take ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ gener@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.@@ 1 ml ) Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2@@ 800 mg spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there has to be no dosage recommendations for simultaneous application of A@@ gener@@ ase solution for inser@@ ting and low do@@ si@@ pped Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination with these patients should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment for am@@ spec@@ avi@@ r is not required for am@@ ples , an application of a gener@@ ational solution for inser@@ ting patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of high pro@@ pane gly@@ col@@ ates , A@@ gener@@ ational solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and contra@@ indicated in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
the simultaneous administration can lead to a competitive inhibit@@ ing of these medicines and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening unwanted side effects such as cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that A@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they also continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with aging , does not prevent the risk to transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines which can cause serious or viable side effects , such as car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c antidepress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the active drug . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should be placed on long duration when a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ gs are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an elevated risk for a pod@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug , 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in H@@ com@@ ophil@@ es patients ( Type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ eas@@ ants , there are reports of a rise of bleeding including spontaneous hem@@ atology and hem@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; it has been demonstrated that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in was caused by a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C of Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and lead to resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; 50@@ 8 % increase , for C@@ max on the other hand reduced by 30 % if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with spec@@ kl@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) was administered . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with aging can considerably increase their plasma @-@ concentrations in conjunction with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors in combination related side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual dys@@ functions and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are expected to increase mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am significantly higher plasma concentrations of mi@@ da@@ zol@@ am .
the potential risk for man is not known as a general problem for individuals may not be applied due to possible toxic reactions of fet@@ us on the contained prop@@ ylene gly@@ col ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk l@@ activ@@ ating R@@ atten , Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were proven , but it is not known whether Am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r is transferred to humans into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
a reproduction study of fatal rats that was administered by the entry into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ klu@@ ft season was shown throughout the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight at night .
the un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able of as@@ gen@@ ase was studied in adults and children aged 4 years in combination with different anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; many of these events is not clarified , whether in connection with the intake of gener@@ als or another at the same time used to treat HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the under@@ wear . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ active patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ kl@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as were rarely observed in other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r treatment schemes - the mut@@ ations described only rarely . &quot;
&quot; the early departure of a ver@@ aging 60 therapy is recommended to hold the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in limits , which can affect the subsequent treatment . &quot;
&quot; 62 Basi@@ cs on this data should be considered during treatment optimisation , with PI pre @-@ treated children the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; aging . &quot;
the apparent volume of distribution amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg in a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves a large c@@ ousin of c@@ ess@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissues .
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of hep@@ at@@ ato@@ genic Aden@@ omas and car@@ cin@@ ome was not yet elu@@ ci@@ dated and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; in a systemic plasma exposure that lay significantly under ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage , however , have been observed a number of minor changes including thy@@ mus and low skel@@ etal changes affecting an delayed development . &quot;

&quot; the application rigi@@ dity and the duration of the treatment with Al@@ dara depend on the treatment in the genital area . • In case of small bas@@ ins in the genital area Al@@ dara is to be applied for six weeks a week , with four weeks of break between the treatment cycles , three times weekly . &quot;
&quot; the cream is cleaned before bed@@ time thin , thin on the affected skin areas so that they remain sufficiently long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it will be washed away . &quot;
in all studies Al@@ dara was compared with a placebo ( the same cream but without the substance ) . • Al@@ dara was tested in four main studies at 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients treated with complete cooling of the treated warning . • Al@@ dara was also treated at 7@@ 24 patients with small cell disease in two studies where patients were treated six weeks and Al@@ dara or the placebo either daily or five times a week .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with complete cooling of the tum@@ ours after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dara was also tested in two studies in a total of 50@@ 5 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ants .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dara was more effective than the placebo . • At the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area was the total cooling rate of 66 % to 80 % among patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies treated to Bas@@ al@@ cell disease patients in comparison to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dara ( observed with over 1 of 10 patients ) are reactions to the use of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( AK@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o @-@ competent adults when the size or number of lesi@@ ons limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of a cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) go to bed and leave 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is so long to continue until all the visible det@@ aching in the genital or peripher@@ al sector have disappeared or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period .
&quot; any interruption with the treatment described above should be er@@ ased when intensive local inflammation occur ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) , or if in the treatment area an infection is observed . &quot;
&quot; if at follow @-@ up investigation 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the treated lesi@@ ons are only incomplete , should another therapy should be started ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; when a dose was om@@ itted , the patient sol@@ ves the cream as soon as he / she notices it and then continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is wrapped in a thin layer and inser@@ ts into the puri@@ fied , with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts infected skin @-@ area until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , there should be a breakdown of treatment associated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their autoimmune disease . &quot;
there should be a decrease in these patients between the benefits of treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rate or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host@@ esses .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ orize hygiene has been carried out , two cases were observed by severe p@@ hi@@ mos@@ is and a case with one to the circumc@@ ision of leading rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than the recommended doses , an increased risk of severe local skin irritation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases were also observed under @-@ res@@ trained use severe local skin irritation that made a treatment needed and / or led to a temporary physical impairment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occur at the outcome of the ureth@@ ra , some women had trouble passing urine , which made an emergency ca@@ the@@ ter@@ ization and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately following treatment with other cut@@ ters , for the treatment of extreme f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts in the genital and peripher@@ al area , there are so far no clinical experience . &quot;
&quot; limited data also indicate an increased rate of in@@ clin@@ ations with HIV positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group in relation to the elimination of the genital war@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of the Bas@@ al@@ cell @-@ cardi@@ ac with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , within 1 cm of the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local touch reactions are common , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions form after the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is required due to the discomfort of the patient or due to the severity of the local touch reactions , a treatment break can be made by several days . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be assessed after the regeneration of the treated skin for about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after treatment , we should consider other suitable therapy forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with relap@@ sing and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs do not present clinical experiences , therefore the application is not recommended in previously treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower chance of contact to the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of tin@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants on ey@@ eli@@ ds inside the nose or ears or on the lip range inside the lip .
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of tin@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants at anatom@@ ical places outside the face and the scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on under@@ poor and hands will not support the effectiveness in this application . therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local touch reactions are frequently occurring , but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy or go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local hood actions are causing great discomfort or very strong , treatment can be exposed for several days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical trial , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - lesi@@ ons are a smaller complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 lesi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immun@@ o@@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients who receive an immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive treatment ( see 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies , there are no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , the embryonic / feder@@ alization development , the degeneration or the post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although neither after one @-@ recurring application has been achieved after multi @-@ recurring application ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most commonly included and as probable or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related effects in trials of three weekly treatment were local reactions to the place of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) .
among the most frequently reported and as probable or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in the related side effects are discomfort of the application site with an incidence of 2@@ 8,@@ 1 % .
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream @-@ treated patients from a placebo @-@ controlled clinical trial of Phase III are shown below .
&quot; the most common , as probable , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in connection with the application of application of application ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated patients ) . &quot;
&quot; the side @-@ effects , which were specified by 25@@ 2 in plac@@ em@@ ulated clinical studies of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ cream treated patients with ak@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; these according to test plan proposed evaluation of clinical signs indicates that in these placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies with three weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently came to local touch reactions including Er@@ y@@ earning ( 30 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) , expos@@ ing / det@@ achments ( 23 % ) and oil ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; these according to test plan proposed evaluation of the clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often resulted in heavy yields ( 31 % ) , heavy ero@@ sion ( 13 % ) , and severe melt and bon@@ ding ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies for examining the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of i@@ tin ker@@ at@@ osis , Alo@@ pe@@ zie was established with an incidence of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment site or in the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental @-@ time recording of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could cause nausea , vom@@ iting , head@@ ache , My@@ al@@ gi@@ as and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically heavy side effect , which occurred after several or@@ derly doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in Hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic examination , according to the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , increased systemic concentrations of the alpha@@ bet and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine were demonstrated . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies , the effectiveness in relation to a complete ex@@ hal@@ ation of the genital war@@ ts can be clearly superior for a placebo @-@ treatment for 16 weeks of a placebo treatment . &quot;
at 60 % of the patients with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therap@@ ists healed the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts completely off ; this was 20 % of the 105 with placebo patients in the case ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete cooling could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients compared to 5 % of 16@@ 1 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) :
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od during five weeks a week over 6 weeks has been analysed in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ cell @-@ cell pul@@ ous with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; those from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that around 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) of all patients to be clin@@ ically cured and this was for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od on three weekly application in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , has been analysed in two double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic , not hyper@@ trop@@ ic AK@@ - lesi@@ ons within a related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment are@@ als on the un@@ eas@@ iness of the scal@@ p or on the face . &quot;
the single @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ ren@@ ces after one or two treatment times a recur@@ ren@@ ces of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
&quot; the approved indications of vo@@ iced f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , Ak@@ tin@@ c ker@@ at@@ ose and Super@@ mund@@ ane Bas@@ al@@ cell @-@ car@@ cin@@ oma do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dara cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind trials of children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w ) .
a minimum system intake of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly use during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest pharmaceutical concentrations in the ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amoun@@ ted to 0,@@ 1 , 0.2 and 1,6 n@@ g / ml in the application of the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 sub@@ ter@@ bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 sach@@ et ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 sach@@ et ) . &quot;
&quot; the calculated obvious half @-@ time period was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ @-@ hour half time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study , that indicates a prolonged retreat of the drug in the skin . &quot;
the data on the systemic exposure showed that the Res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was low and comparable to patients aged 6 to 12 years and comparable to healthy adults and adults with ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ mos@@ is or super@@ se@@ cular bas@@ k cell .
in a four month study for the paint toxicity in the rat introduced doses from 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg . kg too significantly reduced body weight and increased mit@@ z weight ; a run for four months carried out by the mouse and the mouse has yiel@@ ded no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice in der@@ m@@ aler agreements on three days per week induc@@ ed no tum@@ ors on the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a small systemic absorption created from the human skin and not mut@@ ations , is a risk to man due to systemic exposure to be very low . &quot;
the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice that was treated with the effective cream used earlier and in larger numbers than in the control group with reduced U@@ VR .
&quot; it can harm other people , even though these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed side effects you have considerably affected or you notice the side effects which are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor or a pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
● F@@ eig@@ war@@ ts ( Con@@ dy@@ l@@ om@@ ata ac@@ umin@@ ata ) formed on the skin in the area of the gen@@ itali@@ a ( genital organs ) and the anus ( after ) formed a frequently in@@ accurate , slow growing form of the skin cancer with very low probability of the spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; if it remains un@@ treated , it can lead to explor@@ ations , especially in the face - therefore is early detection and - treatment important . &quot;
Ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants are rough areas of the skin that were among men experiencing during their past lives much of the sun @-@ radiation .
Al@@ dara should only be applied with flat acc@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ants in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dara is the most suitable treatment for you .
Al@@ dara cream supports your body &apos;s own immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to combat the superficial Bas@@ al@@ cell disease or the virus responsible for infection with genital war@@ ts .
&quot; o If you have been used earlier once Al@@ dara cream or others , similar preparations applied , please inform your doctor if you are solving problems with your immune system . o Use Al@@ dara cream only when the treatment is cured for a previous drug or surgical treatment . o A@@ void the contact with eyes , lips and nose @-@ loop . &quot;
if you accidentally touch the cream by rin@@ se with water remot@@ ely . o W@@ enden the cream in in@@ wardly an@@ .@@ o ref@@ using the cre@@ denti@@ als after the advent of Al@@ dara cream not with a band@@ age or pav@@ ement . o if reactions to the treated place occur that give you strong inconvenience , wash the cream with a mild soap and water . &quot;
once the reactions are rep@@ licated , you can continue the treatment . o Inform@@ ing your doctor if they have no normal blood picture . &quot;
&quot; if this daily cleaning is not carried out under the fores@@ kin , it can be calculated with increased appearance of pre @-@ skin swelling , fertili@@ zers of the skin or difficulties when re@@ traction of the fores@@ kin . &quot;
&quot; do not apply Al@@ dara cream in the ureth@@ ra ( ureth@@ ra ) , in the vagina ( vagina ) , the cervi@@ x ( cervi@@ x ) or inside the anus ( after ) . &quot;
taking other drugs have serious problems with your immune system should you use this medication for no more than one treatment cycle .
if you have ejac@@ ulated during the infection with genital war@@ ts in the genital area is the treatment with Al@@ dara cream after sexual intercourse ( not beforehand ) .
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you apply other medicines or have recently applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; satisfy your inf@@ ant during the treatment with Al@@ dara cream , as not known whether I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od came into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; the frequency and duration of the treatment are different with f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts , Bas@@ al@@ cell and ak@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ osis ( see specific instructions for each application area ) . &quot;
&quot; wear a thin layer Al@@ dara cream on the clean , dry skin place with the f@@ eig@@ war@@ ts and prescri@@ be the cream carefully on the skin until the cream is completely covered . &quot;
&quot; men with genital war@@ ts under the fores@@ kin must pull the fores@@ kin every day and wash the skin area beneath it ( see section 2 &quot; What do you need to consider before using Al@@ dara cream ? &quot; ) . &quot;
please talk to your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have the impression that the effect of Al@@ dara is too strong or too weak .
&quot; for 6 weeks a week , 5 days a week , a sufficient amount of Al@@ dara cream are applied to cover the affected area and 1 cm around this area . &quot;

inform your doctor / your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist / your pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel at ease during the application of Al@@ dara cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acted to the treatment with Al@@ dara cream , you should not use the cream to keep the skin area with water and a mild soap to wash and your doctor or your pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a humili@@ ated number of blood cell can make you more suscep@@ tible for infections ; it can cause that with you faster a blue stain is created or she can cause damage .
&quot; inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you have considerably affected or you notice the side effects which are not stated in this use information . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can feel Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the fields that you have applied Al@@ dara cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , it is about lighter plug @-@ actions that will be able to re @-@ sound within approximately 2 weeks after dismantling the treatment . &quot;
&quot; occasionally , some patients notice changes at the application site ( W@@ und@@ el@@ t , inflammation , swelling , mold , bladder , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is applied to the enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I ; α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase lack ) to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( symptoms which are not associated with brain or nerves in connection ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ co@@ es , g@@ ags ) will not be eliminated and thus accum@@ ulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; following not neurological symptoms of M@@ PS I can occur : increased liver , sti@@ ff joints , the movements make ag@@ grav@@ ated , dimin@@ ished lung volume , cardi@@ ac and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be in a hospital or clinic with recur@@ ve equipment and patients need appropriate medicines to prevent an allergic reaction .

&quot; in the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , however , it was also measured by its effectiveness ( by examining its effect with regard to reducing gases concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
in children under the age of five Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine around 60 % and half of the treated children referred to a normal big liver at the end of the study .
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ ache , nausea , abdom@@ inal pain , ar@@ thro@@ al@@ ry ( joint pain ) , pain pain , pain and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under the age of five are increased blood pressure , reduced oxygen temperature ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and s@@ ut@@ ch@@ fro@@ st . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may be used in patients who may possibly highly hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other ingredients ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction ) not to be applied .
&quot; the European Drugs Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will be published every year all new information , which may well be known , and to update this summary . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is received patients , the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding the reactions to the in@@ fusion and the development of antibodies . &quot;
June 2003 the European Commission adopted the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. for approval of the transport of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology under the use of CH@@ O @-@ mam@@ mal cell@@ ar@@ omas ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ arian of the Chinese ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is a long @-@ term enzymes in patients with secure diagnosis of a Mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ ot I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase lack ) contra@@ indicated to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased if the patient carries it all 15 minutes in single steps on a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years of age has not been determined and for these patients no mechan@@ ization can be recommended .
the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suffici@@ ency has not been determined and for these patients no mechan@@ ization can be recommended .
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me infected patients may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which are defined as any associated side effect , which occurs during in@@ fusion or by the end of the in@@ fusion effect ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should be monitored carefully and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment , in the rehabilitation facilities for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies form against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months from treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; since there is little experience regarding the resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , must be cautious due to the theoretical risk of a hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an interruption of the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( Anti @-@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or Anti @-@ Py@@ re@@ tika ) to be treated to minimize the potential in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be er@@ ased and / or a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at half of the in@@ fusion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , heavy in@@ fusion reaction , in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms are brought to decrease , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is considering . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ op@@ hen / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids ) as well as a reduction in in@@ fusion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the pre @-@ balanced reaction occurred .
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or Proc@@ ain because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
&quot; experimental studies do not leave directly or indirect effects on the pregnancy , the embryonic development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which have grown expon@@ entially from the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended to satisfy the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
side @-@ effects in clinical studies were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are observed at 53 % of patients in phase 3 study ( treatment duration up to 4 years ) and at 35 % of patients in the study involving participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) were observed .
&quot; unwanted pharmaceutical interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were observed during phase 3 and their extension at a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during treatment duration of up to 4 years , are listed in the following table following the following frequencies : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) ; frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related participation of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre @-@ history , there appeared heavy reactions to , including bron@@ chi@@ os@@ pas@@ mus , breathing still@@ s and facial oils ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children un@@ wished pharmaceutical impacts related to Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged 5 years , with mainly severe exercise form and a treatment duration up to 12 months , reported are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients it occurred within 3 months after the start of the treatment , with a severe exercise form , usually within one month at an Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version ( average after 26 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or up to a premature departure from the study ) , with 13 / 45 patients were unable to veri@@ fiable antibodies , including 3 patients , in which there had never been Ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with lack of antibodies to the lower level of antibodies have been a robust reduction in the gel mirror in the har@@ n while in patients with high anti@@ body ti@@ tres was a variable reduction in G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally until low @-@ neutral inhibit@@ ors impact on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vit@@ ro which seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or reducing G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
&quot; the presence of antibodies seemed not to stand in connection with the incidence of unwanted drug actions , although the appearance of unwanted drug actions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reasoning for the enzyme all@@ ot@@ ation is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ strate and the prevention of a further accumulation of sufficient recovery of the enzymes .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly absorbed from the circulation and cells into the Ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms were investigated in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , plac@@ eable phase 3 study of 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited to study the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients were from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient opposed the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had an for@@ ci@@ ated exp@@ ir@@ atorial volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute walking distance in the 6 @-@ Min@@ ut@@ or secret test .
all patients were recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label registry study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) every week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me to improve the lung function and the ability to improve the treatment in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and of 182 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group , as emerged from the following table . &quot;
the decrease of the percentage of the percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period and the total capacity of pneum@@ a rose further in proportion to the height of growing children .
from 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size .
&quot; within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) has been fixed , which remained consistent until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; regarding the hetero@@ genic disease activity between patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point ( to expect the clinical significant improvement for five efficacy ratio , the scope of school ter@@ gel@@ en@@ ks AH@@ A and visual acu@@ ity ) , was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which mainly the safety and pharmaceutical o@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me was examined in 20 patients who were at the time of their intake in the study under 5 years of age ( 16 patients with severe exercise form and 4 with the middle of the writing ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased because of increased GA@@ G@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 over the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) has been found after the Z @-@ score for this age group . the younger patients with the severe exercise form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and every 4 patients with the severe exercise form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe ev@@ ac@@ uation , were only limited , or no advances in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a Phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of different Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ Do@@ ning schem@@ ata were conducted on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the Har@@ n , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute wal@@ test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the Do@@ ge scheme with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can be present in patients who have difficulty with weekly inser@@ ts , a reasonable alternative ; however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two Do@@ ors schem@@ ata is equivalent . &quot;
&quot; the European Medi@@ c@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will evaluate any new information that will be available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the drug will be updated . &quot;

the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ bo@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in can@@ cer@@ ous cells than in healthy cells that leads to higher concentrations in the active form of the drug and a longer active time in cancer cells .
for the treatment of the Mali@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who previously had not received chemotherapy against their disease .
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were treated in 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease , which previously had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another drug against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , and in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients , who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;

patients must also receive an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular inj@@ ecting vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 m@@ c@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage as well as according to any third payment cycle .
&quot; in patients who receive P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , should be created before each gift a complete blood@@ shot - the , including a differentiation of the leu@@ co@@ cy@@ tes and a thro@@ mbo@@ genic . &quot;
alkal@@ ine phosph@@ or@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ame @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Alan@@ in @-@ Trans@@ amine ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be a &lt; 3 @-@ fold of the upper limit value . &quot;
at the beginning of a new treatment cycle there must be a dosage check @-@ examination of the N@@ adi@@ r &apos;s blood picture or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity of the pre@@ - h@@ itting therapeutic cycles .
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the information in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are used for AL@@ IM@@ TA as a Mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Market C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degrees 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop no @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity for degree 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the therapy must be interrupted by AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value in front of the treatment . &quot;
the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA has to be termin@@ ated if in patients after 2 years of dose or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ ological toxicity or non @-@ hä@@ mat@@ ological toxicity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - continued with the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies have no indication that in patients aged 65 years of age or compared to patients aged under 65 years of age is an increased risk @-@ effective risk .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to not sufficient data for un@@ obj@@ ection@@ able and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical studies in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , no dosage adap@@ tations needed to go beyond the dosage adap@@ tations for all patients . &quot;
the data base in patients with a cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver functional increase of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper b@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ - bor@@ der@@ land and / or trans@@ amin@@ as@@ en@@ vision of &gt; the 3.@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper limit value ( in cases of liver metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 times of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metastatic ) not specifically examined in trials . &quot;
patients must be monitored with regard to the Kno@@ od@@ chen@@ mark@@ ers and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administered up to patients before the absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ or@@ le has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ mbo@@ genic hormones can reach a value of over 100,000 persons / mm ³ . &quot;
a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ or@@ ised number that has been observed in the preceding treatment cycles - the ( see section 4.2 ) .
a lower toxicity and a reduction of degree 3 / 4 hä@@ mat@@ ological and ni@@ ch@@ th@@ mat@@ ological toxicity such as ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degree 3 / 4 ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was desp@@ ised if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place .
&quot; therefore , all patients must be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as prophy@@ l@@ actic measure for reduction treatment conditions ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to moderate kidney failure ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine @-@ clearing ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ ates ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and reduction - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , intended for treatment with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid ing@@ esting N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ time period for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients , in which these events occurred , corresponding risk factors for the occurrence of renal events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , predomin@@ ant blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
therefore in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space a dra@@ in@@ age of the result would be wei@@ ghed in front of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment .
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dio infections , and cer@@ eb@@ rov@@ as@@ cular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic drug . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ dant circumstances ( except yellow fever , this vaccine is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irreversible damage - the reproductive capacity is fixed by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before treatment - g@@ ush out to obtain advice regarding sperm conservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses can cause ast@@ ero@@ id anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ei@@ c acid ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 g. daily ) and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid in higher dos@@ ages ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ fraction exec@@ utable with the result of a increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is advisable when in patients with normal kidney function ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or acet@@ yl@@ ic@@ yl@@ acid can be applied in high dosage . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the treatment , on the day of therapy and reduction - T@@ ens 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there is no data regarding the promotion potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ value like Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ oxi@@ des , the simultaneous application must be fixed for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the scent status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ality rati@@ o ) if the decision was taken to treat the patient with or@@ derly anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed at pregnant women , but as with anti @-@ established an@@ tim@@ es@@ ol@@ ites are expected with an application in pregnancy severe birth defects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed may not be applied during pregnancy , except if strictly fatigue and after careful control of the farm for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irreversible damage to the reproductive capacity is fixed by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be pointed out before the treatment course , consultations with regard to the sperm count . &quot;

in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 with placebo .
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 patients , the All@@ i 60 mg received , after one year , an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg can be recorded , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;

the likelihood of occurrence of astro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if alli is taken along with a fat @-@ fat or obes@@ e nutrition .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes may be associated with improved metabolic control , patients should consult a medicine against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli gains a doctor or pharmac@@ ist , because the dosage of anti@@ diabe@@ tic can be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who are accredited as well as medicines for high blood pressure or increased cholesterol levels should ask their physician or pharmac@@ ist if the dosage needs to be adapted .
&quot; it is recommended to meet additional fluctu@@ ations , in order to prevent the contrac@@ eption of oral contrac@@ eption in case of serious diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of drugs and in several cases with the simultaneous application of Or@@ list@@ at and Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in was observed a lowering of the Cic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma bars .

&quot; in most patients , who have been treated in clinical studies up to 4 full years with Or@@ list@@ at , the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as the beta @-@ carot@@ ene remained in normal . &quot;
&quot; however , the patient should be advised to take a supple@@ mentary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement in order to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the gift of a Ein@@ mal@@ d@@ osis Ami@@ o@@ dar@@ on , has been observed at a limited number of volunteers , who at the same time received Or@@ list@@ at , a slight decrease in the Ami@@ o@@ gut @-@ Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embryonic development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
the side effects of Or@@ list@@ at are mainly due to astro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented .
&quot; the g@@ astro@@ intestinal side effects have been determined from clinical studies with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years , and were generally light and temporary . &quot;
&quot; the frequencies are defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , and very rarely ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency on the basis of the data available ) . &quot;
&quot; frequency of well @-@ known side effects which were noted after the market launch of Or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of irregular size . &quot;

&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch reported cases by Or@@ list@@ at @-@ Over@@ do@@ tization , either side effects or similar side effects were reported at the recommended dose of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on humans and animals can be proce@@ eded from a fast re@@ formation of systemic effects , which are due to the li@@ pass@@ able properties of Or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
the therapeutic effect sets in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper intest@@ ine through kov@@ al@@ ente to the active Ser@@ in @-@ Rest of ga@@ str@@ ands and pan@@ atic Li@@ pas@@ en .
&quot; from clinical studies has been derived that 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food intake . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , plac@@ eable studies of adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 monitor the effectiveness of 60 mg of Or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times daily in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ or@@ phic , fet@@ al nutrition . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ ization ) , has been assessed as follows : as a change of body weight in the course of course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those students that have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction was observed over 12 months , the maximum weight loss appeared in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average change in the overall cholester@@ in was with Or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.2 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.@@ 8 % ( output worth 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

when compared to Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on these values were at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 from 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
March 2005 announced the European Commission of Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd. approved for approval by Alo@@ xi across the European Union .
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute sickness and vom@@ iting in strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease and prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer disease .
the effectiveness of alo@@ xi to the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting which is induc@@ ed by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy may be enhanced by adding one prior to chemotherapy given Cor@@ ti@@ co@@ stero@@ ids .
&quot; da Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can extend the dick@@ head age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ tate ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a subtle i@@ le@@ us according to the injection . &quot;
&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T interval or with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval can be extended or which tend to be such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with another chemical physi@@ otherapeu@@ tics , alo@@ xi in the days after chemotherapy is neither for prevention nor for the treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in pre@@ clinical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ otic , the against tum@@ ors of the five studied chemical physi@@ otherap@@ ists ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cy@@ clo@@ ister , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ - concentration or@@ alen Met@@ oc@@ lo@@ bla@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ d@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; in a population based on a population based pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ duc@@ tors ( D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ one and Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , mar@@ in@@ avi@@ din , cro@@ ig@@ al@@ in and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) have had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ otic . &quot;
&quot; experience for applying Pal@@ on@@ otic tron in human pregnancy is not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ otic tron should not be applied in pregnant women , unless it is necessary from the treating doctor as necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams of observing side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least could possibly be associated with alo@@ xi , headaches ( 9 % ) and Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitive reactions and reactions to the deadline ( burning , curing , discomfort and sor@@ eness ) were stated in post marketing experiences . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequencies showed itself similar to unwanted events such as in the other Do@@ ors @-@ groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
no di@@ aly@@ sis studies carried out due to large distribution volume is a di@@ aly@@ sis however probably no effective therapy in an alo@@ xi@@ an over@@ dose .
&quot; in two random@@ ized double @-@ blind studies were received a total of 1,@@ 132 patients , which received a moder@@ ately plan@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with &lt; 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ op@@ l@@ atin , with patients compared to 32 mg / m2 ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) , or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on ( half @-@ time 4 hours )

results of the studies with moder@@ em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study with strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies for indications of chemotherapy induc@@ ed nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c @-@ Inter@@ v@@ alls with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ se@@ tron and Dol@@ as@@ etr@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to the findings of pre @-@ clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron has the ability to block the icon &apos;s v@@ entri@@ cular De@@ - and Re@@ pol@@ arization and extend the length of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the trial in 221 healthy Pro@@ ban@@ s carried out was the assessment of the E@@ KG @-@ Eff@@ ect@@ onic Pal@@ on@@ ose@@ tron in single @-@ p@@ ants of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2,@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; the Res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows a slow elimination of the body with an average time period of about 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma @-@ concentration ( C@@ max ) and the area under the time @-@ time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally within the entire Dos@@ age range of 0.@@ 3@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients dos@@ ages .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous gift of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron 0,@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean size ( ± SD ) increase in Pal@@ on@@ otic tron Plas@@ ma@@ con@@ centric at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ o@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that once a daily intraven@@ ous administration of 0,@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ otic tron on 3 consecutive days reached overall tex@@ tual administration of 0.@@ 75 mg total value ; however , the C@@ max after the introduction of 0.@@ 75 mg was higher . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated over the kidneys and approximately additional 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ amorph@@ oses which compared to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron over less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recep@@ tor .
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro trials for met@@ alli@@ zation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a lesser extent , the I@@ so@@ ils C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 has been involved in the met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ otic tron . &quot;
&quot; after a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; Pal@@ on@@ otic , about 80 % of the dose were found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ otic tron made an un@@ altered ingredient in about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
after a unique intraven@@ ous fixing object for healthy was the total body of 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the renal Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min .
&quot; while in patients with severe liver disorder , the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al@@ b@@ ent@@ age and the average systemic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ otic tron increases , reducing the dose is thus not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies have been observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered adequate above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , indicating a low relevance to clinical use . &quot;
10 of pre@@ clinical studies revealed that Pal@@ on@@ otic tron can only be blocking in very high concentrations of I@@ on@@ en@@ can@@ als who are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and prec@@ polar@@ isation and can extend the action for action .
&quot; high doses Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ( each dose was given in about the 30@@ fold of the therapeutic exposure to people ) that were given daily over two years , led to a increased frequency of liver tum@@ ors , endo@@ cr@@ ine , pancre@@ atic , pancre@@ atic tum@@ ours in rats , but not on mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not completely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi determines a unique application , the relevance of these results is neg@@ atively evaluated . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the holder of this permit is to bring the European Commission to inform the plans of the establishment of the drug within the framework of this decision . &quot;
&quot; • If any of the listed side effects you have considerably affected or you notice the side effects which are not stated in this use information , please inform your doctor . &quot;
&quot; • Alo@@ xi is a clear , color@@ less inj@@ ecting solution to inj@@ ecting a V@@ ene . • The drug ( Pal@@ on@@ otic tron ) belongs to a group of medicines that can cause nausea and vom@@ iting . • Alo@@ xi is used to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting that may occur in connection with chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;

June 2006 the Committee for Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) adopted a negative expertise in which the approval of the approval for the treatment of hepatitis C has been advised for the treatment of hepatitis C with Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injections .
&quot; this means that Al@@ ph@@ eon a biological medicine called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , with the same pharmac@@ eu@@ ble effective part , which is already approved in the EU ( also &quot; &quot; reference bi@@ ases &quot; ) . &quot;
Al@@ ph@@ eon should be used for the treatment of adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ lasting ) hepatitis C ( one through a viral infection ) .
&quot; with a micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic examination , the liver tissue points out , furthermore the values of the liver en@@ ary alan@@ ine Amin@@ o s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) increases in the blood level . &quot;
it is produced by a yeast into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced to this to the formation of the substance .
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon submitted data to cover the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the drug , active mode , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to 4@@ 55 patients with the effectiveness of the reference treatment . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after hi@@ ring the treatment to the medication ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; furthermore , concerns were expressly indicated that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug could not be inadequate . &quot;
the number of patients infected with hepatitis C in the treatment of Al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after hi@@ ring the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon fl@@ amm@@ ers , the disease can be returned to more patients than with the reference practitioner ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ eon had more side @-@ effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , the test carried out in the study was analysed how far the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - specific proteins - against the drug ) dis@@ sol@@ ves , not adequately vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it may be applied to the treatment of Im@@ peti@@ go ( one with cru@@ sten@@ osis ) and small in@@ trin@@ si@@ fications ( cr@@ acking or chi@@ ves ) , de@@ allo@@ wan@@ ces , and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that were det@@ ectable or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in@@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go is not working against these kinds of infections .
Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients starting from nine months of age but patients under the age of 18 should not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface .
&quot; if the patient does not address the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ oms ( the parts of the bacter@@ i@@ enz@@ elle in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of the efficacy was reported in all five studies of the percentage of patients whose infection was stopped after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.@@ 1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo for the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected bon@@ tw@@ o@@ ds , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ ex@@ in similar contact rates : if the results of both studies were taken together in touch customers , about 90 % of the patients of both groups spoke to treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was caused in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( eit@@ ed cav@@ ity in the body tissue ) or by infections that were demonstr@@ ably or presumably caused by MR@@ SA , not effective enough . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irritation of the order .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go during short @-@ time treatment of the following superficial skin infections towards the risks were predomin@@ ant : • Im@@ dal , • in@@ fied little la@@ undering , sc@@ atter@@ ing or se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Ltd. has appro@@ ving approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; patients , where no improvement can be considered within two to three days , are to be investigated once and an alternative treatment should be considered ( see section 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tizing or severe local irritation by using Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be , the treatment is interrupted that the anoin@@ ting has been carefully checked and an adequate alternative treatment of the infection can be started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin shall not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known as patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; clinical trials at secondary un@@ tested open wounds was the effectiveness of re@@ am@@ ulin gene in patients with infections , which were caused by a meth@@ ane @-@ resistant st@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , in@@ sufficiently . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 2 @-@ day treatment no improvement or worsen@@ ing of the infected place occurs .
the impact of the simultaneous application of re@@ am@@ ine and other topical methods on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical drugs is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma con@@ centric , which have been reached by people based on topical skin or infected superficial wounds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhi@@ ation in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
3 After simultaneous mixing of 2 @-@ times daily 200 mg K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ene increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ max after top@@ ographic application of 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be on the under@@ side skin of healthy adult men by 81 % .
&quot; due to the low system of systemic exposure to topical application in patients dos@@ is@@ adap@@ tations are not required , if topical re@@ am@@ ulin used during a systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have demonstrated a reproduction according to oral intake and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and the post@@ tale / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be applied during pregnancy , if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly inde@@ xed and the application of re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin gene to the gift of a systemic antibiotic is prefer@@ able . &quot;
when deciding whether the breastfeeding has continued / ended or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be termin@@ ated between the benefits of breastfeeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefits of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials at 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was applied , the most commonly reported on @-@ effect irritation during the date of arrival , which looked about 1 % of patients . &quot;
mode Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic derivatives of leu@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin a substance caused by fer@@ mentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pas@@ se@@ ck@@ eri@@ anus ) .
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on the selective protagonist of bacterial protein synthesis by inter@@ acting on a specific branch of the 50@@ s sub @-@ unit of the bacterial Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differ from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial fabrics .
data indicate that the binary protein Protein L@@ 3 is involved and located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ bin@@ aries and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ centre .
&quot; by attachment to this bond point inhibit@@ ing P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer , block partial P @-@ bin@@ dings inter@@ actions and prevent the normal education active 50@@ s ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should be applied on the basis of the local prevalence of resistance to the application of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in at least some infectious forms , should be pursued a consultation by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in the In @-@ vit@@ ro activity from Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin towards S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the insul@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ icillin . &quot;
&quot; in the event of non @-@ response to the treatment of S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of tribes should be considered with additional viral agent ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton Valentine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;
Res@@ or@@ ption In a study involving healthy adults was brought 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be daily with oc@@ clu@@ sion on intact and secluded skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; from 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , the 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ine Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days at the topical treatment of secondary infected wounds were obtained single plas@@ m@@ wood . &quot;
the sample payment took place in the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients in front of the medication and in the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
however the maximum individual system intake of people after topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 s@@ worn skin ( C@@ max = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for the P@@ GP .
&quot; met@@ abol@@ ism The in vit@@ ro oxid@@ ative met@@ abol@@ ism of ret@@ ali@@ am@@ ine in human liver micro@@ som@@ en was primarily im@@ par@@ ted by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , under minor participation of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies concerning or@@ derly toxicity in rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) , which were conducted over 14 days , there were signs of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid . &quot;

&quot; when the Sal@@ be from hides at one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice , if complaints occur . &quot;

Ambi@@ ence is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases that affect the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 years that are not im@@ mu@@ te against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is used within two doses of existing vaccines where protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix should only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and it is ensured that the vaccine will be led to an end from two doses . &quot;
if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B may be prescribed , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis A@@ - or -@@ B vaccine may be given . &quot;
vaccines work by bringing it to the immune system ( the natural resistance of the body ) as it can defend against a disease .
&quot; once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognises the viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and generates anti@@ body antibodies . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as the vaccines approved since 1996 and has been approved in the treatment of Twin@@ rix Children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to the protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix is administered adults and Twin@@ rix children within the framework of one out of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix uses identical ingredients , some of the data , which support the application of Twin@@ rix adults , also as test@@ ings used for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of the effectiveness was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective anti@@ body anti@@ body .
in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children the effectiveness of the vaccine was compared to six months and a 12 @-@ month gap between the two injections .
Ambi@@ rix had led to between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies to hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix had similar to a six @-@ month gap between the injections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with over 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are head@@ ache , loss of appetite , pain at the inj@@ ecting location , redness , Mat@@ ter ( fatigue ) as well as irritation . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may not respond to patients who may possibly hyper@@ sensi@@ tively ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 divided the European Commission for Gla@@ x@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ c@@ als s.@@ a. a permit for the transport of Ambi@@ rix in total
&quot; the stand@@ ardis@@ ed Plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ hed chim@@ eric would be desired for hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B , with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis A ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) anti@@ fung@@ al ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and Anti @-@ hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HA@@ V ) antibodies are in the same size order as after vaccination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet secured , whether immun@@ o @-@ competent individuals who have addressed to a hepatitis A@@ - vaccine because they may also be protected with no more det@@ ectable antibodies perhaps by the immun@@ ological memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all injections should be available in the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ l@@ actic reaction after the gift of the vaccine , corresponding possibilities for medical treatment and supervision should always be available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is recommended , the stand@@ ardis@@ ed scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ated hepatitis @-@ B surface . &quot;
&quot; at hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis and persons with disorders of the immune system , according to the pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization under circumstances , no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs anti@@ body is achieved so that in these cases , the Gift of other vaccines can be required . &quot;
since an intra@@ oral inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the but@@ tery muscle could lead to an optimal imp@@ licate success that these injections should be avoided .
&quot; in case of Th@@ ro@@ ism or blood @-@ ag@@ grav@@ ating disorders , Ambi@@ ence can be in@@ compar@@ atively in@@ tim@@ ated as sub@@ cut@@ aneous as it can occur in these cases after in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift to bleeding . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix had administered in the second life year in the form of a separate injection ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or combined with a combined mas@@ ap@@ - m@@ umps tube vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients suffering from immun@@ os@@ up@@ pressive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it must be assumed that no adequate immune response is achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was carried out with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation in adults , was the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , carp@@ entry , head@@ ache and fever comparable to the frequency which was observed in the earlier thick and preser@@ vatives . &quot;
in clinical studies 20@@ 29 ino@@ d@@ ants Ambi@@ rix were administered at a total of 10@@ 27 vaccines at the age of 1 to 15 years .
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ doses combined with that of 3 @-@ doses . &quot;
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and irrit@@ ability on a calculation base per vaccination up@@ osis , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain has been observed after the Gift of Ambi@@ rix with 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in proportion , compared to the gift of a dose of 3 @-@ doses recommended dosage . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vaccination @-@ cycle reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the subjects , the Ambi@@ rix had administered to over pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % among the subjects that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - Com@@ bin@@ ed vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mats was compared to high ( i.e. over the whole vaccine in 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the group , the Ambi@@ rix received , compared to 3@@ 6.@@ 2 % of the subjects , which received the 3 @-@ doses @-@ Com@@ bin@@ ed vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of reported ache and mat@@ ozo@@ a was minor and comparable to that observed after administration of the combin@@ i vaccine with the 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ scheme .
in a comparative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year vacc@@ inations was the occurrence of local interactions and general interactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group comparable to that which was observed with the 3 @-@ doses combined with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
&quot; in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - olds , however , after vaccination with Ambi@@ rix was a more common occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per Pro@@ band . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ inations , which reported about severe side effects during the 2 @-@ doses vaccines with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ doses vaccines with the Com@@ bin@@ ed hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis @-@ A , was not different . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials which were conducted at vacc@@ inations between 1 and including 15 years , were the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the serv@@ o conver@@ sion for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.@@ 2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second , to the month 6 administered dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted during 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old , 142 two doses had been rated Ambi@@ rix and 147 the standard combined with three doses . &quot;
&quot; with the 2@@ 89 people whose immun@@ o@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was ex@@ as@@ able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ infection rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 after the gift of the 3 can be significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were achieved in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ old one month after the complete vaccination series ( i.e. in the month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the vacc@@ inations were either a 2 @-@ doses vacc@@ scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ doses vacc@@ scheme with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface .
persons who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ zation between 12 and 15 years old could be detected the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies over at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in 0 @-@ 6 months vaccine .
the immune response to both anti@@ gens was comparable to that generated by vaccination of 3 doses made up of 360 ELISA units with a Com@@ bin@@ ed hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ old could be shown that the pers@@ istence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies can be compared to the immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - months vaccine .
if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix meet at the same time with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or using the first dose of a combined mas@@ king m@@ umps @-@ vaccine vaccine was the immune response to all anti@@ gens .
&quot; a clinical trial , which was conducted with 3 doses of the current wording in adults , showed the current formulation of similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ infection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence as for the earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the res@@ ignation as an eye on any external particles and / or physically visible changes to investigate .
&quot; according to Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , the state char@@ coal is made by a state laboratory or any authorized laboratory . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis @-@ A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted by other routes , such as bathing in through waste water contaminated waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ asses face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yel@@ lowing ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix can not fully protect against an infection with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus , even if the whole vaccine has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you are infected with Hepatitis C or hepatitis B virus in front of the administration of both vacc@@ in@@ ants Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or sick / feels ) a vaccination may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections , which cause the liver damage or symptoms which are similar to those of a hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B infection , cannot be im@@ par@@ ted . &quot;
• In case you have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any component of this vaccine including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by it@@ chy ras@@ hes , breathing difficulty or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have had an allergic reaction to an earlier vaccination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B . • If you / your child have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
• If you would like to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and prior to the usually planned administration of the second vaccination ) .
at a potential risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vaccination the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccination with Ambi@@ rix .
&quot; instead , he will recommend you / your child 3 injections of a combined hepatitis A / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine dosage ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ gram of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface area ) . &quot;
the second vaccine for this vaccine with reduced salary in effective components is usually administered into a month after the first dose and may give you a vaccination for your child to end the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix will suffer from individuals who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ots , under the skin and not in the muscle . • if you are di@@ mm@@ ed / your child because of a disease or treatment in your / her body &apos;s def@@ ences , or if you / your child will undergo a hem@@ i@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix could be given in these cases but the immune response of those individuals on vaccination can not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the response to the vaccine is .
&quot; 21 Sh@@ ould you take your doctor , if you / or may take other medicines or take ( including those who have been vacc@@ inated without a prescription ) or if you have given / your child recently vacc@@ inated / or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) have been administered / or this is planned in the near future . &quot;
&quot; however , it can be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as diverse as possible . &quot;
if Ambi@@ rix had administered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins it is likely that the response to the vaccine will nonetheless be sufficient .
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ rix is not administered pregnant or nursing women , except it is imperative that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A as well as hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vaccination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is available in packs to 1 and 10 with or without pins and in packs of 50 without pins .
&quot; on the basis of the data that has become familiar since the issu@@ ance of the first permission for the inspection , the CH@@ MP showed that the benefit risk for Ambi@@ rix has been positive . &quot;
&quot; since Ambi@@ rix had only been launched in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this drug is limited because of its small patient exposure . &quot;
Am@@ mon@@ aps can also be used in patients aged over a month with full enzyme disease or with hyper@@ am@@ mon@@ opo@@ ds ( brain damage as a result of high am@@ moni@@ ac@@ tion@@ ations ) in the pre @-@ history .
Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split onto several single @-@ p@@ ants to meals - swal@@ lowed under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ b@@ l@@ auch ( through the abdom@@ en into the stomach of leading hose ) or a nose ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) .
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps did not compare with another treatment or with placebo ( a head@@ lamp , i.e. without substance ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps can also result in loss of loss in blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headaches , impotence , nausea , vom@@ iting , vom@@ iting , nausea , sti@@ p@@ ation , rash , in@@ convenient body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Hum@@ anity &apos;s medicines ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps in patients with disrup@@ tions of the ur@@ inary cycle to high am@@ mon@@ ite values effectively prevented .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; extraordinary circumstances , &quot; because due to the r@@ arity of the condition there is limited information to this medicine at the time of approval . &quot;
&quot; the use is inde@@ xed to all patients , where a complete enzyme can already manifest in the newborn age ( within the first 28 life @-@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ t@@ ous form ( in@@ completed duck , which manifes@@ ts itself after the first lifetime ) , then an indication of the application when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis is a hyper@@ op@@ am@@ mon@@ e@@ al encephal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are not able to swal@@ low tablets or for patients with eggs are AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated taking into account the patient intolerance and for the growth and development of the daily protein intake .
according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as adolescents and adults .
&quot; in patients suffering from an early di@@ ous lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ or syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ av@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with an arg@@ in@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase lack must obtain arg@@ in@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be administered patients with dy@@ dys@@ functions as a risk for the emergence of an o@@ ha@@ ho@@ ha@@ y arch if the tablets do not arrive immediately to the stomach .
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should therefore be applied in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe renal in@@ suffici@@ ency , as well as with sodium re@@ per@@ ation and wast@@ age @-@ in clinical states only with caution . &quot;
&quot; because Met@@ abol@@ ization and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at over the liver and the kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied only with extreme caution in patients with liver or kidney failure . &quot;
the importance of these results in relation to pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at young rats in high dosage ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of neur@@ onal ampli@@ fication and a slo@@ wed loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; they also found a hesit@@ ant eradic@@ ation of cerebral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of the brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be as@@ certain@@ ed whether Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is out in the mother &apos;s milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at 56 % of patients at least one undes@@ irable event ( AE ) at 56 % of these undes@@ irable events was assumed that they were not connected with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old par@@ anor@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic process of metabolic disorders , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , gl@@ cy@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; a case of over@@ dose occurred at a 5 month old baby , with a daily dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) . &quot;
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed with intraven@@ ous administration of doses until 400 mg / kg / day a dose of neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabolic process that is conve@@ yed by acet@@ yl@@ ate glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine that is left over the kidneys .
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideal as an alternative carrier to ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nit@@ rogen .
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram there are sodium phen@@ yl@@ ali@@ yr@@ at between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
it is important that the diagnosis is set at an early stage and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and the clinical result .
the prognosis of the early @-@ mani@@ ac form of the disease with appearance of initial symptoms in the newborn age was almost always inf@@ ested and the disease carried out even in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ ck@@ est an@@ alo@@ ga within the first lifetime of the year .
&quot; by sc@@ et@@ aly@@ sis , the exploitation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate ) , sodium ben@@ zo@@ at and sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ ate ) , it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborn in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first phase of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rates was 100 % , but even in these patients there was time with many to mental disabilities or other neurological deficits . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a bel@@ t@@ ous form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ otic form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ av@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase deficiency ) , which were treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ein@@ ized diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
&quot; it is known that Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is co@@ ded in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ amorph@@ ous in plasma and urine have been determined by applying a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis as well as repeti@@ tive gifts of oral cans of up to 20 g / day are determined ( not controlled trials ) .
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ amorph@@ oses was also examined in cancer patients from sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral over@@ dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form , 15 minutes after ing@@ esting measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been found . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ inary drugs or hem@@ ost@@ al turbines , according to different doses of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after noc@@ tur@@ nal fasting , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma det@@ ectable . &quot;
&quot; in three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single d@@ ants ) , the middle Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma bars in the third day five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is left within 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ ish product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine through the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us tests , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non @-@ toxic cans treated rats has no cl@@ ast@@ o@@ genic effects ( examination 24 and 48 h according to oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 2@@ 800 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children , who can not swal@@ low any tablets , or patients with eggs ) or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ a or a nose . &quot;
&quot; according to the previous clinical experience the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day at new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9.@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , arg@@ in@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and ser@@ um prot@@ eine should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from an early di@@ ous lack of car@@ b@@ yl@@ phosph@@ or syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ av@@ car@@ bam@@ yl@@ ase , the substitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or arg@@ in@@ ine is required in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; if R@@ atten@@ ds were exposed before the birth of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active Met@@ abo@@ ite of Phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ) , it came to lesi@@ ons in the pyramid cells of the brain rin@@ de . &quot;
&quot; a probable toxic response to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 year old par@@ anor@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic process of metabolic disorders , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , gl@@ cy@@ top@@ ia , peripher@@ y N@@ europ@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
St@@ ö@@ chi@@ om@@ etri@@ cally seen is phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine with urea ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore ideal as an alternative carrier to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess oxygen
based on investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle can be assumed that for each gram there are sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate between 0,@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nit@@ rogen .
&quot; already existing neurological deficits are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological condition . &quot;
&quot; after an oral over@@ dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form , 15 minutes after ing@@ esting measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at have been found . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of durability , the patient can keep the finished product unique for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not over 25 ° C . &quot;
&quot; with this action , the small measuring spo@@ on is 0,@@ 95 g , the average measuring spo@@ on 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spo@@ on 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to get the drug over a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can be dissolved in water before use even in water ( the sol@@ ub@@ ility of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at amounts to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;

&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute coron@@ ary plant &quot; ( ACS , reduced blood intake to the heart ) , for example , in inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ d@@ infection ( heart attack ) without &quot; ST@@ Y &quot; ( an anom@@ aly measurement of the electro@@ cardi@@ o@@ gram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if An@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent cl@@ ots in patients , who undergo a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can contribute in patients with Ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow towards the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox for all@@ some gift , or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ or II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( GP@@ I , a different drug for preventing blood cl@@ ots ) with the conventional combination @-@ line treatment with he@@ a@@ in ( another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a GP@@ I was compared . &quot;
&quot; while PCI was often a st@@ ent ( a short tube , which remains in the arteries , in order to prevent a decision ) , and they additionally received other medicines to prevent cl@@ ots , such as ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of GP@@ I - in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attack or re@@ vas@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or one year as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from PCI , An@@ gi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators as effective as ho@@ in , except for heavy bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ a@@ in . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be applied in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against be@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , other mil@@ der or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be applied in patients who recently had a blood pressure , as well as with people with heavy hypertension or severe kidney problems or a heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ ists ( CH@@ MP ) came to the conclusion that An@@ gi@@ ox is in the treatment of ACS and during an PCI an acceptable replacement for He@@ par@@ in .
September 2004 the European Commission adopted The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd approve the approval of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union .
for the treatment of adult patients with acute coron@@ ary coron@@ ary ar@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / Non@@ - ST @-@ Heb@@ rides ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in a emergency handle or when an early intervention is planned .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us@@ hing of 0.@@ 1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another episode , an additional bolt from 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion should be increased to 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0,@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be added for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bol@@ ting of 0.5 mg / kg shall be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1,@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initial intraven@@ ous pig @-@ weight loss of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of a single Bol@@ us Gift of An@@ gi@@ ox was not studied and is not recommended , even if a short PCI procedure is planned . &quot;
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to under 225 seconds , a second bol@@ ting of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be made . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance of lower ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted medicines must be carefully mixed up before applying carefully and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis are administered rapidly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT value amounts to more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg In@@ fusion dosage is correctly administered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney operation ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to PCI ( whether with bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; is the ACT value below 225 seconds , a second bol@@ d@@ dose of 0,@@ 3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis once again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate @-@ severe kidney damage , which resulted in the Phase I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place 2 ) , included in the phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place 2 ) , included in the ACT value 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without tin @-@ adaptation at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 For patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients is An@@ gi@@ ox contra@@ indicated ( see below 4.3 ) .
the treatment with angi@@ ox can be launched 30 minutes after termination of the intraven@@ ous treatment of un@@ questionable he@@ ap@@ in or 8 hours after the end of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous gift of de@@ hydr@@ ated he@@ ap@@ partments .
• well @-@ known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other ingredients or against mil@@ u@@ dine - active bleeding or increased risk of blood due to a disorder of hem@@ ost@@ asis and / or irreversible compounds ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully given during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of a blood that is administered especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine in combination with another anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ans is administered ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even though PCI patients suffer from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , most bleeding in arter@@ ial point can occur in patients who undergo a per@@ aneous coron@@ ary coron@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , during the treatment of principle anywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine , should consider monitoring the IN@@ R value ( International Norm@@ ally rati@@ o ) to ensure that the value after the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ u@@ dine should be achieved before the treatment of existing level . &quot;
&quot; depar@@ ting from the knowledge of the active mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ ol@@ y@@ tics or Th@@ ro@@ mbo@@ cy@@ stic Dri@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these agents can increase blood danger . &quot;

&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require insulin treatment . &quot;
Ap@@ id@@ ra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdom@@ inal wall , inj@@ ected the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or as continuous in@@ fusion with a insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin in the regulation of glu@@ cos@@ es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els ( sugar ) in the blood or cannot process insulin in effect .
insulin is vast@@ ly different from human@@ ities and the change means it affects more quickly and has a shorter period of time than a short @-@ effective human@@ ization .
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra was developed in combination with an efficient insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; type 2 diabetes , where insulin is not effectively processed , Ap@@ id@@ ra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change of concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ li@@ fied hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that shows how well the blood sugar is adjusted .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , after six months a reduction of 0.2 % ( 7.@@ 60 % on 7,@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0,@@ 14 % in insulin per diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with Ap@@ id@@ ra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal levels . &quot;
&quot; Ap@@ id@@ ra may not be applied in patients who may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against insulin or any of the other components , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the cans of Ap@@ id@@ ra may need to be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines which can affect blood glucose level .
September 2004 the European Commission adopted San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ enti@@ s Germany GmbH for authorisation of the transport of Ap@@ id@@ ra in the entire European Union .
Ap@@ id@@ ra is considered sub@@ cut@@ aneous injections either in the area of the abdom@@ inal blan@@ ket or the Del@@ har@@ den@@ um or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdom@@ inal det@@ achment .
&quot; due to the decreased consumption of gluten @-@ capacity and the dimin@@ ished insulin @-@ fli@@ pping , the insulin requirement may be imp@@ aired in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of drug strength , the mark ( Her@@ - ) , of insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ izing , etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can draw a change in insulin delivery . &quot;
&quot; 3 A insufficient dosage or the demo@@ lition of a treatment , especially in patients with an insulin @-@ containing diabetes , may result in a hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and an diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ azi@@ osis ; these states are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
changing a patient to another insulin type or insulin in a different manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change of dosage necessary .
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the drug profile of the used insulin and can therefore change at the switch of the treatment schem@@ as .
&quot; to the substances that increase the blood sugar @-@ apping activity and increase the incl@@ ination to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , anti@@ fung@@ al , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , Flu@@ ox@@ etine , flu@@ ox@@ in , pro@@ po@@ xy@@ ph@@ s , s@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; additionally , under the effect of sympath@@ ies like Bet@@ ting , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , Guan@@ ac@@ id@@ ine and reser@@ pine the symptoms of the ad@@ renal colo@@ uring should be allevi@@ ated or absent . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproduction toxicity showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human@@ ities in terms of pregnancy , the embryonic development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin strikes lies in the human Mother &apos;s milk , but in general , insulin occurs either into the mother &apos;s milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;

&quot; cold @-@ silence , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , nerv@@ ousness or weakness , confusion , concentrations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive ache , nausea and cardi@@ ac kno@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ cular D@@ ystro@@ phy , the injections within the inj@@ ecting area continuously to change , may result in a sequence of a pod@@ pod@@ ystro@@ phy to the inj@@ ector . &quot;
heavy hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic with consci@@ enti@@ ousness may be treated by an in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) which is given by a doctor by a doctor or by intraven@@ ous gift of glucose .
&quot; according to a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to detect the pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ ty cause for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the peri@@ ph@@ atter glucose intake ( in particular by skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by the im@@ itation of glu@@ co@@ se@@ production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that in sub@@ cut@@ ters Ga@@ a@@ be of isl@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the action duration is shorter than in hu@@ - man@@ em normal .
&quot; in a study involving 18 male persons aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes for insulin @-@ diabetes , insulin in the therapeutic field of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0.@@ 15 E / kg showed a dis@@ proportionate increase in glucose levels , just like human@@ ities . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice that rapid impact such as normal human@@ ities and achieves the full gra@@ vi@@ fic effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human@@ ities .
&quot; from the data it was apparent that in an application of insulin treatment in 2 minutes prior to the meal , a comparable post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ ale gly@@ cem@@ ic control is achieved as with human normal levels , which is given 30 minutes before meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin was posted in 2 minutes before the meal , insulin was given a better post@@ p@@ ran@@ di@@ al control than with human normal levels , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is wasted in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , insulin is given a comparable gly@@ cem@@ ic control as in human normal levels , which is given 2 mi@@ - gro@@ o@@ ves before the meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before beginning of the meal was given earlier , 30 minutes ( normal - 30 min ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ A ) as well as compared to human normal levels , which was given 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin delivery in gift of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - after the start of the meal compared to human standards , which was 2 minutes ( normal - before ) before the start of the meal ( figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
