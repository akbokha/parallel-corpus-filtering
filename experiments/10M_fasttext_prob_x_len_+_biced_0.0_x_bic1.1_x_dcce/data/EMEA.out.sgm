<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances which allow communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripieczole appears most of all as "partial Agists" for the receptors for the neurotransmitters dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripieczole like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but appears in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytrypamine play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripieczole carries to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms, and their reappearance will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the effectiveness of Abilify, to prevent recurrence of symptoms, was examined in three studies of up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">The effectiveness of injecting treatment was compared to two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that compared to a placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify has been involved in 347 patients with Haloperdol, in another study the effectiveness of Abilify and placebo, which had been stabilized to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms have already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The effectiveness of Abilify injections was made in a study of 301 patients with bipolar disorder that was drained by Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medication) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies the change in symptoms of patients were examined by a standard scale for bipolar disorder, or the number of patients being studied in the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting, and the solution for inserting."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with injecting patients, the Abilify were received in doses of 5.25 mg, 9,75 mg or 15 mg, a significantly stronger reduction in symptoms projected anxiety than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the application of the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify has decreased in four of the five short-term studies of more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented far more effective up to 74 weeks of more effective than placebo the re-performing oral episodes in previously treated patients and if it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Abilify injections in 10- or 15-mg doses decreased also more effective than placebo the symptoms of increased anxiety and were similar to Lorazepam."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapplauding), sedation (pidation), sedation (pidation), vomiting, nautical (pation), fatigue and exhaustion (constipation), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (inobstruction), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (indifference disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">The Committee on Humanists (CHMP) came to the conclusion that the benefits of Abilify helps in the treatment of schizophrenia and from mid-severe to severe manic episode in patients who had mainly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes in the treatment with Aripieczole spoke to predominate the risks.</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injecting solution in the rapid control of gested anxiety and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in Bipolar-I disorder, if an orderly therapy is not suitable to predominate the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">In June 2004 the European Commission hosted the Company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approved for the establishment of Abilify throughout the European Union.</seg>
<seg id="28">"ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients, which had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes in the treatment with Aripieczole (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day independently of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, independent of meals as a monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients over 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initiation dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4-Inductor is set out of the combination therapy, the Aripieczole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicide behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders, and was reported in some cases after the beginning or after a change of an antipsychotic therapy, also in treatment with Aripieczole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder no increased addiction risk with Aripians is compared to other antipsychotic drugs.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripieczole should be applied with caution in patients with well known cardiovascular disease (dehydration, body insufficiency), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that may be applied to hypotony (dehydration, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure washers) or hypertonia (including akceleried and maligne form)."</seg>

<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripieczole on the central nervous system, caution is advisable when Aripieczole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central efficient drugs with itself over-level side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2-antagonist Famotidin, a stomach acid blocker, reduces the remains of Aripieczole, but this effect does not prove to be clinically relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy Probankers, a highly effective CYP2D6-Inhibitor (Chinidin) increased the AUC of Aripieczole to 107%, while the Cmax remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as Fluoxetine and paroxetine, similar effects have and therefore should have similar dose-ductions."</seg>
<seg id="52">"with CYP2D6 'bad' (=" "poor" ") Metabolisians can result in common use with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 in higher plasma concentrations of Aripieczons compared to CYP2D6 extensive Metabolism."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the common gift from Ketoconazol, or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with ABILIFY, the potential benefits should prevail to the patient's potential risks."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itractazol and HIV prorelease bitors, should have similar effects and therefore should have similar dose-ductions."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after drafting the CYP2D6- or 3A4 autobitors, the dosage should be raised by ABILIFY to the dose level before the beginning of the companion therapy."</seg>
