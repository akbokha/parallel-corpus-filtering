package &amp; package ; includes various modules for &amp; kon@@ par@@ or ; despite their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier available .
further information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ;
&quot; to load these modules in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; download settings options .... open the card details and select the desired modules . &quot;
&quot; this is a list of default modules selected using the box . please note that any more modules are on your system , if you have additional software installed . &quot;
you should install the package k@@ de@@ base that contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; includes before you compile this package .
&quot; to use the crash module , click in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; on ex@@ tras . then you can view the page , the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; for cras@@ hing , or the list of cras@@ hes , if available , delete . &quot;
the module An@@ p@@ filter ( also called folder filters ) can be reached in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under ex@@ tras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to display the DO@@ M -@@ Bau@@ x in &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; to use the DO@@ M tree ... and thus open a new window with the DO@@ M of the straight line shown . as default , the display starts with the root no@@ des of the document , example : document@@ aries , all other knot@@ s are sub@@ elements of this root . &quot;
the module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view of objects with the M@@ IM@@ E @-@ type I@@ node / directory with local files . it can be used as an alternative for the different symbols and text views to ensure the content of your local file system .
&quot; the peculi@@ arity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists of depic@@ ting folder hierarch@@ ies with the help of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map graphi@@ cally . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface must be proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the sizes of the sub@@ ordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object . &quot;
&quot; &amp; FS@@ View ; reflects the size of a file or folder , whereas the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files , even then can be easily detected , if they are far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphic and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you will be considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View ; an entry in the staircase is a rect@@ angle , which represents a file or a folder in your fil@@ esystem . for simpler navigation , the rectangular area feature meaningful colour toler@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched on color mode , can be either depth for the slight detection of the in@@ toxic@@ ation or the illustration of another file , such as name , owner , group or M@@ IM@@ E type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be lab@@ eled with the different features of the appropriate file or the folder . for each feature , you can specify if it is displayed at all , only if enough space to display is present or whether the area of sub@@ ordinate rect@@ angle occurs ) . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the lab@@ eling in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; with display algorithms for tre@@ em@@ aps , the general rule should be observed that the surface is propor@@ tionally to the size of the entry . in the Tre@@ ats in &amp; FS@@ View ; this aim is not always to be kept . note that less space is lost for the frame when the rect@@ angle is square . &quot;
&quot; how to split the area of an entry for the sub@@ ordinate entries , the implementation remains up to it . on this occasion , it is for the marking and to avoid space loss by means always advantageous to split the surfaces as possible . the best methods on this are rows , columns , or recur@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minimal set area for an entry regarding the menu entry view in area . instead , a smo@@ ker pattern is drawn into the area of the higher @-@ level application to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a sub@@ ordinate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ gets that was developed for the application K@@ C@@ ach@@ e@@ gr@@ ind . &quot;
the module picture gallery can be found in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; menu under ex@@ tras gallery ... or with C@@ tr@@ l ; I .

&quot; an easy to use camera guide will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; checking ; -@@ albums are supported by means of the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking ; together . &quot;
&quot; checking has come ; contains a quick picture editing with basic imaging tools . you can use these to review and correct your photos , review and correct . the editing abilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; checking came ; easy to use , it provides professional skills available . it works fully in the 16 @-@ bit color and all the available modules support the blank using li@@ bra@@ w , DN@@ G export and ICC control management . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more met@@ adata , such as &amp; eg . via the camera or the lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; checking ; an open source project . that means , it is dependent on the support of the end users . they should therefore report problems and improvement possibilities . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; attempts to report the milking of problems or improvement plans as easily as possible for them . wherever you are in the program , the Help menu provides an entry problem or wishes .... This opens your web browser a page in the error system . all required information is listed here . follow the instructions to send your report . &quot;
&quot; checking has come ; is a project that is supported by a community . that means that users and developers came to each other . if you have a regular user of &amp; checking ; however , we would like to answer questions of other users of &amp; checking ; however , in this mailing list , however , you should ask questions about other users of &amp; checking ; however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , however , you should be powerful this language so . &quot;
you can also visit the checking ; homepage to visit news about shared versions and other information about &amp; checking ; to experience .
&quot; the best start to get involved in &amp; checking , is the registration in the developers mailing list . guide to the report in the developers mailing list of &amp; checking came ; . &quot;
&quot; when you start &amp; checking ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to store your pictures and your database . simply enter a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the folder name or click the folder symbol to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data file is stored . this path remains the same for all the same sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you like . &amp; checking came ; will you additionally use as Al@@ ben@@ library . settings digi@@ ti@@ cal collections . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can indicate the top folder , the images contains , as the basic folder . &amp; publication came ; considers every sub@@ folder as an album . no picture is changed . while the su@@ cks of the folder you get a progress show like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; thir@@ sty the Bibli@@ othek@@ s@@ path in its full depth . you cannot submit any sub@@ folder , unless it list in pet@@ ri@@ fied folder . you can do this special folder , by placing a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as a base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ list will take no photos as symbols . you can change it by using any photo from the album and put it on the folder symbol . you will find more details on this in Section albums . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the basic folder , you can set up in &amp; checking ; your digital camera setup . after that , you should learn how to use my albums and my key@@ word to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , you may also handle it . the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out whether a special camera is supported , so you will find a list of supported devices in the menu Help Roh@@ kam@@ er@@ a@@ Support . &quot;
&quot; how to set up this and work with shell files , is described in the sections of Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ m and Ro@@ h work@@ flow . &quot;
&quot; an easy to use camera guide will be provided to you to connect with your digital camera , and you can download your photos directly in &amp; checking ; -@@ albums are supported by means of the library g@@ photo@@ 2 . of course , each medium and every card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; checking ; together . &quot;
&quot; modern digital cameras are registered with the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . for the actual transfer to the machine , the camera will then be realised as a USB socket ( P@@ TP ) and its derivatives . older cameras may also use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; uses the program g@@ Photo@@ 2 to communicate with digital camera . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is a free , additional software collection developed by over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 is also supporting the Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely spread protocol created by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transmission of images of digital cameras to machines and other peripher@@ als without the need of additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial interface for their communication with the machine . since photos in general are large files and transmis@@ sions about the serial port are slowly , this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; checking came ; supports these cameras and guides the transmission of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link . &quot;
li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 has to be created with li@@ bex@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails will be read by some li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 camera drivers . the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 . if the EX@@ IF support is not available in li@@ b@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might be stun@@ ned or the creation may be very slow . &quot;
&quot; one of the most beautiful things came to &amp; checking , is how simple its functionality can be expanded through modules : &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image Plugins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; publication ; , K@@ Photo@@ album , Sho@@ wi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view to develop . the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipulate pictures in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is considerably simpler , &amp; checking ; by writing a small module to supplement a function as the changes in &amp; checking came ; self perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either move the side with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or change in full screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ tr@@ l + F . &quot;
&quot; draw and drop it from pictures anywhere : you can disc@@ ard an image in another part of the tree , across the horizontal separ@@ ating line or into another application window . the only restriction is that an image cannot be stored in keywords , files list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file selection allows you to raise the most common : JP@@ EG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , TI@@ FF , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for fields that are currently displayed in the tool@@ bar . thus , filters on the fil@@ en@@ ame only when this ind can be displayed . what fields can be displayed can be set in the dialog box settings . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; displays an organized view on your phot@@ o- . all photos , written by &amp; checking ; these albums are saved according to the folder in which they were created on the hard disk , according to the name of their collection in the Al@@ ben@@ Properties or by the date when the album was created first , the date can be changed in the characteristics of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan images directly into an album . select &quot; &quot; Import &quot; &quot; images to scan images . you can also add a scre@@ enshot straight to an album . select &quot; Import &quot; scre@@ enshot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse on the target album and drop there . in the appearing menu you need to move the picture by moving or copy it . simply select all the photos and move it to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to give you information about this collection . to view the album properties , you must click on the album and select album properties menu . &quot;
&quot; Alb@@ um@@ - Kolle@@ ctions : are a method to mark your albums , so that you can choose to book your photos under a common name . if you want to add or delete albums by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the settings for collections . &quot;
&quot; the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used , when you sort your albums by date with view albums by date . &quot;
&quot; buttons El@@ t@@ ester , average , newest : this set the date on that of the oldest , the latest image or the average of the album . this will first try to calculate the average of images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first came up an album in &amp; checking , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ l@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; chosen . this is to help you remember the photos in the album . sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select a different photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button , and click on the context menu &amp; quot ; As a night@@ mar@@ ching show . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and the collections cannot be scr@@ apped .
&quot; checking came ; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the field of My sampling list at the left in the main window . album collections have another effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos . &quot;
&quot; the picture window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album are displayed in the picture window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this thumb@@ nail with the two lou@@ ps in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album the first time you need to wait briefly while the thumb@@ nails will be generated . you can avoid , in which you can create new thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; information on each image will be displayed below the preview display . which information is , you can edit over settings ; select here the albums page and adjust your preferences to your preferences . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails feature Hil@@ fe@@ eds , the f@@ ath@@ . if you can rest the mouse over one moment over a picture . the Help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the scre@@ enshot above in the section introduction to the main window shows such a help window . &quot;
photos are all that I came with &amp; checking ; goes . albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures as it suits you . you can reach all the features that are dealt with &amp; checking ; you can reach all the features that are connected with &amp; checking ; you can choose between the viewing menu or the menu image in the menu bar . you have the choice between the views of the images , a machine or the editing of pictures . &quot;
you can open the picture editing with a photo by using either F@@ 4 picture editing ... or selecting the context menu of the image with the right mouse button and Edit ... select in the section checking ; picture editing you can view your photos and change them .
&quot; it may occur that &amp; checking came ; the functionality you need not provide . you can open a photo in another program by using the context menu with the right mouse button , and how you can customize it to your needs if your program is not enumer@@ ated , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that using other image processing programs can come to problems with the met@@ adata in the image . some programs do not save this data from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aper@@ ture etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; displays two possibilities for rotation . the easiest way , it is to select the right mouse button on the preview and select a sequ@@ el . in the sub@@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , you can click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ aming from the context menu . please note that you can maintain the extension ( .@@ jpg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you got a photo of &amp; checking , it will be moved in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; moved . f@@ 8 image del@@ eting or reci@@ f Falls you prefer to really delete , you can use it by taking Shift . &quot;
&quot; the view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sl@@ is@@ te@@ quot ; organizes your photos from the data . &amp; checking came ; used for this either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of the last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; selecting a month from the list , all photos of this month are shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the file sheet below in the file view , so that you can only show the photos of the selected days . &quot;
&quot; photos with keywords provide a flexible and powerful way to organise and catalog . tags are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or all groups . once a key@@ word has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found through the selection of this key@@ word or search . &quot;
&quot; when a key@@ word is selected , all photos that have been marked with this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing so , you can also organize parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling , so you can find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and proven head@@ word in the IP@@ TC data fields of the picture , at least for JP@@ EG . so you can also use your tags in other programs . in addition , the tags in the loss of the database re @-@ imported , as soon as &amp; checking came ; the images may notice . &quot;
&quot; you can add new words by using the right mouse button either on &amp; quot ; My sampling , click on an existing key@@ word and then select new key@@ word . if you have a new key@@ word , after you have clicked on an existing key@@ word , this is the key@@ word this key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a key@@ word by clicking on the key@@ word with the right mouse button and delete . if you delete a key@@ word , the photo itself is not deleted . just the key@@ word is removed from this photo . &quot;
you can change the position of a key@@ word by moving it to the desired position in the tree and disc@@ ard there . then a menu that gives you the opportunity to move the key@@ word . a key@@ word can be at a time only once in the tree .
you can change the characteristics of a sample by clicking it with the right mouse button and select the key@@ word in the context menu . you can change the name of the sample and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling project .
&quot; to select another photo as an album icon , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select in the context menu as a night@@ club show . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to put it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to copy &amp; checking ; s functionality with keywords to deal with keywords , you must first select your photos with keywords ; My sampling record , you can click on the corresponding key@@ word on the tree &amp; quot ; My sampling record ; you can also click on the preview of the images and select from the context menu key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; you can specify a photo with any number of tags . the photo will be shown as soon as you choose one of the keywords to prove it to a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event in which it was made etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this is shown in the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a key@@ word in which you can click on the photo menu of the photo and select from the keywords menu , select only the keywords which have been assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time @-@ beam view displays a time @-@ dependent h@@ isto@@ gram of the number of images per time unit . a selection can select via this h@@ isto@@ gram . to select a time frame , you just need to click the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which indicates the time@@ frame . thus , all the images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the field below you can input a title and save your selection . it then appears in the list below .
&quot; cover all elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , collections , collections , files and in the future even more . &quot;
&quot; fog @-@ box is a small lamp is the green if the search takes results . if you click here the fil@@ let will be deleted and all images displayed again . if the search did nothing , then the lamp is red . &quot;
&quot; the advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side@@ bar with the tel@@ escope . if you open it , you can save this search here as a live search that has always been fil@@ tered what you entered as a search criterion . after you have been saved , t@@ d he filters in the list . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , push the head OK and the search is performed . the results will be displayed in the search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching my search list , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the view My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you search engine , the form to enter the search results again with the search details . in case you select an extended search , the dialog box appears for advanced search to search your previous search . here you will find more rules for finding your previous search . further information can be found in the section The tool for Exten@@ ded search . &quot;
&quot; if you want an existing search from the list , select in the context menu search . &quot;
&quot; the Exten@@ ded Search will provide you with a expan@@ sive search form with many search parameters , with which you can search in certain fields of &amp; checking ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of the search rules is used to reset the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ database . all rules are deleted , separated by oper@@ ators . each option can add to others about the logical operations all ... , A ... , Do not ... or At least ... connect . moreover , you can create Search for type &amp; quot ; AND NIC@@ HT@@ quot ; create . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair @-@ algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these sig@@ natures . the lower the difference between two images , the more they comply with it . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop each picture to find a similar way . by means of a Corpor@@ a , the results can be extended or down@@ sized . if you have a picture from anywhere on the icon of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open up and you can let it fall there . &quot;
sketch : free hand @-@ color sketch : draw a fast sketch and checking came ; find the matching photos . also here a pig @-@ value can be set .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive card@@ search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . you can press the mouse button in order to drop a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images of Ge@@ o data . &quot;
in the field below you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for a later use of the list below . he works like a live ge@@ o folder .
&quot; checking has come ; displays a light table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . he works with all supported image formats , also blan@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; select one or more pictures from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ tr@@ l ; L D@@ em light@@ table add from the context menu . the selection will be added to the light menu and open windows ; main window , you can open the lumin@@ osity quickly with L ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; from the preview of the window , you can compare the pictures that you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and disc@@ ard it . if you are preview of the tool@@ bar , select a zoo or contrac@@ eption on one of the pictures , then these can be compared to the other image . so you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is more suitable to select quickly from a picture series . if you use pa@@ ar@@ wise use of the tool@@ bar , then the two first pictures are automatically displayed in the areas of the diagram . use the left mouse button on the right @-@ hand side . this makes it easier to work through a series of similar pictures . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ ders work directly from the light , such as F@@ 4 file . ... &quot;
&quot; all image information from the right side@@ bar of the main window , are available for both thumb@@ nails in the light tic . this makes for example simply visual differences with exposure data . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of each zone you will find a built @-@ in pi@@ voting function , which you can see in the crossed arrows . to keep the visible area of the picture , you must adhere to it and drag the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressed in the mode both images will show the same image area . &quot;
the zo@@ oming works just like in other views . just use the zoom @-@ controller among the pictures or c@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel to zoom in the image and out to zo@@ oming . this happens in both pictures if you are in the mode Pre@@ view .
&quot; what is a digital stock - away from the fashion word ? digital stock management considers every part of the process follows after the image was taken to the final edition and the permanent storage . each of the photos takes , sc@@ anned or digital photos stores a form of digital stock management . but most of us do not make this in a systematic and efficient manner . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool to find a plan and practical tips on how to secure your pictures , protect , protect and use photos ; we consider the download , ren@@ ame , convert , evaluate , evaluate , optimize , optimize , waiting , wait and export of image files . &quot;
&quot; digital stock management takes on , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , warran@@ ted , secur@@ es , transformed , transformed and export content that is a mon@@ ial or cultural value . &quot;
met@@ adata is defined as data about data . met@@ adata is provided in accordance with your definition data that provide information about or a documentation of other data that can be managed by an application or environment .
&quot; I dare to claim if you find more than 1000 photos on your computer , then you will not even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then you don &apos;t even use fast searches and a secure archiving to you with other programs , platforms and formats free . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you maintain something in your system , the structure of information structure in contrast to data structure . you need to decide whether other users want to save it on a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc . please note that you will need to switch on a larger drive . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday images can quickly be found through your memory location , unless you were in one year several times the same place . if you make enough photos , then you will use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg . 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc ; use . export is a folder for images you can print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements like e.g. version of photos , archiving , work@@ flow , constant access of images on different topics and a large number of everything . within 10 years , 95 % archives and 5 % working files will have and you will then not want to organise your structure for this content . &quot;
which types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes st@@ acking easier . separate up new files from old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative image .
&quot; we also recommend the option met@@ adata in the settings of the met@@ adata in &amp; checking ; this ensures that ex@@ i@@ f@@ - and IP@@ TC data can be written into the file . if you forget this , then you can easily select the met@@ adata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item in the menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change what you want ? to do so , there &apos;s a met@@ adata editor for a number of selected attributes . of course these are the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now select every photo , keywords , and evaluation . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value then . you start best with the rating or ranking . this makes sense , as you can concentrate on the best photos with the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let us now let us know the keywords , keywords , as you may include other programs , or categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same cause . &quot;
&quot; when you import cat@@ alo@@ gical pictures from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; checking came ; automatically create the tree for you b@@ z@@ w the pictures to the right place . the changed keywords are done by &amp; checking ; updated during it the under@@ trees were per@@ secuted . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ adata : this is a very rough representation , since each block of met@@ adata is made up of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are qualities of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to label or comments , the third important tool to an@@ alogue your met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; do you want most anyone to see your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . they are sure to be interested in your photos . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then catch some details to see people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I say to you that is the Al@@ de@@ platz of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ maha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing is . wow ! you start to dream , associations , the historical time period is present again , you might even hear the silence . so , the cap@@ tion has changed your perception of this panor@@ amas . &quot;
&quot; for others who consider your photos , the title may sound more important than the picture itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to help the viewer to help you understand about the motif that she moved , has the understanding of what you understand . &quot;
&quot; it is fine when an image is not perfect , if it has the strength only to work with a label for itself alone . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; checking , you can save as much text , in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as compl@@ ain@@ ted . you can even export it to your wishes in the label and / or the title of Web @-@ Gal@@ eri@@ es@@ ystems . so you have to tell the story for the opening of no second time . &quot;
&quot; do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without the navigation system ? it &apos;s not a boring planet in front of Google Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already starts with light speed . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities provided by Ge@@ olo@@ k@@ alisation are already innumerable and will be in the future even deeper . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can continue to open your trips by means of images with geographical references . you can also export the photos on the reception center . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Flickr &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ y@@ left is a word game with copyright , and describes the practice to use copy@@ rights to restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms do also apply in all changed versions , so also for the work of others . &quot;
the following description tells you which information comes in the interior page of &amp; checking ; as information is stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for author and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person that has created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , for example , the name of a company or organization has been used , it should not be changed any more . this field does not support comp@@ mas or semi @-@ co@@ ons as separ@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for the author line ) : linked to the author . this field contains the work designation of the photographer . examples for this can be titles as : cler@@ k photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or Independent photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s author , it must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the entry field to identify who the photo offers . this does not necessarily have the author , then these organizations can be listed here . if the picture is a warehouse photo , then the group / agency is listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , although this does not provide protection against abuse . each of the slightly more than basic knowledge in working with computers can delete or change it . the solution to this problem are digital water@@ marks . for individuals , this protection is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals , this protection is very important to this . &quot;
&quot; the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; publication came , in the near future such a module for for@@ kli@@ fts are available . &quot;
&quot; issues : record defect , black@@ outs , EC@@ C , transmission error , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ aster , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we do not talk about CDs that can be lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are those that can also happen in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section we address problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll On@@ track , the largest data backup firm in the world , has some interesting statistics which has a loss of data . &quot;
&quot; to combat the problem with CDs / DVDs , this pru@@ dent need to be treated and you can no longer buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality . of course , you can also buy CDs and DVDs in Archi@@ v@@ quality . of course there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; Dollar ; 2 the piece that a lifetime of 100 years for itself claim . whether you believe it is in your surve@@ ying room . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can use this risk in which you use good dis@@ ks and good recording devices and they can store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot of reliable . it &apos;s all about choosing the right . &quot;
&quot; CDs and DVDs are very suscep@@ tible to errors , even if you just first written . about 75 % of the data are only effective data , the rest we needed for form@@ atting and control . despite this massive protection they are needed for form@@ atting , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for def@@ ective CDs and DVDs there is a favorable program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster the apparently miracle by CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is not available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications that damaged data from damaged dis@@ ks , hard disk , flas@@ h@@ media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; op@@ tic Media : Blu @-@ ray Dis@@ ks appear to capture the For@@ mats War against HD DVD . a dual layout , Blu @-@ ray disc can save 50 GB and therefore almost h@@ al the capacity of a dual Lay@@ er DVD with 8,@@ 5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course , also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disc . &quot;
&quot; if you want to check out the data again with a good reception of quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . likewise , you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author features and afterwards to a clean , dark dry and pre @-@ protected location . do not forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software . &quot;
&quot; Disk@@ 1 will retain your statistics for you . your manufacturer warranty comp@@ lies with a new disk , but not the data . Google will provide a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : dis@@ error messages &quot;
&quot; in short : dis@@ ks keep the longest when you are operated in the temperature range of 35 ° C up to 45 ° C . at lower temper@@ ament , SM@@ ART cannot notice these errors . some of SM@@ ART does not notice the immediate exp@@ ir@@ ation . these are particularly read@@ ef@@ eh@@ ler and publishing teeth . the expected living time is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; this is only a complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also have data loss due to an electric effect before you have secured the files , but these losses normally leave no major problems again . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices do not constitute a lot of power , it looks different in devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processors . these can cause severe damage . at your computer , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause damage , corrupted mother@@ boards and other defects . thus protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against gri@@ ps is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that a part of the energy heat absorbed and the rest is det . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in . however , remember that not every plug @-@ in also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , then you should be careful that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a specific minimum of protection . you should also take care that it protects against lightning bolt and thus protects the right connected devices . &quot;
&quot; since a over@@ voltage is using any cable to your computer , you should be careful that also all peripher@@ als are connected to your system . this also applies to telephone lines and cable mo@@ de@@ ms as well . some manufacturers place over @-@ voltage scor@@ er which also includes a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axi@@ al cable of the cable mo@@ de@@ ms and the television card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a notebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and are therefore very small and you also contain the protection for the modem . this makes you ideal for travel . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from smaller fluctu@@ ations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even an ou@@ ting of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in a fragile electricity supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the protection against over@@ tension , these devices can automatically supply cordless energy if a power black@@ out occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data while running the system . if you buy a US@@ V so you should be sure that they use the same quality requirements as an over@@ voltage protection . in addition , the life time of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; remember the potential risk , which your billing system is exposed and and compare its security in Strom@@ dysfunction with the costs to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is only a small price difference if you keep in mind how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all the cables before you go to holidays . &quot;
&quot; the Amazon Web Service contains S3 - Simple Storage Service - a simple memory service . with the right configuration you can include it as drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use this as a backup destination for your software . Google Shar@@ ed Storage is another popular offer with which you can store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; they are very expensive compared to the hard drives , but very expensive - 40 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; Dollar ; 500 . furthermore , you need to send the data via the compar@@ atively slow Internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable for a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . it is too slow . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Flickr ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is not available in full resolution online . the professional variant will not be available to you in full resolution online . for 25 $ per year you get unlimited memory , which should be checked in reality . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the Web solutions are very safe . transmission errors are automatically processed thanks to the TCP protocol and in the large companies is included in the offer a backup and a shared memory . thus , they are des@@ ast@@ er@@ sure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the machine . all transfers are suscep@@ tible to transmission error . the file system @-@ fs and b@@ tr@@ fs make at least the data integrity between operating system and hard disk .
&quot; the worst thing is that you said , if a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . all these disorders remain un@@ discovered until you have no protection to it . no one seems to have thought of it in your computer . no one seems to have thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable network parts are another source of transmission loss , since they generate interference within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are currently not affected particularly by transfer problems , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes per year . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ FS of Sun Micro@@ systems seems to be one of two candidates , which can be circum@@ navig@@ ated to lower level , and can be highly scalable . it &apos;s open source , with many patents and is available under one to the GPL in@@ compatible license for Solaris and Leopard . we can only hope that there is soon also available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows available . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ ine file system . this is still in the Alpha status . it uses the same protective mechanisms used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss when Not@@ ebook and 46 % are responsible for working systems . not@@ ebooks are already the proportion of theft .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a less damage , such as theft or re @-@ install@@ ments . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under Linux ; for a long time no longer has been sighted . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss as proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , It@@ Fs , J@@ FS and X@@ FS , to call the common file systems . a very good English article can be found here . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investig@@ ating process at a sudden interruption while surgery is higher and an un@@ defined status will be avoided . if a file has not been stored completely before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human mistake are the main causes for data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aper@@ tures of fundamental physical boundaries . it is meant that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and smoking characteristics are not far away from this limit .
today cameras go towards the 10 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result is rather worse for compact cameras . even DS@@ LR cameras have your border with 10 @-@ 12 Meg@@ ap@@ i@@ xel . for higher resolution you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive you get today for 100 &amp; euro ; so do not make anyone else responsible for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are often affected by a plan and test this backup before you can do anything more dangerous as the re@@ installation of your operating system to make the exchange of plates or the res@@ id change of hard drives .
&quot; suppose you make your backup daily on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a lightning strikes , you will be lucky if the drive was not connected in the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster suggests locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget airplane @-@ happy : fire , water , electricity , children and theft are dangerous enough for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Des@@ ast@@ er@@ vor@@ es always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of the physical separation : as above , a more common reason for a loss of data despite securing the panic . if you have a backup which is not available immediately , then you can save one day . &quot;
&quot; complete backup : a complete backup of all files that are safegu@@ ar@@ ded . it is a snapshot without history , and represents a complete copy at a time . &quot;
differential : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete backup and the last difference .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup has been changed . it creates the original status at any time when such backup was made . this backup comes the next with the exception that it is only delayed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machine . in contrast to script controlled FTP sessions or other types of file trans@@ cription copied r@@ sync only the difference of files that were really changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh
secure important images directly after you have stored on your computer to a DVD or another optional medium .
&quot; this approach will allow you enough time to discover and restore losses . at the same time , you come for backup but with &amp; lt ; 130 % of the size of work files . in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly moment for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . each additional di@@ lution should be done manually after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; topics : met@@ adata , stored in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original , storage , scal@@ ability , media , re@@ ali@@ enable pictures and met@@ adata , copy the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtu@@ alization , ... &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 year , that &apos;s about the time period in which you really are interested in your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable because of your nature , you need to look at everything today with caution and re@@ evaluate the time . unfortunately , there is no other possibility as a certain vig@@ il@@ ance . every 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is back@@ wards compatible . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the issues of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by the explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtu@@ alization is nowadays available for everyone . so if you have an old system that is important for reading your pictures , then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your machine architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary to convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the expression of the possibility to change a system in its size . it actually means growing .
let &apos;s assume that you have been planning the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated plate or partition . with * nix systems such as &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and shift it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ razor if your new record was detected by the system , but do not hang them . &quot;
&amp; dollar ; DD if = / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; par@@ ted res@@ ize / dev / s@@ d@@ c # Source ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / sad@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of reis@@ er@@ fs if necessary
open source standards have the big advantage of an open specification . even if one day no software there is more to read it then you can create them yourself . this task will be easier from year to year .
gi@@ f is a proprietary format that disappears slowly from the market . you should therefore no longer use it .
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard designed by G@@ IF , but it can store much more . it is los@@ s@@ free , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC met@@ adata , 16 @-@ bit per colour channel and full transparency . &quot;
&quot; TI@@ FF was widely distributed as picture format . it manages images in high quality , but requires very large files . with some cameras you can save your pictures in this format . there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types . &quot;
DN@@ G The Digital Neg@@ ative file format is a licence @-@ free and open raw material that has been developed by Adobe Systems . DN@@ G was developed based on TI@@ FF / EP format and committed to the use of met@@ adata . it is now based on TI@@ FF / EP format and we hope to use the competitors Canon and Nikon at some time .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , in 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML based X@@ MP technology , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . this file is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers attract it before an original of your recording , mostly in the rough format . X@@ MP adap@@ ts as it stores the met@@ adata separately from the image file . however , you may think about whether you use DN@@ G as a container and put it all together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online met@@ adata and business models , including the work of D@@ C@@ MI and the D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and enligh@@ tened efforts to achieve a far @-@ reaching acceptance of met@@ adata and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reading or the scanner . as long as the pictures on the camera edi@@ um are , you can use it as temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to DN@@ G and save it in your raw archive . this function is not yet implemented .
&quot; for a fine editing process you can use external programs . if you entered the pictures again with &amp; checking , then you should add the met@@ adata again . these were cut from the other programs under circumstances . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for the copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them only in Web@@ galleries , enco@@ ding in MPEG , use in contact boxes , print and etc . &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; checking ; in the section adding a photo to an album , you will have a description of how you can add pictures that you already have on your hard drive , but the camera interface provides you with many advanced settings for import of images to your Al@@ ben@@ database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking , connect them with the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it off . a further description can be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect with your camera . for some cameras it may take a while . some cameras do not appear thumb@@ nails . if this is the case , the fil@@ en@@ ames and a symbol of the file format for each file , photos , movies , music etc. on the camera will appear . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information about each entry . with the page features and met@@ adata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; this dialog shows file properties and the photo information , which is internally saved by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . please note that with some digital cameras , all information is available . &quot;
&quot; the met@@ adata met@@ adata shows the internal met@@ adata , such as EX@@ IF , manufacturer notice , GPS etc . this information is the same as in the met@@ adata page on the main window of &amp; checking ; or the picture editing . please note that these met@@ adata cannot be available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the button download and then download the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; checking ; . download the photos are not deleted and we recommend you to check if the pictures have been downloaded in an album before removing the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all photos , you can only select the desired output methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you selected the photos , use the button to download and then download the selected photos . the button is selected as long as you selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option is available new . these pictures were not downloaded from &amp; publication ; in this case , the new pictures are marked with a star in advance window . if you choose this option , of course , only the new pictures are downloaded . &quot;
&quot; when you use the buttons all download or download the selected game , a dialog with which you can select the target album , displayed in the photos . the list of the existing albums is displayed like normal folder . select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; checking came ; loads the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all deleted at once , by selecting the button Dele@@ te All for you to select it first and then delete the delete selected . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to recover from the camera . so the photos will not be deleted in the du@@ st@@ bin of &amp; k@@ de ; so you should carefully checked the photos to delete it from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so much quicker . &quot;
cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos often not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames normally will resume after the photos downloaded from the camera . this can be useful to integrate the date and time when the image was made to integrate into the fil@@ en@@ ame .
&quot; in the next section you will find options for rotating and mir@@ rors of the image and for dat@@ at@@ basi@@ lar under@@ pin . if you use this option , automatically a folder will be created each day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transmission opens three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the plate . the first two relate to the author in the section Standard Aut@@ ori@@ denti@@ ty . if you select this , the corresponding entries are copied from the EX@@ IF information in the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; if you wish a different file format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix photo - % Y@@ - % Y@@ - % H : % M : % S . for further adap@@ tations , you should read the help of the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you will be able to change the file names in lo@@ wer@@ case letters . or in case letters , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the &amp; checking came ; for a photo , is shown below the name that displays the camera in the preview . your settings for ren@@ ame are saved and used automatically when you open the next time the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; may use all the information about the orientation of the camera to start recording , for automatic rotation during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section side@@ bar met@@ adata you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic turn is normally switched on , and if your camera fails to supply this information , the photo is complete . if you want to switch off the automatic turn , use the button Exten@@ ded and choose the Autom@@ atic Rot@@ ation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera will provide information about the date when the photo was made , the picture can be made available , this instruction can be automatically downloaded in the target album . all pictures with the same date will be loaded into the same sub@@ album . not all images are available in the same sub@@ album . not all images provide you with the same item . in Section side@@ bar Met@@ a @-@ data you can read , which information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally switched off , and in this case records &amp; checking came ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change it , use this option manually and choose the dat@@ at@@ opo@@ lies at the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is der@@ button Download . then select high @-@ load . the file op@@ tionally &amp; k@@ de ; appears in which you can select the files , which are to be up@@ loaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods . &quot;
&quot; after the selection process is done , asks &amp; checking , wherever the images are to be loaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the desired folder and press OK to start the upload . the images are not deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this makes a position indicated in long@@ itu@@ dinal and latitude , which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European Galileo or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographical location . not everyone uses an airplane to make an area by automatic recording of GPS data to carto@@ graphic . environmental plann@@ er , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you later forgot what the photo was taken , you can access a browser which shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; publication ; users want to send a postcard to another , or just want to document this aspect , it &apos;s good to get the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data in the image ? first you should know that ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and maps are actually supported . there are at least three ways to reach this . directly with the correct hardware , via a post @-@ processing of GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module to the geographic assignment ( manual ) and last to the manual input of known places . &quot;
&quot; so far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few that collabor@@ ates with GPS recei@@ vers . either as a module , or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ asset Eye IPF A@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from a device can be done with g@@ p@@ sman or g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in the g@@ p@@ x format , since this is the only format which is supported by the module to geographic assignment . &quot;
there are various programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page you can get the same under &amp; Linux ; g@@ p@@ s@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ p@@ s@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and latitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the pre @-@ colored coordinates , which are created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ google@@ .com does not show European road cards . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; checking came , try to give you so much control over his work@@ flow as possible . there are many settings that the behavior of &amp; checking came ; change upon these settings , you need to change in the menu settings . you can switch between these settings by clicking on the symbols of the left . &quot;
action can select on embedded preview or picture editing . you put the default behavior of &amp; checking ; fast when you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardization activity and the copyright data . these data are automatically written to the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields , if the option is selected automatically in the appropriate IP@@ TC data fields . also in a database synchron@@ ization , these data are written into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; author is a syn@@ onym for the editor &apos;s line : this field should be the professional drawing of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as a cler@@ k photographer , freel@@ ance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a detailed description of the author , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for suppliers : use this field to indicate the photo you offer . this does not need to be the author , as this is listed here for a message agency such as Re@@ uters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations should be registered here , then the group or agency should be included in the picture here . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC actions save the data in the appropriate IP@@ TC fields . this ensures that met@@ adata is permanently stored in the picture , and not only in the database of &amp; checking ; . these met@@ adata are also available to other programs and can be imported in &amp; checking ; imports will be lost without having lost . &quot;
pictures saved as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ F@@ IF ) in JP@@ EG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments that you add to your photos with the images embedded in the pictures . caution : in pictures that already occurred in pictures are extracted and over@@ written by the images .
&quot; the settings contains all the options for the information that appear when the mouse @-@ cursor in the main window above a file rests . depending on the option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; publication ; supports a number of different image formats , and some video and audio formats . to determine which file types &amp; publication came ; indicate , you can add the file expan@@ sions of this list and remove it . any file in a &amp; publication came ; Alb@@ um@@ folder that has no such extensions , of &amp; checking came ; ignored . &quot;
default settings can be reset again by pressing the button button to the right of each category .
&quot; the settings of the lumin@@ ance of &amp; checking , can be placed on this side to the default values . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . the option &amp; quot ; In the whole picture @-@ size lad@@ en@@ quot ; if you have one , then you can only get better results results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image processing uses a black background behind the shown photos . if you prefer another color , you can select it here . you can switch off the tool@@ bar once you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark@@ er or bri@@ ghter color in the picture . these colors will be defined here . in picture editing , this picture mode can be entered with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling is meant that the images are co@@ ded in a higher resolution of lumin@@ osity than in color formations . please read this article in Wikipedia for the closer explanation .
&quot; using the setting of P@@ NG compression , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss of loss . if you have a quick calcul@@ ator , you can count this value to a high compression . thereby , 1 : a low and 9 a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF files , you can switch to the de@@ fl@@ ate compres@@ sor for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect the image quality as the de@@ fl@@ ate algorithm . &quot;
&quot; with the attitude loss of JP@@ EG @-@ 2000 files you can save loss of loss . even if you select the loss of loss , the ratio between quality loss and file size is far better than with the normal JP@@ EG . when this paragraph was written , Met@@ adata was not yet supported , but was found in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in the previous versions of &amp; checking , image processing was just a picture @-@ looking for photos . currently , it is rapidly developing a tool to manipulation your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image processing . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are equal . if the sli@@ pped green pixel of the C@@ CD sensor in delicate light react as the pixel in odd lines , this difference creates a little soft , eliminated but the 2x@@ 2 G@@ itter@@ patterns with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or the A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; when this option is set , the white @-@ off of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic colour balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is used only when the white @-@ off is not set . standard , it is a fixed colour balance , which was photographed on a white map which was photographed in the sunlight . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super C@@ CD SL@@ R cameras . the use of the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps have more details in the sh@@ re@@ tention . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the standard is it the sh@@ re@@ ter , so the parts of your images are burned down , due to the in@@ ability of your camera shows the sh@@ red@@ ded results , as it shows the sh@@ re@@ ter in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the sh@@ re@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels in general are not as fast s@@ late as green and red . &amp; checking , and d@@ cra@@ w therefore attempt to re@@ construct the missing green and red shares from the yet saturated blue pixel . of course , this is a question , how much color or wh@@ ites you want . &quot;
&quot; when you select the option re@@ construct , you get the option to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be adapted for each image individually . &quot;
&quot; set the le@@ aking value according to your taste . you probably have to put it a bit higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the image options of the &amp; checking ; -@@ picture editing . to keep the time for the dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing value , you should be conservative . &quot;
&quot; a dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the sub @-@ fil@@ ter@@ data , which have many cameras and which a matrix is known as CF@@ A @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation or colour construction . &quot;
&amp; checking came ; and D@@ cra@@ b put you three alternatives available : Bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . according to some tests it was created . as if A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for adap@@ tive homo@@ gene@@ ity Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm required by D@@ cra@@ b . Bil@@ ine@@ ar is interesting if you are looking for a fast solution with an acceptable result . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color @-@ sof@@ tening of your l@@ enti@@ ls you can get the red and blue @-@ proo@@ fre@@ aders here . this is certainly the best method for a color correction , as you are converted during the gro@@ wer . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color formations and gives instructions how to be given again . there are also L@@ CMS and &amp; checking ; information such as color formations are translated from a color level in the others so that the colors are as accurately as possible .
behavior questions if a picture is opened in image processing / color management module with rough files .
&quot; color Profile Section Set@@ ting here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / user / .@@ color / ICC , in which you save all your profiles . &amp; checking came ; examine this folder in then during startup . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ad ; for your profiles to be deposited . everything can be changed while opening the blank file .
&quot; the colour management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your pictures are color@@ fully manages not the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; input profiles should be used to the cam@@ aher@@ ero and model that you use . not all profiles are prepared in the same way . there are some , such as Canon , which do not have colour ton@@ aries or gam@@ ma@@ ids . currently , no cra@@ w Gamma does not need for con@@ versions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the colour ton@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft Pro@@ of profile , which you can em@@ ulate how your image can be given by a device . this is very useful before you can print a smaller color area as your camera and some colors therefore very satisfied . this could be manually correct , rather than to rely on the flas@@ hing algorithm of your printer . &quot;
for most cameras it is quite obvious that colour profile among them is intended for . unfortunately not with the models of Canon . therefore this answer is of course in@@ officially :
&quot; the Canon profile extension makes the style recognize for the goal : F for accurate style , L for landscapes , N for Neutr@@ al , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; image plugin Interface . it is an interface that can be supported by a series of &amp; wedge ; images , images and images ; many modules support that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the file you want to use , and these will then be downloaded from &amp; checking ; loaded . these modules appear as new entries in the main window of the main window and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ command for tasks carried out by modules , can be set in the menu under settings short@@ cut . &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plug@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals for the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slides should be easy to understand . the top regul@@ ator j@@ us@@ its the time between the images , normally 4 @-@ 5 seconds good . the other h@@ ubs turn off the met@@ adata and the met@@ adata on the lower end of the images are displayed . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left a list of all cameras supported on the left . on the right side there is a button Autom@@ atic detection , the camera tries to connect to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure that the camera is connected correctly , and in picture @-@ line mode is attached . currently , you are here &apos;s serial , US@@ B@@ - and USB / Fire@@ Wire mass storage . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) to mass storage cameras . you need to specify the path , / m@@ oths / camera or / m@@ nt / spending , specify on which you attach your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; checking ; to use , you need to connect the camera with your computer , and turn it into the display mode . &quot;
&quot; try out whether &amp; checking came ; the camera automatically re@@ alizes . if not , you can set camera od@@ ell and Port manual . after you have set your camera , your camera appears in the menu camera . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert them all here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confir@@ ming dialog for reloc@@ ating &gt; images in the tr@@ ash@@ can display , you can set the talk of &amp; checking ; when you delete a photo in an album . in the del@@ eting of a picture and delete a record you will find further details . &quot;
editorial changes through the right side@@ bar can be tac@@ itly used by &amp; checking ; if you use the option changes in the right side@@ bar without any queries . otherwise you will need to apply the changes with the button changes .
&quot; you can also take the indication of the welcome image of &amp; checking ; when starting to tie , this acceler@@ ates the process of checking and checking . &quot;
&quot; the setting to search for new photos is forcing &amp; checking ; the basic folder to search for new or deleted albums / photos . this prolon@@ gs the start @-@ time of &amp; checking ; if something out of the base folder was deleted , asks &amp; checking , whether it is supposed to delete it from the base folder . &quot;
different shades can be used in &amp; checking ; used to customize the main window to suit your taste . these settings allow you to select under settings design out of the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is enumer@@ ated below :
&quot; these designs are defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; checking , you will find more information on this tutorial . &quot;
&quot; checking has come ; contains quick picture editing with some basic tools . you can use these to view your photos and for correction and improvement . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of the preview / Edit menu . &quot;
the image processing contains a number of tools to enhance your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; checking ; so they may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules you can set up in section picture editing .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the fil@@ en@@ ame , current date number , enlar@@ ging factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar on the top of the top and including the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently needed functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image processing change your photos . however , none of the features will change the original photo before you Save the original photo before you Save File Save and Start button saving from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer recover the original photo as soon as you have saved the image . &quot;
so you should make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with file saving .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the menu File re @-@ manufacture or the button The button restore restore to tool@@ bar . you then lose any change that you have done at the photo since the last store . &quot;
virtually any action of image processing can be revers@@ ed or recovered . the last action you can und@@ o by selecting editing back@@ end or re@@ restored by selecting the Edit restore from the menu .
&quot; when you use this frequently , you should turn the short@@ cut code , C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Z to the back@@ end and watch C@@ tr@@ l ; -@@ Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB in the tool@@ bar for a moment longer , you get a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions are also revers@@ ed or recovered . &quot;
&quot; once you have started the image processing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same key@@ word by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image high , picture down or the entries in the menu file , you are asked if you want to save it . &quot;
&quot; you can get in the photo and out zo@@ oming in which you can use C@@ tr@@ l ; mouse wheel , or symbols in the tool@@ bar or using the entries in the An@@ si@@ eve menu . &quot;
&quot; to adjust a picture to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : view factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view screen@@ screen mode shows the photo in full screen mode . they come into the normal view , where you can use the Es@@ cape key . usually , you can call this in the setup dialog by &amp; checking ; change this you can call from the &amp; checking ; main window . see the section for setting up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; when you want to print the current picture , you can select the image in the menu and get the standard tab ; print dialog . you can adjust the settings here before you print your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or full sentences . all pictures pages can be printed out of your selection . you just need to select the pictures with the standard methods and select from the menu item Ex@@ erc@@ ing printing . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the viewing came ; the main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is available without the navigation panel , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five rider is clicked on : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same rider lets the side@@ bar appear and disappear again in the edge .
&quot; in the descri@@ b@@ tion you can type or insert cap@@ tions with unlimited size . please note the note below . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 . this means that all special characters are permitted . the characters are copied into the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields , so that you can use other programs . &quot;
&quot; the IP@@ TC data only support AS@@ C@@ II characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are converted to 2000 characters and special characters are converted . if you want to use the IP@@ TC application field in other applications , you should observe these restrictions . &quot;
&quot; after which you have commented on it , use either the button or simply change to the next image , the characters will be saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the application button there is a button More . with this , you can read further met@@ adata from the selected file or the database . however , it is always done if you chose a met@@ adata setting that is always written in the pictures . &quot;
the section rating shows a rating scheme from 0 to 5 stars and can be applied in search and sor@@ ting . it can be applied either with a single mou@@ sec@@ lick on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut . to evaluate multiple images at the same time . to select multiple images at the same time . select it and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the enco@@ ding follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the sampling view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the sampling tree and a selection box with the previously used in this &amp; checking , -@@ session . &quot;
the sampling is dynam@@ ically adapted to the key@@ word . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a key@@ word . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the lower end is another relief when entering head@@ lines at a picture series . if you entered various keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by mark@@ ers of the corresponding mach@@ inations in the tree . all tags of an image are stored in the IP@@ TC field key@@ word .
&quot; when multiple images are selected at the main view and select a key@@ word in the keywords , this only indicates the highlighted picture and not the entire selection , if you want to choose a selection with a key@@ word , please read the key@@ word filter . &quot;
&quot; the side@@ bar sampling is used to change the selection of images displayed in the main window . normally , the left side@@ bar is used with their album , file , keywords , and view@@ points , only the pattern of these two are displayed . all keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and disc@@ ard it . suppose you have selected multiple images in the main view . if the key@@ word already exists , you can easily drag it from the right side@@ bar and click on the selection . ther@@ eu@@ pon , a dialog that you ask if you want to put the key@@ word . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the pictures on a calendar tag . the sampling filter does not refer to No keywords , which has been selected the amount to three images . they were drawn with Str@@ g + a , and then there was a key@@ word from the right key@@ word on the selection and asked there . a dialogue asks whether this key@@ word is set to be set . &quot;
&quot; this search for changes will take place at every start of the program , and you can also be switched between settings different . &quot;
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and discover that it should be one or its needs , you can easily change it with a double @-@ click on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; 1 ) : the entry that is sought in the database . this can be an album , name , key@@ word , image , keywords , etc . &quot;
&quot; 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string that is already set in the database . &quot;
you can e.g. specify a Exten@@ ded search through all elements of the database with the following options :
&quot; if you want to group options , just need the tick @-@ box at the end of the rule and then use the button group . the options then look as follows : &quot;

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I mainly came to &amp; checking ; s concrete implementation adapted .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed work@@ flow is that the colours that have photographed and sc@@ anned colors are obtained from the fact photographed or sc@@ anned colors . with a color @-@ managed work@@ flow you can reach that the colors on your monitor comply with the camera or scanner that you print from your camera or scanner or publish the colors that you print from your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; if the issue comes to color management , then everyone wants to know which buttons it must push for the results that he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you informed information about color management at any point of image processing . additionally , links with deeper information enable you to make your own informed decisions to make you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image work@@ flow meets all the criteria listed below , then you don &apos;t have to worry about color management . &quot;
you are working on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the S@@ GB @-@ color bul@@ b . ( further information can be found below )
&quot; your only other images are per e @-@ mail or the Web , where S@@ GB of de @-@ facto standard is . &quot;
&quot; so if R@@ GB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color and thus have to worry about color management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the Lim@@ itation of S@@ GB in comparison to the colors we really can see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colours that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ hoe region , and the colors in the s@@ R@@ GB of color , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional re@@ posit@@ ories of s@@ R@@ GB with some larger bul@@ ls , so visit Bruce Lin@@ d@@ blo@@ oms excell@@ ente page and click on Info and then on information About R@@ GB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
must I escal@@ ate my monitor if I decided to work for only in S@@ GB Far@@ ru@@ m ?
&quot; yes ! whether you work in S@@ GB @-@ Far@@ ming or not , you need to build your monitor cal@@ li@@ bri@@ ms , since s@@ R@@ GB works that your ; on@@ itor is calculated on S@@ GB of s@@ R@@ GB , then you need to either use your monitor on the S@@ GB standard , an appropriate monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions available , which can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , before you try any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize the identical , automatic fe@@ ather and contrast illumin@@ ating from the menu subsequent automation correction are automatically trying out of your colors to make the best . you will have to experiment with these effects , to see which best suits your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method will scale the leu@@ st@@ ere level over the entire picture , so the dark@@ est point black and the bri@@ gh@@ test point is as bright as possible without its shade . this function is often a magical correction for pictures that are dark or washed . &quot;
&quot; same : this method j@@ us@@ its the illumin@@ ant factor of the colors of the selected image , so that the h@@ isto@@ gram of the intention is as flat as possible . thereby , the absorption is very good results in improving the contrast of a picture , sometimes it also produces just rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation which causes either miracle in an image or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic filing : this method maxim@@ izes the colour area in the red , green and blue channel . it determines the dark and bright fron@@ ts and j@@ us@@ its the red , green and blue channels to the complete h@@ isto@@ grams . &quot;
contrast reaction : this method improves the contrast and the lumin@@ osity of the R@@ GB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values in the widest area and a new ji@@ usti@@ fication of all values in between . this is only visible in wi@@ ped images and can be a good correction for bad photos .
the white @-@ off of &amp; checking came ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white @-@ off of a photo .
&quot; the whit@@ e@@ equal correction is somewhat limited since over a color @-@ bit with 8 @-@ bit per colour . in case you can perform too far from the original image , areas with over@@ exposure . if you work the white off in the raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , so your possibilities for correction are better . &quot;
this tool is based on a whi@@ ch@@ equ@@ als of copyright protected by Pa@@ wel T. Jo@@ ch@@ ym . you start it via the menu @-@ application colors white off the image processing .
&quot; the window display can be adjusted in size . on the left hand , both the original image and the preview of the tool image are adapted . if you want to see the original white picture automatically , then it is enough to click the window . &quot;
the preview of the Target has a red mark@@ er . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixels under this mark@@ er is shown as a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram .
&quot; on the right above , a h@@ isto@@ gram appears that dynam@@ ically is changed once you change a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful as well as you have a parameter . this h@@ isto@@ gram is very helpful in fact whether one of the three colours or your sum is displayed . the sum is called L@@ umin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your outcome depends on the shade , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow ins@@ cription lets you improve the shadow details of your photos or also download . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the controls mentioned above , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the picture show around the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the whit@@ e@@ tion . in this way , the temperature and Green values are automatically set . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white off with the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indi@@ gn@@ ator increases the colors when more than a color canal of the pix@@ els over@@ exposed .. you will see the combined result in the whit@@ eboard . this is displayed in the Pre@@ view as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and store are exactly this . each setting of the whit@@ e@@ ther@@ ness you have set , you can save it in a text file and re @-@ load later . &quot;
&quot; the button @-@ settings again sets all the filter values back to its standard values and to the neutral whi@@ tish of the whit@@ e@@ tion . please note that neutral settings will change another photo as your original . if you save it , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can set the code of code for high @-@ quality pictures here . 8 @-@ bit co@@ ding is the widespread JP@@ EG format , 16 @-@ bit co@@ ding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . this enco@@ ding requires even more disk space , calcul@@ ating time and is available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and DN@@ G . &quot;
&quot; this tool opens the same dialog as the handling of raw images . it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles . colour ton@@ ate can be performed by the sub@@ window for the use of color profiles . a detailed guide for the use of color profiles , you can drag the chapter Color Management to Rate . &quot;
another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correction . this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels at the same time . this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake . this is why you can always find the same correction . in the manual for key correction you will find more information .
a very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; &amp; checking came ; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a c@@ ant filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing was solar , even Sab@@ ati@@ ans , an effect that was created when you put an partially developed pressure of a short flash . this had the effect that the ligh@@ tening areas dark@@ er and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second lighting . this tool was a part negative of the picture . this tool permits you to j@@ us@@ hed this interesting effect . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the solar @-@ level . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further increase ultimately generates a neg@@ ativity that does not produce a phot@@ op@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) , and this is adapted ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % . &quot;
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it is different from a satur@@ ation that makes him stronger and gl@@ at@@ ant . try it easy , he em@@ bell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
&quot; Vel@@ via is the brand name for a natural light @-@ optimized color movie made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure . Vel@@ vi@@ as strongly saturated color are also some photographs , especially of which the little landscapes are shown too much . &quot;
the ne@@ on@@ filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on@@ light on the contrasts . the parameter level controls the strength of the outcome and the sli@@ der re@@ ps the strength of the ne@@ on@@ light . in large images the filter can be the entire CPU for one moment .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contra@@ sting and the lumin@@ osity of your photos . you can download the different color pe@@ ers of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . once you are satisfied with the result use the button lab@@ k and you are applied .
if you make a photo with bad weather conditions you can get the reverse issue : a great choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of raising them . all changes you can perform in the preview . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex tool gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ osity / contrast / Gamma is the tool key effect for improving exposure . even if the dialog on this tool acts very complicated , you need for the use in this tool only the area of shooting . concrete the three sliding beneath the h@@ isto@@ grams . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of the inten@@ tional values , a h@@ isto@@ gram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph@@ ene are three sliding into the in@@ doors and that can be moved to change the intensi@@ fication of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the regul@@ ator and keep track of how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and the preview of the picture can be viewed . the preview is dynamic , using the settings of the image , updated . on the left , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box can be adjusted if the h@@ isto@@ gram is represented using a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for pictures of a digital camera is often the linear H@@ isto@@ gram dominated by a single column . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic disposition is useful .
&quot; three regul@@ ator : the top one for the dark notes , the middle for the bright sounds and the lowest for the middle tones , often called gam@@ ma@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the three colour @-@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically j@@ us@@ hed the shade of the shadow , middle and bright sounds automatically . in addition , there is one button for fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
ga@@ des : the E@@ ditions allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to evaluate the ga@@ unt@@ te . for example , the compression of the exclusion can be used for example to create a hidden image as background while something else is in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intention of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , the displayed values can be stored in the fil@@ esystem and later re@@ charged . this will use Gimp levels format . &quot;
&quot; when you use this mode and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input matches will be re @-@ evaluated for all shadows , means and sun @-@ scene . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click the preview of the original image for red , green , blue and lum@@ ber channels . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ gn@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you can only see the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the adju@@ sting of the inputs applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and Alpha channel , as well as the ex@@ ga@@ ards are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left side , half of the original and the target image is displayed . the preview is dynam@@ ically updated depending on your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modifications channel : this selection box allows the channel to enter the channel changes from the module :
&quot; beside this box , two symbols are placed to switch between a linear view and a log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images using a digital camera , linear mode is created in the linear mode of linear colour . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic mode will help . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a cran@@ ky way to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright sounds are corresponding with dark@@ er ex@@ ga@@ des and that the associated image pixel are dark@@ er . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the original photos is a red mark@@ er . if you want to change this mark@@ er on the area you want to change , a suitable line on the curve is displayed , which represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it up and down , until the value is j@@ us@@ hed out to your taste . &quot;
&quot; save as and loading : with these buttons , you can do exactly this . each curve that you can have created it can be saved in the fil@@ esystem and later be loaded . the file format is the Gimp cam format . &quot;
&quot; when you create this method and the three colour pi@@ pet@@ tes buttons , automatically create the control points of the curve for all channels of the shadow , middle and solar scene . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette that you want to use and click on the original image to put the control points for the red , green , blue and lum@@ ber curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ gn@@ ator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels , you get the combin@@ ated result . here is an indicator , i.e. you can see the effect only in the preview and it is not an effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ white picture which was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance canal . shadow and sunny scene was applied with the colour pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original image is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel mix@@ er of the &amp; checking comes ; image processing is a tool to improve color channels or change the color gra@@ dations of the photos .
the channel mix@@ er is another highly developed tool to mix the shades of images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel mix@@ er of image processing .
with the se@@ wer box you can select the color for the H@@ isto@@ gram : this gives you a first reference as you can correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and rash . the left area of the window will show you a preview . the original can be viewed compared to your own rider .
the preview of the target image has a red mark@@ er . if you position this in the picture a vertical line in the h@@ isto@@ gram will show you the appropriate color value .
&quot; the controls for the module are right below : regul@@ ator for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you can also activate the appropriate color components , as the channel mix@@ er then retain the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical if you also use the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical if you also use the appropriate color components . this is particularly practical , if you also use the appropriate color components , as the channel mix@@ er then reduce the boot channel for the generation of magnificent black @-@ white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix Mon@@ och@@ re , the reduction of color leads to a visible noise , which does not appear in the same place in the colour canal and whose noise patterns occur in each channel differently . if that is the case , you can reduce your mon@@ och@@ re conversion thus in which you can reduce the color . &quot;
saving as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any mix@@ er setting can save you for later and then load . used file format is the Gimp @-@ channel Mix@@ er format .
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indi@@ gn@@ ator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and display the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , that means you can only see the effect in the preview and it &apos;s no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel is newly j@@ us@@ hed . the original image is activated ( 1 ) and the original image is under ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography was always intrigu@@ ing because of your abstract skills . with the development of digital photography . with the development of digital photography , black / White is a working step , since color images can easily be converted to the computer . also with a set of film @-@ roll@@ ment profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford H@@ P@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P@@ 2 Super
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green ruler filter . this looks good , with all the scenery pictures and fits especially well to portraits against the sky . thus similar to the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
orange fil@@ tered : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a che@@ eks lime filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and air pictures . thus similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) orange fil@@ tered . &quot;
red filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red liner filter . this creates a dramatic ascension effect and can simul@@ ate mo@@ on@@ light into the day @-@ time . thus similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) Rot@@ filter .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ ep@@ aton : creates warm bright and medium sounds while he adds a little cold in the she@@ ath . this is very similar to the process of being a printing and re@@ development in an epi@@ epi@@ ph@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) S@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
&quot; with the &amp; checking came ; tools texture , you can apply decorative textures to a picture . &quot;
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can let it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait made from enlarged points or like a m@@ ural on a wall . the menu entry picture is applying the image processing can be used for it . &quot;
&quot; relief : moving this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth , or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of texture on the image . &quot;
a paper text effect is applied on the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and that changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; checking came , tool frame can add a decorative frame to add a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of an eye on the boundaries of a photo is not an easy task . a way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier to the stre@@ et@@ ting eye . under picture frame the module can be added from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , you put the desired options for your image . elaborate the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce converted it with a cute three @-@ dimensional frame of the ideal for a button @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for a button @-@ effect and decorative insert a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : returns the width of the frame per cent . the value area for width is reduced from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target image decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing images , especially when you have used the tool . &quot;
&quot; with this practical tool , you can easily insert a form@@ at@@ ted text into a picture at any place . this also goes to several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply type the text and place it with your mouse . use text selection , orientation , color from the color and the character set with its features like you need . you &apos;ll simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ sighted background . the picture is ready . &quot;
&quot; each setting that you have chosen for your text can be changed , up to the button &apos; OK &apos; . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the picture . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; checking came , tool Sch@@ abl@@ one can apply a sten@@ cil across an image . &quot;
the menu image template used in image processing can be used to place sten@@ cils on one image .
&quot; for the sten@@ cil , there are no restrictions on the size and orientation . however , you need to add the P@@ NG file format and should add with maximum compression ( 9 ) to reduce the file size of the sten@@ cil . if you want to add an email in English to the &amp; checking ; mailing list , and came @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; when you use this tool to first use , you need to put your bar@@ gain folder with the button base folder in dialog . select the folder in which you copied the Sch@@ ab@@ lon@@ gs . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root @-@ level sub@@ folder has been set out for the sten@@ cils appears a construction view , which reflects the folder structure of the sten@@ cil , and the selection of a folder is updated automatically . &quot;
&quot; under the preview , there are three buttons with which you can change the view factor and the position of your image . &quot;
enlarge : this kno@@ b aug@@ ments the picture below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller Re@@ duction : this kno@@ b shr@@ unk the underlying picture . it is cent@@ red around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template on the whole picture , you need to reduce the image according to the mouse . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
use this button to shift the image below the template . take the picture and place it at the desired position .
&quot; use OK , if you want to apply the sten@@ cil to your image . the image will then be automatically adapted to the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&amp; checking came ; produces three different tools for edge . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharp@@ ens is a traditional tool to edge . it is very fast and simple , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ ined images . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness mask works at the contrast of the edges to look at a picture shar@@ per . actually it &apos;s not a bit , it works rather psych@@ o @-@ visual m@@ st . you can use it to remove atmospheric Dun@@ es and it makes a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it &apos;s protected by W@@ inst@@ on Chang . &quot;
&quot; re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three , as it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt . &quot;
&quot; photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of edge . this is because of the dig@@ itali@@ zation of colors , with only minimum differences to a color point . this in turn leads to a common color together . SL@@ R cameras usually require more retro@@ actively focal than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JP@@ EG @-@ images , a camera has often been applied . pictures in the raw format however must always be damaged during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scanner can use a focal filter during the reading of the picture . if you turn off this , you get control of your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get usable results by shar@@ pen@@ ed a photo with the edge of edge value . that allows you to call the menu entry into operation with the menu .
&quot; they should be hereby careful about this , as the results are not very natural : the sharp@@ ness increases the edge of edges , but also increases the noise . in general , you will find more information about the menu entry . below Re@@ focus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to edge . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is cr@@ un@@ chy . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it sharp@@ ens . use the tool to mark the menu entry to the menu entry of the Di@@ alo@@ t shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mas@@ king is a very good tool to remove v@@ eils of your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
&quot; the original image and the preview of the thumb@@ nails will help you edit the picture , showing the output of the filter with the current settings . &quot;
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount ampli@@ fies the effect . if you make the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask to strong , become more noise and impression of gra@@ ding close to sharp edges . &quot;
the radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow greater radi@@ ology . you should therefore raise pictures of the best in their final resolution .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the bl@@ ur@@ red image one of the original added . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the swelling value is a split from the maximum R@@ GB value and the difference amount . one can thus define a minimum difference between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ es . in this way , areas are avoided with a soft change between the killing of shar@@ pen@@ es and therefore beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the un@@ sharp mas@@ king filter . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the edited picture the ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mas@@ king was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a Corpor@@ a = 0.@@ 0 . &quot;
the &amp; publication came ; tool re@@ focused on a picture by improving the edge . it used to be the copyrighted material @-@ algorithm of Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this tool tries to understand a picture &amp; quot ; re@@ focus on the photo ; it is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it is using a technique called F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for depth of pictures is using a sharp@@ ness mask . you can start it out of the menu by calling colors Re@@ focus on image processing .
&quot; in practice the circular F@@ altung works far better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche f@@ ission . the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche F@@ altung has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel , which is far influenced by the original pixel . that causes unwanted results in most cases . &quot;
circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images the default value should set 1 good results . you can bet a higher value if your image is very bl@@ ur@@ red but then on hal@@ ves .
correlation : a increase in the correlation can help reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . the correlation can be chosen by 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg . 0,@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for the correlation reduces the sharp@@ est effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; smoking filter : an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce ar@@ te@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 % . however , values higher than 0.1 % . if the noise filter is too low , the picture quality is very bad . a high value is 0.@@ 03 . a high value will be added even further . &quot;
&quot; Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the Gau@@ ß &apos;@@ sche edge . in most cases , you should use this value in 0 to avoid sensitive arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; mat@@ ric@@ ism : this value determines the size of the Transform@@ ation@@ at@@ rix . an increase in matri@@ arch size can produce good results , especially if you choose great values for the circular edge or the palate &apos;s edge . note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
saving as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameter you have set is thus stored for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all the cuts , color and intention @-@ rec@@ ti@@ tures on the picture before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the image . the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately , but which left un@@ pleasant arti@@ facts . &quot;
&quot; when you read pictures and comp@@ ress , &amp; eg . as JP@@ EG , you should apply the module to the un@@ zi@@ pped image . &quot;
&quot; generally , un@@ sharp mas@@ king produces better results than edge . this could be caused by bl@@ ur@@ red mas@@ king a larger neighborhood than edge . &quot;
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp mas@@ cot always has to remove ar@@ te@@ facts . even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of discomfort . for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter . practical is the result of the F@@ IR Vienna Fil@@ ters always at least as good as the in@@ sharp@@ ness mask . the F@@ IR Wiener Filter is often better when handling small details . &quot;
&quot; below you can see a comparison between the different filters , on a small focused picture , see : &quot;
the original un@@ sharp color picture has to be corrected . this picture was taken with a analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto @-@ focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the methods of focal correction in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English at this address . &quot;
the regul@@ ator smooth@@ ness puts the in@@ sharp@@ ness of the zone which was dark@@ ened to generate a natural charm .
&quot; the colour tin@@ te makes a customized color for the P@@ up@@ ille . if you want blue eyes instead of dark , then you can set it here . &quot;
the tool image error is one of the most advanced tool to remove un@@ requested ar@@ te@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the algorithm algorithm has been developed by IMA@@ GE Team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratory in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different settings as starting points to simplify the restoration . the settings available below are enumer@@ ated below :
&quot; if you want to select the filter preferences from a j@@ us@@ hing , you can use the rider smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; Detailed communication &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to a similar smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should obtain details so that no allo@@ y is necessary . please note that the amount of details always should be sub@@ ordin@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ ding dependency Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value extends even@@ ly in all directions , while a value close to 1 only in one direction . in case you have a high value of wav@@ e@@ similar patterns . JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts are best placed near 1 in close proximity to 1 . &quot;
&quot; &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all else@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore , use this value to the degree of smoking in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : these parameters affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it becomes smooth , as it is difficult to generate geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s effect effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
repetition : returns to how many times the algorithm is going through . usually here 1 or 2 out .
&quot; angle @-@ wide range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if Alpha is selected , there should also be small chosen . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step @-@ wide &#91; 0,@@ 1 , 10 &#93; : integral step towards pixels . you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never bigger than 2 . &quot;
linear inter@@ pol@@ ation use : the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only minor . he doubles the running time . we therefore highly recommend it .
&quot; the buttons save as and store are exactly this . each setting of images can be correct , saved in a text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; graphical errors are compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load after it . hence , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button down@@ fall . &quot;
below you can look like picture error corrected with little arti@@ facts remove . the module is applied on a photo that is made in Guatemala city with a an@@ alog@@ ous camera . as you see there is a peculiar symbol that is caused during the journey . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
the &amp; publication came ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to decrease shots . it uses a protected algorithm by Peter H@@ eck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool presents selected images filters available to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts such as dust or hair on the lens , too . it can also be used to remove sensor rau@@ ds from the camera or mos@@ pher@@ es ; -@@ effects of saved images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information on sensory perception of digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot above shows a typical scene that has been made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ dient smo@@ ker that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following , you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases you only need the sub@@ window details and the sub@@ window advanced settings can stay with default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) , which is used for the filter . large values increase the time that the filters are needed per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image moving across the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and thus minor bugs . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the pix@@ el@@ maker . this value sets the pixels to look forward to det@@ achment . if the value is increased . if the value is too high , the adap@@ tive filter image details can no longer receive and cra@@ w@@ ling or lubric@@ ate again . &quot;
edges : controls the edge @-@ precision for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise . if you want to remove it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove an alert noise or JP@@ EG @-@ arti@@ facts without losing details .
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ osity of the picture . we recommend either to change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
color : controls the color intolerance of the picture . we recommend either to change color or light density to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details -@@ settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the Gam@@ mat@@ ol@@ er@@ anz of the picture . this value can be used to increase the toler@@ anc@@ ill@@ aries of the dark areas , which typically become stronger rou@@ gh@@ tens , but it disappeared as well the shadow . &quot;
&quot; absorption : controls the adjustment of the Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter@@ d@@ amping . this value defines how fast the adap@@ tive filter radius is responding to variation of the lumin@@ ance . if it is elevated , the edges , and Ph@@ as@@ en@@ j@@ itter appear at the edges . he can remove smo@@ other tips and is the recommended method for this . &quot;
&quot; saving under and loading : these buttons are used exactly for them . all parameters for the noise reduction , which you have set , can be stored into the fil@@ esystem and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of how smokers can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) , and the corrected with ( 2 ) is applied with default settings . &quot;
&quot; sometimes a picture is cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw a little soft for your purpose is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use this tool to stream@@ line the menu entry to the menu entry and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the window display on the right of the di@@ alo@@ t shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; publication came ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce phot@@ ographies .
&quot; this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to make Gau@@ ß &apos;s cra@@ wl , film @-@ gra@@ ins , scrat@@ ches , compres@@ sor and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequent digi@@ ti@@ zed pictures . thus the smooth@@ ing takes place along the con@@ tours and thereby gets the content as well as the human eye . &quot;
the same algorithm can be used for color and texture composition . the text suspension is done with another tool , the error correction , carried out . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ v and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JP@@ EG ar@@ te@@ facts reduce : the compression of JP@@ EG is not perfect , in some areas even very far away . as a los@@ sy Com@@ pres@@ sion@@ ary critic , he generates some compression &amp; quot ; arti@@ facts quot ; - small standards that are shown in un@@ zi@@ pped image . this attitude will correct these problems . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and store are exactly this . each setting of photo rest@@ or@@ ation can be saved into a text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo rest@@ or@@ ation is compar@@ atively very fast at work . however , it can still be very long and a high CPU load after you go . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button filling . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with uni@@ form@@ able noise will be restored .. The module is applied to a black and white picture that was recorded with a min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 movie with an sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous movie gra@@ ins on the faces . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected below ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of photo restoration . this time textures was reduced to an old color photo that was applied with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts that were caused by sc@@ ann@@ er@@ lighting and phot@@ op@@ ap@@ ier . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the corrected image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; tool hot@@ pixel allows him to remove hot@@ pixel of photos that have been equipped with a C@@ CD camera , eight have been to be removed . it uses algorithms from the JP@@ EG@@ Pi@@ xi project that are protected by Martin Dick@@ stop@@ over . &quot;
&quot; bright , t@@ ote or hot pixel are especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos a problem since many cameras with JP@@ EG compression to have a built @-@ in repression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; quot ; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark picture sub@@ tract method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the &apos; dark picture . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the picture show .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you take the dark picture directly afterwards to discover new hot or light pixels by C@@ CD def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark picture to the dark picture . an automatic processing of the dark picture will find the bad pixel . please note that the wizard will notice the final image and automatically loads it to the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview help you correct the result within the image . the window display shows the output of the filter with the current settings . poor pixels are taken up in all pre@@ views .
choose an area around the def@@ ective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select then the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ishing these pix@@ el@@ blocks . these are the available filters available :
&quot; Dur@@ ation : it is determined on the average of the neighbouring pixel . the resulting color will be assigned to all def@@ ective pixels on the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is made separately for horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pix@@ el@@ ad will be drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
square : this is the default method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pix@@ el@@ block will be pulled to calculate a bi @-@ square surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the pixels on the block .
Cub@@ an : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn up to calculate a bi @-@ Cub@@ an surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of Cub@@ an curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ishing the def@@ ective pixels on the block .
&quot; below you can see the hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a broken digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image was increased to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image is below ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the checking came ; Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction is a tool to correct the vig@@ net@@ ting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , an image . &quot;
&quot; vast@@ ness , especially the middle and large image format , often the entire sensor range can not be even@@ ly illuminated . instead , &amp; quot ; vig@@ net@@ ting quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they reduce the corners and edges of the picture by reducing the light to the sensor there . tel@@ lenses show also this behavior . &quot;
&quot; but he also has disadvantages . lots of Center @-@ filters need a factor 1,5 or 2 at the leaf filter that it is impossible to keep the camera with the hand . vast@@ ness lenses , an opening of f / 16 or small use , as otherwise un@@ sharp@@ ness effects caused by motion . &quot;
&quot; with the large popularity of today &apos;s fil@@ men@@ ses and shades of digital cameras and film scanner , it is possible to simul@@ ate the effect of a C@@ enter@@ filter by simul@@ ating a equi@@ valence transformation of a raw filter that is applied without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction is applied without this filter . the algorithm is copyrighted by John Walker . &quot;
with three controllers you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ cal filter and with three further exposure of the target image .
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of slideshow at the point of the biggest density the filter . the standard density is 2,@@ 0 , which is a optical filter with an aper@@ ture setting of 1 , or random@@ ly to compens@@ ate for a larger degree of vig@@ net@@ ting , reduce it to compens@@ ate for a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ osity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : the editing of an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ pping correction is reducing the lumin@@ osity of the pixels . you must re@@ configure the exposure of the target image with these options . the controller will only have positive values available , as you only need to increase the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more refinement of the exposure of the target image , let the values for illumin@@ ance / contrast / Gamma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the &amp; checking came ; picture editing from the menu color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of Vig@@ net@@ ti@@ cal correction to a picture used . the original image ( 1 ) shows the correc@@ ting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture . a leu@@ ch@@ increased and contrast correction was also carried out in the image with this tool .
the &amp; publication came ; Lin@@ sen@@ dist@@ ort is a tool to correct the impact of sp@@ herical lenses on photos . it uses a protected algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geom@@ etric distor@@ tions . color@@ less distor@@ tions cannot be corrected with this tool .
the co@@ efficient of the second gra@@ dation covers the general geom@@ etric dis@@ closures of the lens and can correct the con@@ cave or conve@@ x form of the picture .
&quot; the co@@ efficient of the third gra@@ dient has a similar round @-@ effect , fla@@ p but at edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the co@@ efficient fourth gra@@ des corrected the distant corners opposed to that of the second gra@@ dient . if you combine these two can be almost eliminated any geom@@ etric distor@@ tion .
generally : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion of the second gra@@ dient . with negative values can be corrected and positive values of cus@@ hion dis@@ ruption .
&quot; corner : this value controls the strength of the distor@@ tion fourth gra@@ des . this value acts more strongly to the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; verti@@ ces &apos; parameter set the reverse signs of the parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value sc@@ aled the picture size and thereby leads to correction first degree by . negative values enlarge while positive the image are smaller .
bright : this value cre@@ eps the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values reduce the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values they increase .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , illustrated the dialogue with a preview the distor@@ tion correction . the values you use for your image are stored and used at the next start as standard values . &quot;
the ton@@ ic or cus@@ hion correction should be done before all cuts or size changes . best to cut this correction than all the first . if you want to re@@ cut a picture and then perform a high @-@ shaped correction would be the effect evi@@ dently of the Fal@@ sche .
&quot; to help you find the best correction to you , this tool displays a vertical and horizontal relief line . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . after connection , you can correct the t@@ onal / cus@@ hion co@@ er@@ cion with the help of the lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cus@@ hion @-@ shaped distor@@ tion , the resulting image becomes black corners . you can remove it using the cutting tools in the menu Transform@@ ating from the image processing or via the zoom re@@ controller of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; for most images , the tone @-@ shaped correction is made . the next logical step for some moti@@ fs such as recordings from the front , frame and paintings , it is the perspective to correct that all angles in the picture 90 degrees . please note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight embarrass@@ ment of perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton@@ ic correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method of simul@@ ating infr@@ a Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is accessible under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) S@@ FX@@ 200 I@@ infr@@ a film , see this URL . &quot;
&quot; in the left of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
&quot; below the preview , you can adjust two parameters to simul@@ ate film bas@@ kets as well as film hyper@@ sensitivity ( ISO ) . the ISO @-@ regul@@ ator changes the amount of gra@@ ins and the dominance of colour green ( chlor@@ ophyll in nature ) in conversion . green fields are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; given the filter channels to reproduce from infrared film , especially the green canal does not make any sense to apply the effect on black / white photos as the color formations are missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared fil@@ tered applied to a landscap@@ ing photo from New Zealand . the original image is under ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . higher ISO values generate a kind of au@@ ra in the s@@ ut@@ ch@@ men .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter movie gra@@ ins is an easy to use tool to reproduce film bas@@ kets as e.g. the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X , known as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of movies by the manufacturer of large silver @-@ gra@@ ins of the phot@@ em@@ ul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the cinem@@ atic effect gives your photo a certain atmosphere , or seems to move back into the past . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gran@@ ular sight specifically in your mono@@ chro@@ men photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regul@@ ator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the gran@@ ules . standard value is , although frequently higher values need to be adjusted to ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need even more gra@@ ins , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the cinem@@ at@@ rop@@ ic effects on a black / white picture applied . the original picture is the ( 1 ) and the used ( 2 ) . the used film hyper@@ sensitivity is equivalent to ISO @-@ 1600 .
&quot; the &amp; checking came , filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a protected protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
the &amp; checking came ; filter oil painting gives your digital images a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature images and styles are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper chooses the height between one and five out . thicker brushes are better suited for big pictures . thicker brushes are better suited for big pictures . smooth controlled the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the jack@@ ets . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original image is marked with the ( 1 ) and that is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush @-@ size for this 640 pixels large picture is 1 and smooth@@ ie 17 .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter coal @-@ drawing uses color and Inten@@ sity gra@@ dient to define a coher@@ ence in the drawing . the lines of gra@@ dients into drawing are slowly , therefore not ideal for this effect . it &apos;s helpful if you would like to imagine what scene you would have chosen to sk@@ ate you . this would be good pictures to start . &quot;
there are two regul@@ ator with a value range from 1 to 100 to control this effect . the top regul@@ ator chooses the foundation size and the lower j@@ us@@ its the contrast ( smooth@@ y ) .
this is an example of the carbon filter filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the altered image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be improved even further by adapting the intention value .
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it appears in wax . it uses a protected algorithm of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; checking came ; filter engra@@ ving is a fast tool to restore your pictures with a 3 @-@ D effect . he works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important thing . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ opoli@@ tical landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows the contrast to the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engra@@ ving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filtering group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork by means of distor@@ ting effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
&quot; wav@@ el@@ blocks 1 : divide the image into cells , and makes it look as if it is seen through flas@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; wav@@ el@@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 , the image here is distorted in a different version of glass @-@ blocks . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button filling .
with this filtering group you can transform a normal picture into an artwork by means of un@@ sharp@@ ness effects . it uses protected algorithms of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image along st@@ ern@@ fo@@ m@@ iger lines that go from a center . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a zo@@ oming camera and creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ red the image by rotation of the pixels by a focus . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a revol@@ ving camera .
removal : bl@@ ur@@ red the image to create the effect of a not focused camera lens . the object seems to step back into the background .
&quot; movement bl@@ ur@@ red : bl@@ ur@@ red the image through horizontal moti@@ ons of pixels . this simul@@ ates the un@@ sharp@@ ness of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train photographed , camera . &quot;
soft pla@@ que in@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focuss@@ ed ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ or photos or to add a warm and subtle light . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ un@@ sharp@@ ness : wi@@ ped the picture by random shift of pixels and simul@@ ates the in@@ sharp@@ ness of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent un@@ sharp@@ ness : finds the color sink in the picture and wi@@ red this without changing the rest .
&quot; a@@ mos@@ aic : shares the photo in rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . you can therefore cancel this calculation at any time with the button filling .
the reg@@ iment are a nice little tool to make rain drops on your picture . this gives it natural to your pictures a physical appearance . it uses one of Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n copyrighted algorithm .
&quot; trou@@ gh size allows the size of tro@@ p to change . as the dro@@ plet size does not grow automatically with the size of the picture , it is often necessary to reduce the size and density of drops . fish changes the op@@ tic effect of drops on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can hold with the &amp; checking ; image processing a area free of rain drops . use the choice tool to select the area , for example a face , which is supposed to stay free . if you start afterwards the filter drops , the area will remain free of rain drops . &quot;
this is an example of a reg@@ ress filter . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a calm sunset and the edited picture ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the standard values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can fix it by mir@@ rors or rotating in the right orientation . the tools can be found in the menu Transform@@ ating Dre@@ w or Transform@@ ations . &quot;
photo infl@@ atable is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo in a minimum loss of image quality .
&quot; to reduce a picture is simple . the big question is , how can you get a picture bub@@ bles and keep the details sharp ? how can you find the missing information back or gu@@ essed ? the C@@ Im@@ g @-@ algorithm is used here , makes a good work . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
if a picture has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . select to change dimensions in the menu and enter the target values . the dialog is shown below .
&quot; the tool for size change uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to increase the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ atable . &quot;
many image processing programs use a type of inter@@ pol@@ ation ( e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge an image . &amp; checking came ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo infl@@ atable was developed by the IMA@@ GE team of the G@@ REC CN@@ RS laboratories in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
you must tell the tool as you want to change the size . these settings are available in the rider New size and are enumer@@ ated below :
&quot; aspect ratio maintained : if this option is enabled , when entering the new size is maintained the aspect ratio of the original image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : these parameters affects larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it becomes smooth , as it is difficult to generate geometry of the picture . even if you want to generate a &apos; van Gogh &apos;s effect effect , it must be higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and store are used exactly for this purpose . each inser@@ tion for photo enlarge can be saved as text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; photo infl@@ atable is very fast at what it does , but it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU burden . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button filling . &quot;
&quot; you can see below an example for photo shooting , adding a small color picture to double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged image ( 3 ) is the result of linear standard enlargement to compare . &quot;
&quot; cutting of a photo is not just a frequently performed surgery , but also a commonly underestimated tool to create a picture . the image processing allows you to create a photo with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and drag the rect@@ angle , create this rect@@ angle then you &apos;ll see while you move the mouse . &quot;
if you leave the mouse button again release the area of the photos will be cut off . you can change the size of the cut area by clicking the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle generate by clicking the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the section , use the button @-@ cutting @-@ button in tool@@ bar and the photo is tailored ( C@@ tr@@ l ; + X ) . use the file File Save or File save in the menu File to save the newly cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview range , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in dialogue will remain intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool to cut aspect ratio , you can indicate the orientation as high @-@ format or cross @-@ format . in the high @-@ format the greater value of height and the width @-@ format is allocated . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio is used to cut a relative side ratio . that means that it is always the same , regardless of whether you are cen@@ tim@@ etres , in@@ ch or any other physical size . you can see below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ ier and their aspect ratio . &quot;
at the right end of the dialogue there are two buttons to set the selection automatically horizont@@ ally or ver@@ tically .
&quot; in dialogue with the max . ratio in the range for cutting on the maximum possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool can be cut by side ratio depends on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ ont@@ ally or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting @-@ tool to the next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on the orientation . the changed image measurements are reflected in the EX@@ IF tables , so that the EX@@ IF data are reflected and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the set @-@ up assistance allow help to help you put your images better . these help are :
&quot; harmon@@ ic triangle : harmon@@ ic ponds are based on the principle of similarity . as the third el@@ re@@ gel , harmon@@ ic triangles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle in similar harmon@@ ic triangles . &quot;
Golden Center : the Golden Center is a division which is on various natural growth patterns like e.g. the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us sea or the sm@@ el@@ ets of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things we feel as beautiful .
&quot; the golden division is the ir@@ rational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used already with the ancient Egyptians and Greeks that allow us to build your temples and pyr@@ ami@@ ds . artists and architects built the golden division in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acci sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 21 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 , 34 &quot;
the golden middle represents li@@ que@@ fied aid lines when you put an image together . these help are enumer@@ ated below :
the Golden spiral will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ party the golden spiral creates a liquid line that will follow the eye through the image . this type of composition leads the view of the be@@ holder along the line of the spiral and creates at this way a balanced visual flow .
&quot; another rule , the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called Golden S@@ ons . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the Golden spiral . this can be a line or different objects . this one can only be there without the eye , it will fulfil its purpose . &quot;
the Golden triangles are also from the top discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the middle points of the sides of the golden area . keep in mind that in contrast to harmon@@ ic triangles , Golden triangles are not equivalent to these lines . di@@ ag@@ onal object can be placed more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden triangles to break down your frame and create a effect of professional photographers dynamic symm@@ etry . try your image focus on one of the intersection and other visual information to place in the triangles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot reach any other way .
the options Horiz@@ ont@@ ally and vertical are can be used to reflect the harmon@@ ic ponds .
&quot; with the button colour , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the aid lines can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines of your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rot@@ ate an image to any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , then it happens easily that you are not connected with the camera exactly ver@@ tically or horizont@@ ally . this creates an image in which things turned into a corner . you can fix it with the &amp; checking ; picture editing and the tool free rotation . choose to convert free rot@@ ation and j@@ us@@ hing the destination corner . &quot;
rot@@ ate your image with the sli@@ der angle . the values on this sli@@ der are specified in degrees . with the button preferences you can set the sli@@ der back to 0 degrees . a preview of rotation is displayed on the right of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the right .
&quot; to your help , the module Free Rot@@ ation provides a horizontal and a vertical line . move the cursor in the picture show around the two lines . after you fix it on an important point of the picture , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now j@@ us@@ ate the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; once you shot an image , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to repair this is the function transform@@ ating from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to cut the picture is the automatic cutting edge . select one of the following options :
&quot; however , the option Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing gives the picture a bit after rotation . however , please note the above warning . &quot;
all per@@ spec@@ ulative transformations are conducted at a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is represented in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares to the corners of your picture . the preview is then automatically calculated . on the right of the dialogue you will find some information which will help you to change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created through the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
&quot; new height : shows the height of the new image , including the empty areas that were created through the transformation , in pixel . &quot;
angle left : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right above : shows the current angle in degrees at the top right of the transformed area .
angle on the left : displays the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle on the right bottom : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after the adaptation of the perspective , the image becomes a bit wasted . for a single adaptation this effect is small , but two adjustments produce a twice as strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after having adjusted the perspective , you will get un@@ pleasantly tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to wi@@ pe it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ations from the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ ing tool is used to move a part of the picture into one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is no rotation , the image will be distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle becomes transformed into a parall@@ elo@@ gram . you can start this module over transformations . &quot;
set your picture by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can push horizont@@ ally and ver@@ tically at the same time . if you push to pres@@ ets the angle is displayed on zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nails .
&quot; to your help , a vertical and horizontal line appears . move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool@@ ing tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have performed the mould , the image becomes a bit bl@@ ur@@ red . for a single melting this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two variations generated twice as much si@@ blings and hence you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the shot , the image has un@@ nice tri@@ angular holes in the corners . a way to eliminate it is to cut the picture with Transform@@ ations from the picture editing . &quot;
&quot; checking has come ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . therefore , the available formats then depend on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are comp@@ uted . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of images formats with &amp; checking ; &quot;
&quot; due to this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all available file formats on this site . however , you will always find JP@@ EG and TI@@ FF below . &quot;
&quot; &amp; checking came ; displays only files in formats where the file is specified . if the extension is listed in the list , &amp; checking came , the file in image processing is displayed . you can change this list of file exten@@ ders the &amp; checking ; accepted . in the configuration you will find more information . &quot;
nearly all digital cameras save photos in one of two formats : JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF . some cameras allow you even to select the format used . a more detailed description of this file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; publication came ; supports both formats .
image compression is the use of data sets on digital images . thereby redund@@ ant information is reduced in order to save the image data to a more efficient way .
JP@@ EG 2000 is also supported . generally there is better to store smo@@ other results than JP@@ EG in the same comp@@ pres@@ sion@@ ment . the 200@@ 0s version can also be los@@ s@@ free when it is stated in the settings .
&quot; if you want to know more about the raw material format , you can read from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous service and Cambridge in Col@@ our very helpful instructions in English . you can find raw @-@ format images in JP@@ EG or TI@@ FF with the raw @-@ image verter of &amp; checking ; convert . in the configuration you will find further information on the use of modules with &amp; checking ; . &quot;
&quot; checking came ; supports the load of raw pictures only with the program d@@ cra@@ w , which was included in &amp; checking ; they will see more than 200 raw @-@ dat@@ ei@@ ves . all support cameras can be shown below on the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a brief list of raw formats used by &amp; checking ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are frequently saved in Avi@@ - or MPEG @-@ Format . however , these formats and will look up for films . &amp; publication came ; but when you click on a movie file and checking out ; the &amp; k@@ de ; attitudes to play films to start playing the program . &quot;

&quot; if you exchange steps 4 and 5 , what you can do well if the initial contrast was very good , then you can perform the first four steps with the whit@@ e@@ el module . &quot;
many tools you need the photo processing are in &amp; checking ; included . your description follows here .
&quot; all image processing tools such as sharp@@ ens , soft characters , ro@@ ot@@ ings , re@@ focus , im@@ pe@@ ze , un@@ sharp , &amp; etc . use a uniform di@@ alogs before the filter is applied to the current image before the filter is applied to the current image . below you can see &amp; quot ; texture applicable ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . links of it allow five buttons to change the comparative mode of the thumb@@ nails . these modes are :
ver@@ tically share without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the left area shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the field on the right of the selected pres@@ et area .
horizontal without dup@@ lic@@ ates . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected pres@@ et area .
ver@@ tically share . the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizontal . the upper area shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the thumb@@ nails , and otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons you can turn on to show over@@ - and over@@ exposure . the colors used may be adjusted in the general installation site .
&quot; ( 3 ) : the frame for the selection of the thumb@@ nails . you can drop this frame with the mouse within the image and drop in the part of the picture , from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog is instantly updated . &quot;
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons on your default values . all entries from the last use of the module will be noticed .
the side@@ bar tab shows the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explained . it is group@@ ed in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data originates from the EX@@ IF data if this is available .
&quot; this rider provides an intuitive card@@ search tool , based on the Mar@@ ble @-@ Mini@@ ature program . you can press the mouse button in order to drop a square . all pictures within these coordinates are fil@@ tered and displayed . of course , this requires your images of Ge@@ o data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for p@@ allets files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for select and naming colors .
&quot; the p@@ allets files , which are installed by &amp; k@@ de ; are either applicable to the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed p@@ allets or search for files . &quot;
cursor is displayed in the p@@ allet view as a line . it can be moved by cool@@ ed to the area next to a colour .
it shows the color of it . the color is described under the p@@ allet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; it can also be used to choose from . to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor . then move the mouse to the pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the tick box is activated by cursor in the button color , the color is inserted out of the color board on the cursor . the color is either inserted or over@@ writes a different ; depending on whether the mode has been selected . this mode can be set by selecting the tick @-@ panel under Bot@@ h C@@ ursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that has been created as described in the last section , can be used together with the actions copying , cutting and inser@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; S@@ color@@ edit : uses the following format for data in the cli@@ p@@ board : for each color follows three values for the shares of red , green and blue , and a optional colour name , followed by a pointer type . if the other color values are in the cli@@ p@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; color@@ edit . &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be drawn with the mouse .
select a color somewhere on the screen and then find them in the color pi@@ vot@@ er on the left side .
&quot; graphical viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; -@@ dot ; graphs are free layout programs . graphs are available in science , especially in computer science . so far there was no modern &amp; GUI ; - program to visu@@ alize graphs . the programs , the &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; - or &amp; t@@ cl@@ t@@ k ; programs with only a few functions . &quot;
the &amp; graphical viewer ; project has set itself the aim of replacing these programs with a modern and user @-@ friendly graphical interface with all functions of a well integrated &amp; col@@ de ; program .
&amp; k@@ graphic viewer : is a K@@ DE program for viewing &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; -@@ dot ; graphs . the &amp; graphical viewer ; displays grap@@ her with all the possibilities of a well integrated &amp; box ; program in a modern and user @-@ friendly &amp; GUI ; it has the following functions :
integration in &amp; K@@ ate ; and &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change in the graph in &amp; K@@ ate ; the graph@@ ene re@@ calculated and in &amp; graphic viewer ; )
menu to open the graph@@ ene in &amp; K@@ ate ; to open or the graph@@ ene in &amp; graphic viewer ; in one &amp; K@@ ate ; component to open
&quot; load from large graphs ( currently there are problems from about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack , to present more than these knot@@ s ) &quot;
&quot; further required software : &amp; graph@@ ene ; is a &amp; b ; -@@ program , which pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; -@@ tool &amp; dot ; for the presentation of graphs . required in detail : &quot;
&quot; the main window shows the opened graphs , each in a separate sub@@ window . in the beginning , if you start &amp; graph@@ ene ; without an argument , the main window will open just the symbol file and the ( blank ) list of Last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; after you have selected one or more of the dot , the main window looks like at the bottom of the scre@@ enshot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview in the corner is displayed when the graph is bigger than the string . you can select a fixed position of this summary with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; the mouse @-@ wheel use ( high and down without special ta@@ sts , left and right in pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
the zo@@ oming is restricted in both directions by the factor 10 . below you can see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; when the file used in &amp; graphic viewer , loaded a file from another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged , or whether you want to change the change , so that later the procedure is applied . if you want to change your decision later , you can set up the menu settings settings ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; when you open an graph outside of an ongoing &amp; graphic viewer ; instance , &amp; eg . in the file browser or at the command line , you have the choice whether you want to open a new &amp; graphic viewer , or want to show the load@@ able graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instances . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the furnishing dialog . &quot;
&quot; at the program start , you can open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
&quot; you can also specify how the Grap@@ h should be divided into several pages , the number of horizontal and vertical sites can be chosen freely . &quot;
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph , which are to be displayed on a page , the aspect ratio is ignored . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page show with one on several pages shared graphs with no head@@ line and with another font .
&quot; the page once again gives the opportunity to set the behavior if a file has been changed on the hard disk , &amp; eg , by another program . you can set a standard behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the page Open gives the possibility to specify the behavior of &amp; graphical viewers . you can set a standard behavior for this case ( the graph@@ ene in a new window open or , in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) , or determine that each time is asked . &quot;
&quot; the site administration provides the possibility to specify the process behavior of &amp; cant@@ onal viewer . you can set a standard behavior ( the files of the last session , or not ) , or determine if you start to start it . &quot;
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a click on the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n window , opens up additional features : &quot;
here you can choose among different &amp; graphi@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ layers algorithms . the entries as they are described on the website of &amp; Graphi@@ cal ; are :
&quot; &amp; dot ; algorithm , the standard for orient@@ ated graphs . it produces hierarch@@ ical or lay@@ ered depic@@ tions of directed graph@@ ene . the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and then try to produce as short edges and as few as possible . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato , algorithm is the standard for non @-@ directed graph@@ ene . it produces depic@@ tions under the spr@@ ing@@ point model . thereby the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wai algorithm uses , the syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimension@@ ally sc@@ aling . &quot;
the &amp; F@@ DP ; algorithm created for ung@@ ed graphs a jumping @-@ point model -@@ layout . it uses the fru@@ ct@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ mo@@ ver for the treatment of large and ge@@ clu@@ ders graph . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; cir@@ co ; algorithm sorts the node @-@ shaped due to the description of Six and Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ eur and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ c structures . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog in which you can specify a layout command , which is then accepted by a shell . the command should give the graph@@ ite to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command you can change &amp; eg . the algorithms special options , or also change the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; determines the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ ed ) and uses the standard algorithms for each type of ( dot ; for orient@@ ated , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for executed graph@@ ene ) . &quot;
&quot; if this option is activated , the overview is displayed as long as this is necessary . otherwise it is not shown and the position menu is in@@ active . &quot;
displays the What is the mouse cursor . click with this pointer of mouse on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get further assistance to this item ( if available ) .

the K@@ IP@@ I module images ein@@ gs displays the tools available to read new pictures and to get to access it .
&quot; this module can be used to read and increase new images from external sources . currently , two sources can be used : &quot;
images scan : uses the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supported by the SA@@ NE project or another source such as video Stre@@ ams . that this works you will have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and SA@@ NE .
&quot; when you scan the pictures to the menu entry , a dialog that allows you to select between all available sources on your computer . choose here the source of which you want to get the picture . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by adding its own standard duc@@ duc@@ er to select your image according to the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be shown to you in the right , bottom corner . in K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find further information . &quot;
&quot; note that the window will be completely shown , as some settings are not displayed otherwise . &quot;
&quot; after you have pushed the button scanning , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to commemor@@ ate the options of the image file . here you can select the compression and type of image file . you must also select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create the image saved . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery @-@ export is a tool to export your image collection to a gallery server
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows the GPS coordinates in the met@@ adata of a picture to add and edit . geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ key@@ word of the picture , and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical loc@@ alisation makes tools available to locate images of ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the sp@@ herical coordination system , which is used by GPS and Galileo . height , long@@ itu@@ dinal and lati@@ tudes are used in this process . &quot;
&quot; to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographical data , you need a GPS track as XML file in g@@ p@@ x @-@ fork . g@@ p@@ s@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ p@@ sman can download and convert the data for you from your GPS equipment . &quot;
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; choose the pictures that you want to cor@@ relate in the main window , and call the menu . the above mentioned dialog box appears . to load a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a column file with GP@@ X file , including the images of your camera . &quot;
if the file is loaded a automatic correlation which displays coordinates in red . GPS sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT @-@ time and therefore the camera data is expected to be calculated with the time zone . this can be done with the time@@ zone .
&quot; the setting for the maximum time vari@@ ance gives an upper devi@@ ation for the GPS time and camera time . lies the devi@@ ation below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you do not have sp@@ ur@@ data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the g@@ p@@ x file manually and add pictures to the pictures . the difference in 2000 seconds then will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ishing and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have the appropriate data . if you know that in reality , a loc@@ alization appears in a great time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then push the button cor@@ relate to the inter@@ pol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually using this dialog . this is useful , if you have made a number of photos on the same place . since the dialog box takes the coordinates of a call to the next , you just need to use the button OK to put the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; location can also be found and set with the shown map and enlarge . choose the relevant region and enlarge you si@@ e.@@ Run this over and over again , until you &apos;ve achieved a sufficient accuracy . the map may be manually selected between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
complete outside the K@@ IP@@ I module there are ways to hang GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that the ex@@ i@@ ft@@ ool is used to provide a stack of images with GPS data .
the K@@ IP@@ I module image gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums into a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that can be exported to HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set will enable UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
the module has four horse@@ men in which the settings can be downloaded . the tab is allowed to select all the albums that can be exported to HTML . you &apos;ll find these albums only . the albums are not hierarch@@ ically shown . with the three buttons on the right you can quickly appear a large number of albums . with the three buttons on the right , you can quickly appear a large number of albums on the right side . the albums will appear in the header part of the HTML page . &quot;
&quot; the rider appearance defines the general look and layout for each page . this rider is largely self @-@ explained . the option is displayed for each image as well . if you then click on an image , a new page will be displayed in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image is displayed directly with your default image , &amp; eg . Ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , displayed &quot;
&quot; the rider album defines the settings where and how the gallery will be saved with all your related images . select a folder from which you write permission . a sub@@ folder containing the name K@@ IP@@ I@@ k@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you selected the JP@@ EG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images are also stored in the new pictures . &quot;
&quot; with Other colours , you can change the color depth . of course the file size also influences . all other settings are expl@@ ain@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the rider thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album rider for the thumb@@ nails , which are small images displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user as far as the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not automatically be closed . you can therefore start the program@@ el@@ ds to determine if bugs have been performed during the generation . the web@@ browser will automatically start at the end to preview the gallery . press Sch@@ mit to lock the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image is a very fast and flexible OpenGL @-@ based tool to view images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image makes it possible to view a selection of images and using basic operations like rotation , zo@@ oming or reloc@@ ating . the viewer is missing with short @-@ time and mouse spec@@ s . it has been developed for quick imaging and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed by default in full screen mode . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JP@@ EG loss @-@ free module is a tool to change pictures without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below , images in the JP@@ EG format , without the usual loss of quality or met@@ adata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of the loss of losses is that the file size increases , since there is no compression of the color formations . this can be found e.g. at the P@@ NG format . &quot;

&quot; with the import -@@ function of the met@@ adata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image files then you want to copy the file name , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the met@@ adata . the data will be copied after you have pushed the button OK . &quot;
this function does not work in all picture formats . you can copy from anywhere but not in any destination format . JP@@ EG is supported by writing . please take a look at ex@@ i@@ v@@ 2 to see which formats are supported .
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ ding module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a gas@@ h@@ au .
&quot; the module MPEG enco@@ ders can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length to convert . this module can add the packages M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . between the individual images you can add a base training course . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or W@@ AV devices . &quot;
all pictures will be sc@@ aled automatically to the correct size for the video format . additionally you can choose a background color for the slide . with this module it is possible to use the formats DVD / XV@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD to your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program .
&quot; first , you must first choose the pictures that are to be packed into the MPEG gas@@ h@@ au . after that , you can create the module via ex@@ tras MPEG Di@@ las@@ au . &quot;
the images you selected are then enumer@@ ated under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change the images or the content of the list .
&quot; once you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from different formats , DVD , XV@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . PAL is pre @-@ adjusted and most probably the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; next step , you should indicate the time in seconds that is displayed a picture . the speed of the image is set . a low value generates very sudden , high on the very smooth image change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be adjusted as next . in doubt , you should let it be black . the name and the path of the created file you can specify under the name of the MPEG output file . keep up as possible as possible as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify a audio file under the name of the audio source file , then this will be integrated into the movie . depending on the speed of your computer you can now start drinking coffee and enjoy the th@@ ash@@ au if you are back again . &quot;
&quot; if a note appears that co@@ den@@ ers or tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ pe@@ g@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages to the right below . &quot;
&quot; the print assistant allows several images to print on a piece of paper together in standard photo@@ sizes . the combined pictures can also be automatically opened with the image processing . this is e.g. useful to improve , or print with the Gimp module to the direct expression . &quot;
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module , you can import or convert your images in the RA@@ W format for one of three formats JP@@ EG , TI@@ FF , or P@@ PM . &quot;
&quot; conversion is based on the command @-@ line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original picture of Him is , do not expect the same results as the software from your cam@@ aher@@ ero . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ b better results ! &quot;
first select the RA@@ W file that is to be converted and launch the module . the Ra@@ w image kon@@ verter window appears in the mode for a single image . with the button preview you can view the effect of your current settings in the picture .
&quot; you can now re@@ configure the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings can be used immediately for the white lines . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be changed . if the result is not optimal you can edit the picture later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ GB@@ G conversion can be selected so that you can use the contra@@ sting information . if your camera is working in R@@ GB mode , the R@@ GB@@ G switches has no effect . &quot;
once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . JP@@ EG remains the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JP@@ EG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; tagged image format , TI@@ FF , reserves all the information of your image and uses loss of free L@@ Z@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you are planning to edit your pictures frequently or later on otherwise you should not be able to use the JP@@ EG format , as it is allowed only a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ated . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
in case you select JP@@ EG as storage format the met@@ adata contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JP@@ EG file in the EX@@ IF data .
&quot; when you have adjusted your settings , you can start to execute the conversion button . if you want to break the process again , you can break it off . &quot;
&quot; processing mode mode allows you to convert different images to once . use this mode for instance , if you are sure , for example , through testing in a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images . however , you have the possibility of writing existing file automatically . however , this is helpful in case it has been created in an earlier attempt . a preview is not available , but the progress bar is progres@@ sed as far the conversion has progres@@ sed . &quot;
this module can be used to convert all images in an album . it uses the program to convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of a record . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start and tim@@ est@@ amp of the record . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of a picture collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . you can reduce the image smaller or enlarge . these measures are made available to four types of picture change :
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in a dimension . the width or height of the image is automatically selected , depending on the image orientation , the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : res@@ isting in two dimensions . here , the aspect ratio is unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to the screen format . &quot;
not proportional : not dis@@ proportionate size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed during this option .
&quot; preparation : preparing the image for the photo print . the user can adjust the print resolution and the size of the photo paper . the target image , including back@@ size , Rand@@ size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected images to your favorite email program . it is also possible to change the size of the added images previously . further pictures can be drawn up to the list of images below and there .
&quot; once you have started the module , the images window will be displayed with the pictures selected by you . using the button images you can add more images via the button . for the last picture , a preview is displayed on the right . &quot;
you can also drag pictures to the picture list and place there to add a list of images to the images below .
with the button images you will remove the selected images from the list of images too .
&quot; once you have selected all pictures , you can open the new message window to your e @-@ mail clients with the button OK . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the images you select have already attached attached . &quot;
do not pay attention to many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have limitations for the size of sending e @-@ mails . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails when you want to send many pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is stored and re@@ used every time you change it .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail clients from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the right path for your installation in the input field . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after the selection of comments in a attached file , the comments to the images are added together into a text file and the mail attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the menu images file format is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it &apos;s best adapted among losses free formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG , if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise , we recommend you the JP@@ EG format . &quot;
if you select JP@@ EG under images file format and add the original files in the JP@@ EG format then the original ex@@ i@@ f@@ ates are added to the visu@@ alized images .
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not be closed automatically so you can view the status messages in search of errors , however . your e @-@ mail program will be started automatically at the end . with the button Connect , you can slide this window . &quot;
after starting the module Advanced Di@@ asch@@ au a window with questions like you want to have shown your slides . you can choose between the pictures selected by you and select all pictures of the album .
&quot; the OpenGL over@@ transi@@ tions in the presentation are enabled very elegant sc@@ rolling through OpenGL . however , you need to have an appropriate graphics board , as otherwise the gas@@ h@@ au will be very slow . &quot;
the option file name indicates that the file name is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in a final loop . you can then manually break it with Es@@ c .
&quot; the option images happen to suit random@@ ly , that the images are shown in a random order . so it will not be the order of the pictures in the album . &quot;
under delay between the pictures the temporary distance between the individual images can be placed . 1500 mill@@ ise@@ con@@ ds match 1.5 seconds and are a good standard . the best distance depends however on your computer and your chosen transition effect . you should therefore show that before you show the presentation to your friends !
&quot; there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . random@@ ly , choosing a different effect at every transition between images . &quot;
&quot; during the Sli@@ deshow , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top of the screen . move the mouse into this corner to switch it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar , you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next image and stop the slides . &quot;
&quot; at the left side of the screen , you can view the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; currently , the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date has no documentation . in case you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de imaging @ k@@ de.@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to put an image as a background image for the surface of the surface .
&quot; this module sets the currently selected image , depending on the select option of the sub@@ menu , as a background for your K@@ DE working surface . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided your pictures and videos with notes , you can see with &amp; on photo@@ album ; through this brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the image are now available in each group , thus in individuals , places and within the group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window you will see the categories that you have entered in for more information than you have received your pictures and videos with notes . additionally , there are entries to look at EX@@ IF @-@ based information to look at the folder structure on your hard drive and of course to see the current thumb@@ nails . in the following , each one is described for each other . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse to the entry person , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
if you select another person only the pictures are displayed on which both individuals are visible . by this selection method you can limit the number of images shown by a few thousand pictures on a few individual images .
&quot; when you have selected all the persons , places and other settings , you can view images to view images of your account . &quot;
&quot; in the picture every person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can store with &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album , but of course for each person you have their own image , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories which you have defined yourself . see this picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images beside the name , select the button , which is right outside on the tool@@ bar . on the appearing context menu , you can select which view can be displayed for each category separately . this has the advantage that you can see for example symbols with images of people and at the same time display a list of keywords ( if you do not have appropriate pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide which image is to display for each individual person . to do so , you have to select the image An@@ si@@ eve window ( in closer described ) and select the image panel to suit your wishes , and select which part of the image will be displayed and cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the entry for entry in the main window , a dialog will appear , which is very similar to dialogue for the soli@@ ds of the image properties . this dialog can be viewed even once more . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the cap@@ tion or description , the sign@@ ments and descriptions of the images may be searched for this text . if you wish , you can also be a part of the total date , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a section of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all images by certain names as you can see in the picture . here , by pictures , on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the manual book for &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; if you do not like to read hand@@ books , but prefer to try some features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , and take a look at the quick@@ board , the screen photos and the introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; launch &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; and select in the first dialogue the demo , if you start &amp; on photo@@ album ; for the first time , or select in the menu Help the menu entry on photo@@ album ; -@@ demo . as a result , some examples will be loaded and you can try the functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you will find it on the homepage of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album , as a consistent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this trail , see here : . as its name suggests , this list will show you data statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can display several different time units . each track then displays another unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . on the picture you can see a part of a database by pointing the le@@ bar only 10 @-@ minute sections . &quot;
&quot; the time bar can be inter@@ actively used on the following ways : you can select the indicated entries view from the database ( if you select a date , the first image is displayed in the preview image ) and furthermore the tim@@ eline is always shown the current date of the currently shown images , when you navigate in the Pre@@ view View . &quot;
&quot; you can also select an area of the time bar by pressing the mouse button down and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , so if you select an area , you will in the preview view only pictures of this time@@ frame . you can break the selection by clicking on a beams of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; displays two possibilities available to create HTML @-@ websites with your pictures . one is integrated in &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version described in &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album , integrated version , which you can create via the HTML @-@ HTML menu . &quot;
&quot; before HTML @-@ Pages you will have to make some settings . these are divided into the three areas of content , layout and goal . in the following , each area is described more accurately . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the clip and a description that should contain the HTML file later . on photo@@ album , HTML @-@ example pages you will see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is created ; export file is to be seen on the review page . nutritional information about export files can be found in . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is displayed on the HTML pages . by this way , you can avoid that information is shown , the viewer also without descriptions are obvious . please note that all pictures are exported from a party . you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain pictures from certain views . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML @-@ pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why this is not specifically made . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set up various resolutions on the images . by doing so , those who have viewing your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no more pictures , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer &apos;s viewer may change the resolution at any time you set . so it can search your pictures with low resolution , which results in a lower transmission time . if he would like to see a picture bigger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you place the different folders and URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; preferably , select a basic folder for all of your HTML files , and for each subsequent set a new sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically supported by the next time . by this , you can select either a folder or one from K@@ DE supported protocol , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your pictures , you can check whether this really all is visible for the viewer . if you have created a URL for the basic folder , after the pages have been created , this folder should be . otherwise , the web browser will launch in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet defined in the final destination folder , you need to manually copy them manually . therefore , the import function , see correctly works you will have to specify the final destination of the files , but the basic folder in which all sub@@ folders . &quot;
&quot; the exactly described settings will have covered all three on basic folders and URLs . in this one sub@@ folder , whose name you can specify in the output folder . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for a family party , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; come together , you might want to use a HTML @-@ page to look at the pictures , entrance , etc . , then you have to do with &amp; on photo@@ album ; do not even make this work once again . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album , you can export a copy of your images into a .@@ k@@ im file . you can import others into your database . the imaging features are using ex@@ - and imported . &quot;
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the pictures themselves are stored in the file or whether in the file you have only one short@@ cut to pictures . the advantage of all images to be stored in the file is that you can share all pictures together and pass this file independently . however , the obvious downside is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the menu File Export ... or together with HTML @-@ Pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with a HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ im file is searching for the images that are in the folder of .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding pictures are not found , the images of the URL you have indicated using the HTML files . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for the export of pictures is described , which you can call from the menu Ex@@ porting ... &quot;
the main option of this dialogue is whether it is to act by internal or external .@@ k@@ im files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; at the option manual near the .@@ k@@ im file , you need to copy the pictures to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
&quot; with the option Autom@@ atic in the vicinity of the .@@ k@@ im file , copy &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; the pictures are automatic for you . &quot;
.@@ k@@ im files are normal Zip files . since most images have already been compressed to JP@@ EG and the XML file itself is very small is it usually not to comp@@ ress the files . if you still want this to simply select the option Export file .
&quot; the last option of this page is maximum picture size . if you want to send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures very big , as the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big , for example , you can say that each image is high 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the menu file imports ... select , becomes &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for the import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , afterwards , in which folder the import@@ ing images to be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you can person@@ alize the category persons on the imported file ( if you are a sw@@ ans ) , while this category is called for your database persons . therefore , you are asked in the third dialogue window , which categories will be imported to the imported file , and which categories are those in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can select the categories of the imported file with the categories of your current database . an example of this is shown on the picture . &quot;
&quot; it has to be easy to browse pictures and view : if you look at images , you often want to watch images from different picture groups &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; if you want to view images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will undergo the various steps from the ( 1 ) feast of the information about your images , over ( 2 ) the per@@ missions and prestige , to pass through to ( 3 ) advanced topics and adap@@ tability . &quot;
&quot; the Photo@@ album has been started as a program for the administrator of your images . however , it has been expanded and today you will also take care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but frequently this also includes video . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; stores all of its information in the file inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml in the top folder of their images . it is a simple XML file that you can secure with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal security tools , copy to a disk or revisions in CV@@ S , where they want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; remembers the folder in which your pictures are stored and used it in future start automatically . if you want to read another folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with images , you can start &amp; on photo@@ album . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / picture / inde@@ x.@@ x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; using the menu entry settings on photo@@ album , set up ... you can get to a window by which you can change the settings of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album . in the following section of the user guide you will explain the different settings options . &quot;
&quot; here you can see six different symbols , with which you can view the installation possibilities and options for the viewer . for each setting a detailed help is available , you can access the F1 button and a click on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; in it was described how you can set various properties , e.g. persons , places and tags . you can also create your own groups such as items , animals or albums . &quot;
&quot; on the dialogue , which is used to process already existing groups . for each existing group , you can select a cap@@ tion and a symbol . &quot;
&quot; in the section sub@@ categories have already been mentioned . in dialogue options you can set up complete membership groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group will count on once in a group rather than explained all groups of a member . &quot;
&quot; in view the settings options available to you for the celebration of the members . with the above arranged selection list , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left window there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub@@ categories . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; shares his module with other graphics applications , such as checking and G@@ wen@@ view . this module is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; de ; Image Plugin Interface . nutritional information interface can be found on the homepage of Ki@@ pi . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed through the menu modules . the modules can and are not described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page , which you can call over the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules can be shared among each other among each other , it may be that the modules were using &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; this is why you can always test new modules first with the demo database , before you call it on your own images using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album / demo &lt; / input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . say not , I would not have been fore@@ warned ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules using K@@ IP@@ I jointly , are very different , whereby it can be that some modules with &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album is not working . this is the downside if you share features with various applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album , and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications are not supported in albums : this kind of order does not support , simul@@ ates it for some modules the order to albums , so that you can use the functions with &amp; cold album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , so all images that show you the picture @-@ show at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album has to be ready &amp; on photo@@ album ; the modules also got a list of albums . here goes on photo@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will be the category that you have specified in the settings as category for virtual albums . so if you want to use the category persons , so if you had selected persons to view and pass this on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album is not compatible with you , you can remove them from the list of modules . start setting up dialog and select in the module module , which modules are to be loaded . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see an example of an image screen , as soon as you start &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album with your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; as you are used to use it from any other K@@ DE application , take a look at the above menu and tool@@ bar . at the moment , it does not contain very many information , as you still have no information about your images entered . in the section we will see this window , but now click on the entry images that shows you an overview with all existing images . &quot;
one of the main functions of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album is the possibility to see any picture with notes . this includes information about the people who are listed on the picture . you can write every image either individually or for a larger number of pictures given specific notes at the same time . if for example on all pictures Jes@@ per is pic@@ tured and all pictures in Copenhagen were taken .
&quot; all these notes may be used for seeking and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want to see these notes , if you use the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by selecting individuals , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album , as you can use it again and again when you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to reloc@@ ating the pictures within the list : if you have illustrated a family party , and you can view the same 5 @-@ 10 persons on all 50 pictures , so that the used names are moved upwards to locate the persons more quickly and to classi@@ fy them . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to get an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sor@@ ting on date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected any comments on each image individually , you might want to edit all selected images and add these pictures with notes . just click on the pictures and back buttons , which are displayed on the right corner of the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to highlight all these images and add the menu item Multi @-@ item on a once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . furthermore , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the picture you see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ group . to show you that it is a group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the context menu of the dialog menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ categories or sub@@ category . in addition , you can also take an entry to a category and disc@@ ard it to make this a sub@@ category to sort this entry . attention , this requires you to sort straight your categories alphabe@@ tically . see that . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the an@@ alogue by moving the le@@ track , which form the edge of the frame , click and post@@ p@@ one . you can also make your own window by moving it outside the window . &quot;
&quot; when you have adapted the look of the window so to your needs , you are satisfied with the settings , click on the button options ... that offers you the opportunity to save the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also release a frame fully . if you want to see this window later again , use the button options ... and then click the window into the picture . you will see this step in the picture . &quot;
&quot; when you select the entry images in the browser , you will receive an overview with thumb@@ images of currently selected images , or all pictures in case you have no filter . one example here . you can configure the size of the thumb@@ nails , by simply down the mouse with the middle mouse button , configure . try it easy . &quot;
&quot; when you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on an image , this picture is displayed in the picture . if you have not yet opened a window with a picture view , a new ad window will be created . &quot;
&quot; you can also delete pictures from the pic@@ torial button . simply select the appropriate pictures from you , and select either the Dele@@ te button or select in the Edit menu . now you can see the window that you can see in the picture . &quot;
&quot; photo@@ photo@@ album ; for this problem you can use a solution . you can also have saved the pictures anywhere , so you can record the pictures somewhere in the database . in the picture you can see the view of &amp; on photo@@ album ; if not all necessary pictures can be loaded from your hard drive . &quot;
&quot; pictures , where the right upper left is cut off , are not stored on the hard disk . however , for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so you can view the thumb@@ nails of these images . however , you can also view these pictures with the image . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , you need this feature that you can copy files from the folders and get back to you . so if you do not want to avoid the inser@@ tion of the corresponding CD . if you want to avoid trouble , like the mess of your pictures , please buy a larger hard drive to save all the images . &quot;
&quot; in the menu images you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name of privacy . if you want to stay a little more privacy , you filter the pictures that you may want to see for other in@@ accessible and click Cur@@ rent View in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also lock all images that may see your little sister , con@@ ta@@ vers and menu entry in all except current view . &quot;
&quot; to set out what images are to be kept hidden in case of the case . if you give the laptop now your little sister , simply select the menu entry images , thereby adding all the images that you have locked . if you want to get the pictures again , click Sper@@ re . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that needs to be entered . to set up this password , simply select a password in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; keep in mind that this picture protection is under no circumstances very safe . on the one hand , all images on the hard disk and on the other can delete or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this type of password protection is used only to those who are familiar with &amp; cold album . not very familiar to rep@@ el the view of private pictures . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you can manage all of your pictures with &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album ; manage and run hours over hours of course , that you want to look at it sometime . for this reason , &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewed . you can start from the preview , as described in the preview . &quot;
&quot; the viewer you can see in . he of course shows the picture , but additional all the information you have to enter about the picture , e.g. who is in the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info box on the upper part of the picture you want to see , so you can easily drag it with the mouse and disc@@ ard it somewhere . you can also configure which information is displayed and if any information is displayed on the viewer . all these options are available after a right @-@ click on the viewer . you can see the appearing context menu . &quot;
&quot; some words in the Info@@ box are underlined . if you click here , the browser , see , matching entries for this display . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser shows you all pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected persons from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple pictures in the observer , you can switch between them and go back , using the buttons image to use high and image . you can jump to the first and last image with tro@@ 1 and end . these functions are also accessible from the context menu . &quot;
if multiple images are loaded in the observer you can run it as di@@ ash@@ au . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; loads a new image after a couple of seconds . how often it loads a new image by pressing the Str@@ g button and Plus or minus . start and stopped by the th@@ asch@@ au by the keys C@@ tr@@ l ; S .
a very useful ability of the be@@ holder of &amp; ri@@ photo@@ album is to be able to switch it into the screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete seat on the screen . simply use the input key to change the screen mode and back .
when you use the viewer you can get in the picture and turn out zo@@ oming . on the pull @-@ ray you can simply drag a rect@@ angle . with the minus button you can re @-@ turn r@@ out The Plus button zo@@ om@@ t in the middle of the picture . shows how a zoom @-@ rect@@ angle is marked and shows the result of the zoom .
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the picture is not drawn as zo@@ omed . with the in@@ fertile places the zo@@ oms , so that every pixel is on the screen a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations function in videos , that in the start and turn out zo@@ oming with the Plus@@ - and search@@ engine . &quot;
&quot; with the speed functions from the context menu , you can turn the picture . this does not work with videos . you can make notes to the current image with the menu item note from the context menu . &quot;
if you look at pictures it can happen that you can find an image with a person whose name you have forgotten on the picture . in the moment you can view the read@@ ab@@ ort and configur@@ able dialog of the picture to add this name . but you may prefer to highlight the picture and see more pictures .
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to see which photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark it as good or bad while you look at one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add pictures with features while watching them . characteristics are the letters A to Z , and you can press a characteristic by putting the corresponding letters . in view , you can see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have set the features placed on your pictures , they are available in the browser to see . so if you have all the pictures that you edit , print or whatever chosen , so you can use a module to copy the selected images on a CD or whatever you want . &quot;
categories and special features can be displayed in the thumb@@ view . if you view categories in your thumb@@ view . if you select categories on the pictures by simply pressing the letters for the character after the picture was selected . this can be seen here :
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allow you &amp; cold album ; on the picture to paint .
the mixture is not saved with the image but in the database . on the way you can und@@ o your painted later .
&quot; in turn , you can see an image on the painted picture . to switch on the painting from the context menu . to end the painting , simply press the cross in tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you have to master the application of the program &amp; Pov@@ ray ; not completely master@@ ed , but the documentation about &amp; Pov@@ ray . should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , you can select single objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties tab and displayed the object in the wire modes . &quot;
&quot; you can also select multiple objects simultaneously . but not the object of an already selected object , since all sub@@ missions are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position where you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the menu item . &quot;
&quot; there are multi @-@ possible positions , the following is built @-@ in , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can previously remove selected objects from the scene . &quot;
&quot; when you have changed properties , click apply to apply these changes . have you entered invali@@ d values , a message appears with a error description . then you can apply the input error and re @-@ apply it , or change the changes with Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; when you enter the path to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation in the furnishing dialog , you can call the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object to access . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.5 includes the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can preview a preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ View . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ &apos; view and a small example of the scene will have chosen with the chosen texture , even if you want to have a sub@@ ordered item ( for example a texture within a texture and not the entire texture map ) , crossing locally . &quot;
the scre@@ enshot shows the check@@ points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points to the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points and there will be a small cross in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift through drag with the mouse over the whole window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a level of views as a wire model . you can indicate this value relative to the visibility of the higher object , or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when they are selected or their views of visibility , smaller or equal in the tool@@ bar selected by the scene of the scene . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; has a window array as default . the object tree and view of the properties tab are displayed on the left and the four graphical views right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window of window or if you need a different order , you can adjust it as you like . you can also save several window orders and simply switch between different formations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or under a present view , drag the beg@@ inner to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the beg@@ inner to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored on the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange several views over each other , pull the beginning water in the middle of another view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the card scene in views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window @-@ order are Swedish views . views that are not anchored in the main window . to view a view from the anch@@ oring , pull the beg@@ inner on the desktop or click the small arrow on the left side of the picture bar . &quot;
&quot; to view a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent the closing , click the small square between arrow and cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the menu view , you find entries for each type of views . new views are ho@@ vering , you can anchor them to any place . &quot;
&quot; the current window view can be saved with view window arrangement ... save . it will display a dialog , in which you can save the shut@@ down under an existing or new name . &quot;
&quot; if you created a scene , you can ren@@ ders it . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; used &amp; Pov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for ren@@ ders , this program has to be properly installed . as this manual is written in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; version 1.0 does not support . &quot;
&quot; to ren@@ oun@@ ce the current scene , click on the icon ren@@ ders the icon ren@@ ders in the tool@@ bar or select the menu entry view . &quot;
&quot; an entry mode corresponds to the entries in &amp; Pov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the size and quality of the rendering . if you want to insert a scene in various image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full pictures of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the icon The R@@ ender settings in tool@@ bar , or in View R@@ ender modes ... choose , the following dialog is opened : &quot;
&quot; each R@@ ender mode has a name . you can type any name , but makes a name , which can recognize the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the card size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you just want to add a small area of the picture , select the section section and give the excerpt of the image into the input fields . &quot;
&quot; in the combination field quality , you can select the characteristics which uses &amp; Pov@@ ray ; to ren@@ ders . this goes from a very simple color and lighting model to a model with complex diff@@ user Refle@@ ction . a detailed description of the R@@ ender properties can be found in the user manual for &amp; Pov@@ ray . &quot;
&quot; when a picture is saved with only one beam per pixel , there can be different bugs . these images often have a fashion shape or mar@@ vel effect in curves and lines , in addition sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; Pov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to decrease the influence of these errors . generally speaking pictures with this feature are better .
&quot; when you switch anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calculated and connects &amp; Pov@@ ray ; more than a beam per pixel . this technique is called super sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Pov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super sampling . as standard is an adap@@ tive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly re@@ distributed and adap@@ tive because every pixel is constantly re@@ group@@ ed and adap@@ tive because the recur@@ sively depth of calculated color values depend . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray provides a Stra@@ hl per pixel . if you set the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels , then both pixels are calculated by pursuing a certain additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the Tie@@ to value on 4 , a grid of 4x@@ 4 additional points will be calculated at a depth of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels will be considered : R 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . the difference is then : &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre @-@ defined threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub@@ directories that can be pursued individually and to further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of recur@@ sion can be set with the lowering . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the asing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the beam process , called J@@ it@@ tering . when you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; Pov@@ ray ; the bla@@ sting to avoid a tiny amount , to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
&quot; the last setting for quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental feature of &amp; Pov@@ ray ; it uses diff@@ use light@@ flexi@@ on . it takes very long to calculate one scene with this property . &quot;
on this card map you can adjust whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the associated beams have not made an object .
&quot; opens a new window to display the &amp; Pov@@ ray edition . if &amp; Pov@@ ray is finished ; un@@ expect@@ edly , you can find the reason here . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; Pov@@ ray scene , select the menu entry file import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; not yet the complete commands from &amp; Pov@@ ray ; if , when inser@@ ting error messages or warnings occur , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; please write this source code between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the code text for &amp; Pov@@ ray . this adds to the source code of the object to the opened text file in the editor , just tick the code text in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copying and inser@@ ting in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; Pov@@ ray .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; a scene does . usually this is Pov@@ ray or x @-@ Pov@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on the Help in Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; user documentation for the displayed object . place the path to your document tion and the version . support the versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; searches for external files ( for example high elev@@ ates ) in the paths to the &amp; Pov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files . if a file occurs in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for viewing the selected objects .
the color for the check@@ points . the second color is used for viewing the selected check@@ points .
the colour of the rect@@ angle for the field of view in the camera view and in the window @-@ type characteristic .
&quot; you can set the object @-@ catch of the points to the R@@ aster in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the R@@ aster separately for reloc@@ ations , sc@@ aling and screen@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; larger values give a closer wire model , and thus a better stit@@ ching for the displayed objects , but require more time for ren@@ ders . for some objects like e.g. the ball you can adjust the detail stage for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross the High detailed specifications for extended proj@@ ections , all the wire model views are further divided if the camera uses an extended projection . advanced proj@@ ections are all proj@@ ections with exceptions to the perspective and ben@@ ding proj@@ ections . this property results in a better approach to proj@@ ections , but requires more time to ren@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you cross a wall , a wall is taken behind the objects . the wall is represented in a ch@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tap the soil , a soil below the objects will be scr@@ apped . the soil is represented in a ch@@ board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you activate cant@@ ata , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method for ren@@ ders of the scenes is used . the values for depth and swelling can be set . more exact details on the parameters can be found in paragraph R@@ ender modes . &quot;
&quot; on this page you can change existing window formations , or create new window orders . in the section window of window , it is explained how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the Com@@ bin@@ ing standard window command : displays all existing window @-@ orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; uses the chosen template structure at the start of the program .
&quot; the list of available window orders shows all existing window @-@ orders . a new arrangement , you can create and delete a selected order using the button Dele@@ te button . &quot;
every shut@@ down is identified by the name . the name must be clear and must not be empty .
the list under the name displays all views of the chosen window arrangement . new views can be created with the button Add and delete selected views on the button .
&quot; the position of the new window . with new column , you will create a new column on the right hand side of the existing window , with un@@ loaded windows , you get a card view together with the previous view and ho@@ vering anchored the view not in the main window , but creates a comfor@@ ted window . &quot;
&quot; so you just have &amp; Pov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; installed and now you would like to follow all steps in this guide . if you can follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , under beginners , very popular : a sphere at a level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully note the following warnings , before you compl@@ aining that you as a result will only get a black screen . if you use a 3D program for first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set any camera , no rules can be applied to the rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; when you insert no light sources , your entire scene lies in the dark and you only get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you have everything faul@@ t@@ lessly installed , take a look at the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; the following window arrangement : &quot;
&quot; take a little time to get to know the menus and the available symbols of the tool@@ bar . read the documentation , so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you expect from this program . &quot;
&quot; you &apos;ll have to use these menus and symbols now frequently , so you should remember the menus and symbols and also their applications . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the menu entry . thus , you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene which you generate . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the scene of scene from the point of view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the content of the view Properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user &apos;s documentation to &amp; Pov@@ ray ; please find more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is later reserved , but take note that the camera in the view control has to change with which you can change the target point of the camera . simply click on a check@@ point and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; when you apply the button or the input taste , the wire @-@ views and the object tree change immediately according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the perspective of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the bottom for the scene . you could insert a cu@@ ader ( inser@@ ting body he@@ aders ) and the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a non@@ profit method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; in fact offers an easier option . you can use an infinite level as a ground :
&quot; a good advice : choose the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the button . in the object tree the new name will be shown immediately . &quot;
&quot; the wire view now also displays the level , even though at the moment only as a limited end@@ setting plane . if you change the scene , the level stretches up to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you view the object tree accurately , you will find that you can click the item for the ground when you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will find the different parameters for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shift . select one of these options , also change the possible settings in the view of the item properties . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the ground to exercise a unit among the horizon line , only to get to know some of these parameters . select shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to stop its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose a bit at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases a dialog opens , in which you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select the name in the object tree ( name = floor @-@ pig@@ ment ) , with a click on the button preview how the pig@@ ment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the preview of the pig@@ ment is only a matt black material , because you can have settings for the pig@@ ment yet . therefore always remember that you can check the appearance of materials at any time with a click on preview . now , enter the colors for the pig@@ ment . there are also many possibilities for this , but now take the easiest . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on qu@@ ader and ball in the preview , then click on the button and then call the preview . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now correct . if you get your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; of course , this is not the color that you have expected . here are some more settings necessary . in the color listing , you need to enter two new attributes , called color listing . then edit this entry twice ( you can also do this more frequently , but the chess @-@ board color can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; choose in the object @-@ tree every time , and change the colors in the view of the properties tab : &quot;
&quot; this step should you already run out , as you should have understood the basic working methods of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; you should have understood the ball as easy as the ground : &quot;
&quot; in the view of the properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( do not forget the input button or the button . otherwise , the sphere would float above the ground as you have pushed the ground down a unit down . &quot;
&quot; of course , the rendering now results in a strange result : as previously seen , the ball @-@ surface appears like a flames @-@ black material . put in the following step a suitable material . &quot;
&quot; when you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material now . as already on the ground , you enter the ball a pig@@ ment as a colour : &quot;
&quot; select First and change the name for example in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on ball pig@@ ment , select then one @-@ color and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can reach interesting effects if you take the time to adjust some finish properties : &quot;
then change the values as in the following screen photos and click on the input button .
&quot; the settings on gl@@ oss and reflection already arise partly good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces even if metallic : still not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good idea of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; hopefully , you have already learned so much that you can easily , but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ tracing is a rating method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; when you find a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ en , sho@@ ots the ren@@ derer hyp@@ othe@@ tical beams from the perspective of the be@@ holder ( i.e. from the camera that impact the scenes ) by each pixel in the scene and as atmospheric effects such as fog . thus , the scene pixels by pixels are processed . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you &apos;ll see nothing without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene need to be saved , some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . Pov@@ ray files usually have file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; opens a file . in standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have previously equipped with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted in this sub@@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already stored the model , it is stored under the same name . it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a storage space . &quot;
&quot; represents the scene again in the last recorded version . all changes since the last storage process has been rejected . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry , you can only select if you do not have stored changes in the scene . &quot;
&quot; repeat the last und@@ one command . this menu entry , you can only select if you have used editing . &quot;
&quot; saves the current size of the window and opens a dialog , in which you enter a name for a new order or re@@ write an existing order . &quot;
&quot; in this menu you will find options for the hi@@ ring of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; here , you can change the look , the short@@ cut and the default . &quot;
opens a dialog to modify the keyboard short@@ cut . you can change or add new commands using this option .
opens up a dialog to set up the tool@@ ing tool . you can add and remove orders with this option tool@@ ing for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ mod@@ eler ; commands and remove .
a B@@ ump map is a way to spr@@ ink@@ le consuming surfaces without need to model virtually every b@@ ump on the surface and without change the geom@@ etrical form of the object .
&quot; it is common to use the same file for a B@@ ump map as well as for a texture map . &quot;
&quot; basic bodies are simple geom@@ etric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are created from dozens , or even hundreds of this basic body . these models will then continue to be edited so as to give them a realistic look . &quot;
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color on pixel basis , using a picture file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; is a comfortable picture @-@ looking and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full @-@ screen mode .
&quot; the use of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show is very simple . the file browser lists files , which you can return with clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return . &quot;
you can adjust whether any image should be displayed in a separate window or whether all images are always to use the same window .
&quot; if you are looking for a specific file , just type the first character of the file in the browser window . then a small input field is found in the right corner . if a password file was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing return or &amp; ess@@ c . &quot;
&quot; set up in dialogue - &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the operation of &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; set in the two others , short commands for display and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if this is selected , then the pictures will be opened in full screen mode . if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the ad surface is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; already the next picture in the folder , while you can still see the current picture . this reduces the delay in case you choose the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
with this option saves &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; when entering the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opens &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored beams to select a background color . this is used in to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is bigger than the picture , the background is also filled with the selected colour . &quot;
&quot; you can set &amp; ku@@ i@@ ck@@ show , so set up that only some of the file types may be displayed , which can also be displayed as the program . &quot;

&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; D ; photo editing based on the &amp; checking came ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; publication ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a quick picture editing with some powerful tools tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means that the user contributes to his part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo , makes it as easy as possible to report bugs or possible improvements . wherever you are in the program , the menu provides a link to reports of problems and wishes . all required information is already filled out , and you can simply follow the instructions to specify your message . &quot;
&quot; a show@@ photo , is a project which is supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , we would like to answer questions of other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , in this mail@@ ing@@ list , English speaking , you should be powerful to this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to get involved in a show@@ photo , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developers mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; &quot;
&quot; a show@@ photo , try to give you so much control of its work@@ flow as possible . there are many options that change the behavior of &amp; show@@ photo . to access these settings , you need to change the menu settings below . you can switch between these settings by pressing on the symbols of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the area of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure inde@@ xed should display the colors with what you are to display , in contrast should display a bright color and over@@ exposure to dark color . &quot;
the main window of &amp; show@@ photo ; has a side@@ bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions to the selected images . the same side@@ bar you can also find in picture editing . you can view this in which you click on one of the five rider :
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is an application for scanning images that no longer makes images scan and help .
&amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan images that do not make more than images to scan and retrieve . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; can store the images automatically in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format .
you can check the status of supporting your scanner on the SA@@ NE project page by typ@@ ing the necessary information on this search page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ o@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set on the command line from &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite , using the command sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in terminal . if this scanner is not opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog to choose the scanner is open . &quot;
the user can select the scanner and click OK to open the scanner . exit off &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; stop .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; ( li@@ b@@ ks@@ ane ) deals with these options not particularly .
&quot; to log in to a picture , the user can only launch a preview and then choose scanning area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the Pre@@ view button . &quot;
&quot; to select the picture better , the user can enter the image into the image and out of the current selection out zo@@ oming . he can also adjust the zoom so that the complete thumb@@ nails will fit into the window . &quot;
when the picture was selected then the final image can be read with the scan button .
&quot; if before saving a preview display in the settings , then the image is displayed in a preview window , as shown below , then the image will be saved and scar@@ ed ? will lead to a break and you get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; with the kno@@ b settings , the same @-@ name dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the picture if desired , before saving . in this case the option has to be selected before saving a preview . if this thumb@@ nails will not be desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type as &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; images store for storing for each image open the dialog in front of each image saved . if &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; these are automatically saved with a generated name in a specified folder , then you need to ask for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the option saving without using a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , this folder will be used as default for dialog for saving . the default value is your home directory , and you can change it with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter is defined a picture fix for the automatically mem@@ orized images , and is beyond the suggested name for the image in dialog to store . the automatically stored picture gets top of the numer@@ ical view@@ ix of each time , if an image is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality to save time . this value also changes the compression value in store . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button help starts the K@@ DE @-@ Help with the &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; -@@ manual . the button About will start the K@@ DE About -@@ Dialogue for &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite ; the button settings shows the dialog for settings and Connect can be used to end &amp; sk@@ an@@ l@@ ite .

&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; used like all other programs ke@@ ystro@@ kes . below , you can set up a list of these abbrevi@@ ation and their function . the global short@@ cuts can set you up by clicking with the right mouse button in the player @-@ window and set the keyboard short@@ cut by selecting the right mouse button to the player @-@ window and select short commands ... select . &quot;
you may possibly set up existing multimedia keys that they function as &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Short @-@ command function . this makes you make your keyboard about &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; control centre .
&quot; the D@@ COP @-@ Interface of Am@@ aro@@ k has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is supposed to describe the D@@ COP functionality of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists and scripts . such as : &quot;
Am@@ aro@@ k supports the command @-@ lines of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; in addition Am@@ aro@@ k has some own command @-@ lines options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script is not executed due to a missing addiction . please check in your script , if all required modules are present and use k@@ dialog , so the user notices why a script does not go . &quot;
B@@ EG@@ IN require &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Er@@ ror error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE Bin@@ dings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ de@@ binding v@@ 3.4 is and for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
in the folder scripts / templates you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively easy .
&quot; with the help of D@@ COP , your scripts can be exchanged with Am@@ aro@@ k and Am@@ aro@@ k . the easiest way is using the command d@@ co@@ p ; that each CT installation should be attached . &quot;
&quot; most scrip@@ ting languages are possible to execute external programs and commands . in this way , d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively simple . here is an example in Python : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this , Str@@ ings should constantly monitor their default values and react according to events . of course , a script can also ignore events if there is no use of it . &quot;
configure We@@ is the script to display the furnishings dialog . to store and store the furniture data each script should take care of each script . if a script is started , Am@@ aro@@ k sets the job folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tr@@ ack@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script might now be &amp; eg . with D@@ COP features more information about the new piece ( for example the met@@ adata or the length ) .
volume : change new@@ volume signal a change of volume . the new volume is an integer between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ able Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu @-@ Tit@@ le . be@@ aten the path to the selected files in the playlist if a user @-@ defined menu entry is clicked . to remove an entry again it is d@@ co@@ p Am@@ aro@@ k script remo@@ ve@@ able It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; the signal S@@ IG@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed , for example setting up data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ ks script administration can also install script packages which can download the user &amp; eg . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can be optional also with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ b@@ z@@ 2 ) , so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as an am@@ aro@@ k script . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the Exten@@ sive amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason you should name your script packages equally .
&quot; the main script should be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining to load@@ able modules should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file name : &quot;
if your script is ready to load it on www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Am@@ aro@@ k ; scripts .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; you can simply drag the music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menu items . maybe you are looking for a very particular title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &apos;s collecting browser and the quick search you will find the piece within seconds .
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which you want to hear ? then the playlist browser is just right for you . and if you choose the choice is still hard , select the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers IF@@ P and many generic USB devices . furthermore , many different audio systems can be used so you can learn how to listen to your music . Am@@ aro@@ k is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right to experience your music anew ! &quot;
&quot; usually , one has to enter in the basic folder of the Am@@ aro@@ k sources to compile and install Am@@ aro@@ K : &quot;
&quot; since &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; auto@@ conf@@ use and autom@@ agi@@ ake , you should have no difficulties when comp@@ iling any difficulties . if you encounter problems , please report it into the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; has as most applications , some options that can enable or disable the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the comp@@ iling options , certain dependen@@ cies must be satisfied so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements . &quot;
&quot; activated de@@ bu@@ gging icons . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help in the development of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; you should be full . &quot;
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can be set up without effort over the furnishing dialog . the furnishings dialog has multiple card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ;
&quot; player window displays the player window in addition to the playlist . if the option is switched off , only the play@@ lists will be displayed in the window ) . &quot;
voting bar@@ ometer use : this function is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . the option cuts the experimental function of the mood bar@@ ometer .
design @-@ filled design : this function is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . thus the used color scheme for the voting bar@@ ometer is altered .
&quot; tuning files in the music files : this feature is only available when &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar , compiled . otherwise , the .@@ c. files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Am@@ aro@@ k / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k will be started when a browser is needed .
&quot; use other browsers : here you can specify the path to a different browser , which is not in the list above . &quot;
playlist when you save it stores the current playlist automatically when entering &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the current playlist upon completion .
&quot; relative paths for manually stored playlist : if you activate this setting , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; current piece in the re@@ ap visible , that the playlist windows open @-@ up / rolls to keep the current piece always visible in the visible window area . &quot;
switching to the context @-@ browser displays automatically the context browser as soon as the next piece is played .
&quot; in the section , you can customize &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s appearance , the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in fonts section you can use the use of various fonts in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; by selecting own writings , the otherwise grey section will be activated . you can select fonts for the following section : playlist windows , player windows and context browser . click Out@@ put ... , so you can choose a desired font from the selection dialog . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of the defined color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the included color pi@@ ped for front and background color . &quot;
&quot; play on the start of the start , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; after the start of the start the reproduction is automatically continued with the piece on the spot , with which it has been stopped at the end . &quot;
&quot; the Sub@@ window On @-@ screen display allows you to switch the OS@@ D . if on @-@ screen display is clicked , a preview of the OS@@ D is displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview . &quot;
&quot; the first option is the font . click on select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the OS@@ D . the tick @-@ box shadow causes , that the text is sh@@ aded in the OS@@ D . &quot;
&quot; use your own colors will give you the possibility to adjust the OS@@ D colors for font and background . one click on the color patch opens the dialog to color selection . if original colors are not activated , the pre @-@ featured &amp; k@@ de ; colors are used . &quot;
the display text display text displays the text shown in the OS@@ D . by typ@@ ing places can be adapted to the OS@@ D . below you will find a list of available Plac@@ eholder and what they mean .
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama @-@ users , so you can specify , on which screen a multi @-@ screen saver to appear the OS@@ D . &quot;
the card @-@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the selection box . some drivers enable even more options in this box .
the card @-@ card collection is used for setting up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; search for music files . to include a folder into the collection , select the tick @-@ box next to its name . this section also contains An@@ cross@@ roads to set up , as should be used with the selected folders . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ folders browse : this causes , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; both the crossed and their sub@@ folder to search for music . &quot;
changes : allows &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to monitor the selected folder on changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) . furthermore an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection .
&quot; play@@ lists import : causes , that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; all found play@@ lists in your collection folders ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) added to your collection , then they appear later in the play@@ lists . &quot;
the part of the payment database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination box driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ ql . if My@@ S@@ ql is selected is another device in the sub@@ window My@@ S@@ ql set up .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ ql institution is used to set up the database for &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; it is used under control : the network is entered in which the My@@ S@@ ql database is entered . after that , the database name is entered under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name , to which the connection is made . &quot;
use user name : and password : to enter the data required for connection to the database .
the card @-@ card free@@ .@@ f@@ m depends on the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ server and create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; please enter your username and password for your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you have no profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m Web site . &quot;
&quot; send pieces and so update the profile : this option makes it possible &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; to transfer the names of the played songs to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . &quot;
similar interpre@@ ters : after activation of this attitude will call &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; a list with similar interpre@@ ters to the each played play . note : you can use the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this feature .
&amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; is an audio @-@ player for Unix systems ( like &amp; eg ; Linux ) . further information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen photos .
&quot; Am@@ aro@@ k only needs the K@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no further K@@ DE Pack@@ ages . you have to install K@@ deli@@ bs ( including the included programs , because &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; do some of them , for example modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide , how to compile K@@ deli@@ bs minimal . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the OS@@ D set in advance that your window manager will stop the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ ES@@ top@@ .org . however , Gn@@ ome is going to work for example , we are trying to support Am@@ aro@@ k on all platforms , so we use K@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they are providing an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ Li@@ b library . you can read the file by clicking the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the cap@@ ut@@ te file which causes the cras@@ hing down . then you can delete the file and create the collection again .
mostly this is because Tag@@ lib cras@@ hes when reading the met@@ a @-@ information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ Li@@ b developer under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . the support for this in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k is a bit mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version have been compiled . if , for example , &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; with GCC 3.4 , Tag@@ Li@@ b , but with GCC 3.@@ 3.@@ x compiled , then results in editing the met@@ a @-@ information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE using art@@ s@@ d , then disable them . turn off if in@@ active for ... in the setting of the sound system , or use at least no value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace via e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail is automatically opening up with a crash ) . if it is a commonly used cras@@ hing , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many program data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 can write in the met@@ a @-@ information , but not as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
# ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; The file $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b@@ - &gt; new ( $ arg@@ v &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ MP@@ 3@@ - &gt; set _ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script requires the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib . it can be installed with this command : Perl -@@ M@@ C@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos;@@ install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ lib &apos;
&quot; &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; s symbols in the stat@@ us@@ bar ( random mode / repetition / dynam@@ ical playlist ) see in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , you can see the status de@@ activated on grey and half @-@ transparent . note that in some cases you have to click on a symbol until this setting shows its effect . &quot;
if you get this mistake : amar@@ ok@@ app : amar@@ ok@@ app : und@@ oc@@ app : und@@ oc@@ app : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Sc@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pixel map then please check if Am@@ aro@@ k uses the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen using ld@@ d &apos;@@ n amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BAR _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf to adjust that Am@@ aro@@ k will find the right version first . &quot;
&quot; there are several possibilities . most of the installation problems arise at the easiest way by using a experts to search your Uni@@ x@@ - or Linux distribution . you can also use the forum and IR@@ C under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Am@@ aro@@ k . &quot;
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for help . please enter here only a bug when you get something at the re@@ fraction of an error in Am@@ aro@@ k itself .
after the start of &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; appears only a blank playlist . how do music come up there ?
&quot; that &apos;s easy . use the file browser to the left and open the folder , then drag the files to the right part of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; to keep the surface user intui@@ tively , the start -@@ sub@@ window has been converted to the statisti@@ c window . you will find it under ex@@ tras statistics . &quot;
the importance of these symbols has changed with Am@@ aro@@ k 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for the evaluation by the user while the points are automatically calculated .
to evaluate pieces must be indicated in the playlist of the playlist . click on the title bar of the playlist and select column . click anywhere in the new application column to set the rating for a piece . you can also use the short command @-@ command Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Am@@ aro@@ k is in the background .
&quot; select the files you want to remove , and then press En@@ f on your keyboard . or click with right mouse button on your selection and select from playlist off from the drop @-@ up menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist , and let it fall there , just like you &apos;d like to make it with other files too . so simple is that : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar of the playlist , right next to the add button , you can store the button playlist . click on it . &quot;
probably missing the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install the package x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel and install &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; new . look even after li@@ b@@ ye to this package contains many very nice visu@@ alizations .
&quot; the equ@@ ali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you will find it about the menu bar under ex@@ tras . &quot;
&quot; no . yes , that is true ! not ! &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , hence the real question is to support G@@ asp@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support this pretty much every single audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! maybe you use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which default no MP3 de@@ coder can be supplied ( for pat@@ ent@@ legal reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , g@@ g : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; Play MP3 &apos;s off : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ exten@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa S@@ ink , the device must use a mix@@ er . a bl@@ ender allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously audio ( software mix@@ er ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( e.g. SB@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for Al@@ sa . take a look at the help of the mix for Al@@ sa . &quot;
&quot; the issue of this command should help you find the problem of the problem and help you find a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different sink ( e.g. os@@ s@@ wap ) . &quot;
&quot; this is doing &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; already do not forget that media have to be de@@ co@@ ded . you can only hear a white smoke . G@@ Stre@@ amer is reading the file , de@@ code it and sends the PC@@ M data to Al@@ sa . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS de@@ code the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to Al@@ sa , just as x@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; use the G@@ exten@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open control center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable Sound@@ server operated with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound fan ( warning , see next point of the FAQ section ! ) . make sure that art@@ s@@ wr@@ apper SU@@ ID is set : &quot;
at K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ dec@@ s that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this bug report . enlarge the sound card in your Al@@ sa furniture file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; do not use the Arts drivers , but instead G@@ quar@@ amer or x@@ ins , or install K@@ DE @-@ Multimedia complete to get the fastest Arts co@@ dec@@ s ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ m@@ pe@@ gli@@ .@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; probably you use the Arts driver . use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or reduce the size of the Arts Pu@@ ffer in the control center and Sound &amp; Multimedia , Sound System . the smaller the bu@@ ffer , the less than the visu@@ alizations . yes , this is an error , please help us fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ it@@ amer is installed , but when I want to change to the glam@@ orous driver , cras@@ hes &amp; Am@@ aro@@ K ; AB ? why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you have to register all the components . run G@@ ST register to register all the G@@ it@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that does not help , you can also ask the IR@@ C @-@ channel # g@@ stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Am@@ aro@@ k before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg downloaded , compile and install it . then delete G@@ ST @-@ register with G@@ ST @-@ config / g@@ stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run G@@ ST @-@ register again . start now &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; &quot;

&quot; this command lets &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k runs before you go to bed , then you are wo@@ ken out of the gentle kill@@ ings of music that you have stopped in front of bed . &quot;
how to find out the current in &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; ongoing tracks when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment exists , you can proceed as follows . this instruction gives you interpre@@ ter and title of the current piece : ssh -@@ i ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ user name Am@@ aro@@ k Players now@@ Play@@ ing &quot;
replace IP @-@ address with your IP and your username . this requires your identification in the file ~ / .@@ ssh / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; the visu@@ alis@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Am@@ aro@@ k ; -@@ Win@@ dow , press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent , in the size of modi@@ fiable window . &quot;
the combination of str@@ g + rights mouse button puts a piece in the click track in queue . by pressing the input range following a search in the playlist , the first search results will be played and the search is reset . &quot;
&quot; OK , the player &apos;s window and the playlist have tri@@ ck@@ eted functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
click with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n ; on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser are to be displayed .
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on an NFS @-@ drive . after the launch of Am@@ aro@@ k , the collection database may not be created and on the console appear many error messages . what now ? &quot;

&quot; insert the CD , then click in the menu on audio CD . it opens a file browser with multiple folders . you can download a few pieces and drag them into the desired destination folder in a con@@ voy window . for automatic enco@@ ding , take files from the folders mp3 or og@@ g . &quot;

&quot; basically , this adap@@ ts the previous valuation with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more often the play was played , the less influence has every single assessment on the overall result . &quot;
you can enter the rating for a piece by yourself by clicking with the right mouse button on a column trans@@ cription in the playlist . there you can select the evaluation of a piece like all the other attributes , namely by selecting the right mouse button to edit and edit : rating or F@@ 2 . you can edit the rating also in the dialog Met@@ adata . &quot;

&quot; if you specify a certain search engine , you can also search for larger or smaller . for example : rating : &gt; 50@@ th This is looking for mosquit@@ os that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ somewhat looks for mosquit@@ oes that do not contain something . &quot;
you can combine these syn@@ onymous variations after expos@@ ing each other . example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bathroom . this searches for all pieces that either have Mike Old@@ field , or have higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment . &quot;

c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) . on the Internet such programs are generally called ri@@ pper .
&quot; O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open , patented and professional technology for audio enco@@ ding and for handling audio data stream . O@@ GG supplies benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ g@@ g Vor@@ bis Dec@@ oder@@ - and Encoder modules . &quot;
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ audio de@@ coder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers of Lay@@ er I , Lay@@ er II , and Lay@@ er III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 de@@ coder module . &quot;
L@@ ame : a widely developed MP3 de@@ coder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . L@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ Encoder module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source code for loss of loss of audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by FLA@@ C Dec@@ oder module and the external audio @-@ Encoder module so you can read FLA@@ C files and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ m@@ peg , FLA@@ C , Muse@@ u Dec@@ oder : further libraries for the processing of different audio formats . with FF@@ m@@ peg it is possible to de@@ code WMA files to burn it to an audio CD burning .@@ de@@ co &quot;
&quot; so@@ x : an auxiliary program , which can switch between different audio formats and convert . so@@ x is used by the so@@ x audio Encoder module . &quot;
&quot; trans@@ code : a command @-@ line program for video editing . you need it , if you want to read a DVD . &quot;
V@@ CD@@ Ima@@ ger : one in the functionality of fully equipped authors system for editing , dis@@ assemb@@ ling and analy@@ zing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to fit the volume of audio files to a standard level . for example , for example , for creating the pur@@ ée CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections , this can be useful for example to create the different ur@@ ch@@ ins of different albums at the uneven effect that the music pieces can be played differently according to the effect . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ enter all videos in the basic folder of the CD .
&quot; this is a convenient way , recently opened projects re@@ charging . the associated under@@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry opens the project . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project . if the project has already been stored , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise , after a new file name . &quot;
&quot; saves the current project under a new file name . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save Target As is displayed , with which you can select folder and file name for the project file . &quot;
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you choose to store for each project file .
&quot; includes the current project . if a project is changed and not saved , ask &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; ask what is to happen . you can then break between save and change . besides , you can break the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each non @-@ stored project , which is to happen , just as if you have called for each project file . &quot;
includes all opened projects and termin@@ ates &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; . for any non @-@ stored project is asked about what is to happen so as if you have called the file .
&quot; when you access this entry , you can select the files you need to add files to add to the project . that &apos;s the same effect as if you move the files directly from the top view into the project &apos;s view . if the current project is a data CD , the added files will appear in the basic folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialogue with &quot; burning &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the characteristics of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , can only open when the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the properties dialog for the current project . here , you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of which are described above the What is that ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or video @-@ DVD project . it is useful if you want to merge files from a previous session to the current project . it is useful for you to see files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is more useful for you to see files on the medium already existing files and folders .
&quot; this entry will only appear with an active data CD / DVD or Video DVD project . this function can be removed from the current project . all other files will be stored in the project . this function does not remove files from the medium , they only bl@@ ends the previously imported files again . &quot;
&quot; open the CD copying dialog . this also allows without project file copying from a CD to another medium . alternatively , you can also only create a copy of a CD which you can then later burn . besides , there is also the possibility of K@@ lon@@ gs instead of normal cop@@ ier . you should also prefer cl@@ ones if you want to copy CDs with def@@ ective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this enables the copying file to create a DVD to another medium . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD to another medium . alternatively , there is also the possibility of a DVD with the help of copying dialogue . besides , the target medium must be large enough to be able to absorb the entire ( video ) data of the source media in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW . thus , you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to form@@ atting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which makes the content completely deleted . &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modules and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; if the dialog is burning with a * .@@ iso , * .@@ B.@@ C or * .@@ to@@ c file as data source that can then immediately be used by pushing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , therefore you have to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burns a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as data source , which can then be burned down immediately by pushing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; a previously illuminated DVD video can be converted . it helps you to read this dialog window . this dialogue window appears usually after reading a DVD on the content , but can also be used only . it contains information about the illuminated video , code settings and even options for changing the size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; shows information about the attached medium . this information is shown in the content view , including characteristics of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ making by &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . if an entry is enabled , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; when this is crossed , a small bar on the bottom of the window will display . it contains information about the status of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not enabled , the status bar is blan@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; turns the folder view one or out . the folder view contains an overview of your folder and the CD / DVD drives . if the content is activated , its content appears in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with features such as media information , locks and un@@ locking the disk or throw @-@ off of the medium . &quot;
&quot; turns the content view a or out . the table view enables to select and drag files to the project view . the view is also the interface to reading audio or video CDs , provided a drive with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; turns the copy list in the projection view or from . the copy list is a narro@@ wer area , which is only visible when the projection screen saver has no real function , it just looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the remaining views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialogue window to change the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . after having one of the available commands in the upper part , one can adapt the ke@@ ystro@@ kes for it further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the K@@ 3@@ b ; furniture assistant . thus you can set the correct permission to burning CDs and DVDs . therefore system administration rights are needed , so you need to enter the password for the system administration ( root ) at the start of the wizard . &quot;
open the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . here you can edit the settings of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b . nearly all functions of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; should work on An@@ hi@@ eb . this dialogue is to person@@ alize and maintaining the program .
&quot; &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many other &amp; k@@ de ; applications also , equipped with a &amp; D@@ COP ; interface . using this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions , you can either use the command line d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more comfortable program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality , hence it is rather your taste and type of your task . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter we assume that you can use the command line d@@ code . to use the &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ features , you must first ensure that &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; started . then enter something like the following at the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ COP ; -@@ functions that have in common , supported &amp; K@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the Standard D@@ COP interface of &amp; K@@ 3@@ b , provides functions such as copy@@ CD , form@@ at@@ DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; read a audio CD ; read , read and saved in MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG files . other formats are possible depending on the Encoder which is installed on your machine . &quot;
&amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; files in W@@ AV files on hard disk ) and from many co@@ di@@ ers that are currently enco@@ ded on ( compressed @-@ free compression ) . more co@@ di@@ ers can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) .
&quot; first , the titles of the &amp; CD will be read , and stored in W@@ AV files on your computer ( loss of loss and compressed ) ; and then &quot;
in a second step these W@@ AV files ( usually one per titles ) comp@@ resses in the MP@@ 3@@ - or O@@ GG format or other formats like the loss of lower FLA@@ C .
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost any distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , it has to be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ ie to ( for O@@ GG ) or other co@@ di@@ ers are already installed , so it is probably not necessary to compile anything ourselves . however , it is necessary to use only the co@@ ding packages that use . if for example FLA@@ C is not used , its installation is also not required . &quot;
&quot; which codi@@ fication / file format should be used ? the chapter Space Ko@@ di@@ ers gives a small introduction to co@@ ding , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy of protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the protection of audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy of the audio CD . in any case , &amp; th@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; even do not avoid the mechanisms of copying protection . avoid using the copying @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setting up only once must be made ( of furnishing dialog , but so often can be called up to a suitable configuration ) , the daily handling of the reading of a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to the understanding of the slender approach of the user interface , which you can often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which co@@ ding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; get information from the free@@ DB out of the Internet , or can work completely without a network , all of it is captured manually . &quot;
this is just a brief list of commands of the main window . on the page step by step example there are more information such as this program is used and screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the CD@@ DB request of the CD data will start with the installation of inquiry in the CD@@ DB tab . ( this can be locally or online , in the latter case it must first be connected to the Internet . ) &quot;
start reading and - if an en@@ coder is configured in the layout settings in furnishing d@@ alog - the enco@@ ding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available Encoder , allowing the selection to be read with another Encoder which can be read as the standard . it is to note that previously the Encoder has been configured in the layout settings in furnishing dialog . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already loaded file is selected for enco@@ ding rather than a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
opens the interior dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( like protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; termin@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main one @-@ turn dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different box cards ( such as en@@ coder , for setting up the en@@ code ) . here , you have to go before the program can successfully be used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , co@@ ding and compression rates and helps you in choosing the right code . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is lost , a loss of free audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other like &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; that may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly any available commercial devices that can reproduce them . &quot;
&quot; in the audio formats , MP3 and O@@ GG can lose the most common . O@@ GG does today have a slight advantage compared to MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rate ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit@@ rate the differences will be less important as both Ko@@ di@@ ers produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ not so &apos; free &apos; l@@ ame will nevertheless be supplied with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license questions . &quot;
&quot; + High to very high quality sound quality ( with high bit@@ rate rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality in deeper bit@@ rate . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from one machine or a machine based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special car stere@@ otypes . today - initially , these devices usually do not support the MP3 format . &quot;
a brief list of parameters to audio @-@ quality and the resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable and has already quite high quality . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality .
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos;@@ = 224 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps CB@@ R , compression rate about 5.5 . needs more 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for Hi@@ Fi stereo with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos;@@ = 128 k@@ bps CB@@ R common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music by young people , portable devices and car stere@@ otypes . but not good enough for better Hi@@ Fi stereo . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps CB@@ R . this option will be exagger@@ ated to most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size , then select this attitude . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information which is manually entered or fet@@ ched by the program automatically from the free@@ DB , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can pass / needed with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with code programs , there is often a combination of programs for the enco@@ ders and these parameters here . the manual or the help on the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
for example to add the &amp; CD ; title to the keywords ( English : day ) to add MP@@ 3@@ s with l@@ ame must be added to the switches from l@@ ame and the title parameter by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks as follows : &apos; ... @-@ tt { title } ... &apos; .
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button labels in the wizard ) :
&quot; that is what the free@@ DB is : a free database , in which people can read the audio CDs instead of input into the computer . it &apos;s noted that here only by text is spoken : &amp; CD ; title , artists , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not by the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( suppose the author ) am not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be added . any information can be given in any bum@@ ble@@ bee through a &amp; CD ; shop , physically or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is active an att@@ achments to choose ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it appears , the email address when retri@@ eving the data from the server did not use ( this can only know the programmer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; in many countries , there are copies of the main database . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; used for the use of free@@ DB , the geo@@ graphi@@ cally is needed to be used on the next lying mirror . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org offers a current list of mir@@ rors for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; alternatively you can download the complete database or ( normally monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which Out@@ line program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; stored in W@@ AV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ours that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; who wants to know more precisely , search in source code .... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD ; see to note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first , if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; to save the illuminated W@@ AV files , the enco@@ ders and therefore the desired file format can be chosen . at first opening there are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , og@@ gen@@ c ( O@@ G@@ Gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ ure of charge for audio data ) on the tab@@ s . other enco@@ ders can be added to this tab . &quot;
&quot; the co@@ ding package must be installed from the specified Linux distribution , before the code can be used . this is also required for the pre @-@ defined code . for more information on Ko@@ di@@ ers are found in the chapter World Wide Ko@@ di@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; after installing a code , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a con@@ sol@@ en@@ window ( eg . console ) . it must be replaced by the name of the installed code . &quot;
&quot; this can have many causes . check the decor of the device designation of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drives , the writing and reading device of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , og@@ gen@@ c for O@@ G@@ Gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) installed . try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal . this could give a clue to what is wrong . &quot;
&quot; check if you do not want to read a cop@@ ier @-@ protected audio CD ; read the envelope of the &amp; CD , which will not succeed ! &quot;
&quot; there is a chapter with one step by step . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have read the complete manual read everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well yes , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
in this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first &amp; CD . we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 224 to 256 k@@ bps on average and ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 key@@ word ( tags ) .
&quot; you have to be c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found for example with a search engine , as it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can naturally always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have my cry ( eg by trying to copy something ) with the con@@ quer@@ or .
the first section covers the basic setting of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably done only once and
the second section describes the procedure to read a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each out@@ going &amp; CD .
here we determine the resulting code for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 224 to 256 k@@ bps ) . it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used . since we are lazy to use the program to download the free@@ DB and load data from the Internet .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change it on any reading of a CD . change when the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is handed over to the reading programme therefore it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces can be read .
&quot; frequently / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running disk . if this is not working or if more than a &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , it can also provide a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the entries of the device awards for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card cam@@ els General settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here an additional conversion is defined . in our example everything is shown / entered / entered as shown in the scre@@ enshot .
&quot; only with incomplete information , so that you will be informed if information is missing for generating key@@ word ( tags ) . &quot;
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically downloaded over the Internet from a free@@ DB machine .
note : the machine must be available while reading the &amp; CD ; connected to the Internet to allow it to access the free@@ DB server .
&quot; the second selection field is easier , a &amp; CD ; entry is found immediately when you are not satisfied with the database entry and the fil@@ en@@ ame / fil@@ en@@ ame or tag entries , they can be changed easily . the directory entry and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , we continue to note : if you want to manually enter everything manually , select the selection fields and free@@ DB is not used . however , these are selected via 6@@ 20 MB in the offline mode , the two selection fields must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following cardboard card . &quot;
CD@@ DB is for us free@@ DB . these are settings for data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the free@@ DB server over the Internet . how does the system know which data is to get the CD ? read the section about free@@ DB .
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
CD@@ DB server : please go to the F@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity . on this path the load between the machines is distributed . however , this option will work as a first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both function equivalent to the server , because many fire@@ walls will boot the protocol 88@@ 80 default , maybe more luck with the protocol 80 , since the &amp; HTTP ; protocol usually is open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transfer any &amp; CD ; data to the free@@ DB server . the first tick @-@ box should be de@@ activated . &quot;
just take the settings of the scre@@ enshot . ( make sure the folder / t@@ mp exists on your computer )
&quot; number of simultaneous pieces : ap@@ ology , there is a reason why more than one simultaneously with just an existing drive ? parallel reading and co@@ ding ? the author does not know it , therefore simply try itself . &quot;
CD ; read after reading the last piece : cross this to the &amp; CD at the end of the process .
&quot; user @-@ defined folder for temporary files : when you cross this file , then the file / folder can be found if only space on another drive is available . this field is not enabled , the files in the private folder will not be enabled , if you want to do something with the W@@ AV files . &quot;
&quot; everything to enter as it is on the screen shot . the command is a bit long , under circumstances something to be turned to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as previously mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good Hi@@ Fi stereo . the resulting bit@@ rate factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption . &quot;
notice the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for the limitation of generating tags on version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1 &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 &apos; tags in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the full path ) and the output file ( including the full path ) .
put the rest like in the scre@@ enshot . some comments for future use outside this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously enco@@ ding W@@ AV files : for a dual @-@ core or a multi @-@ processor , it is possible to co @-@ code more than one W@@ AV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; in this section you describe how the process of reading the &amp; CD is described on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files , as we are comfortably described and the &amp; CD ; data from the free@@ DB must be described . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for any out@@ going &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD which is not yet contained in free@@ DB , the screen photos show a little different from the data for a &amp; CD ; with successfully used by free@@ DB . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually inser@@ tion , instead of releasing them from the Internet . comments will indicate the differences . &quot;
try not to find the &amp; CD ; this example is a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this is not yet done , then the &amp; CD has to be done now ; into the drive which was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment the pieces and their length were listed in the window , just like in the scre@@ enshot . this only when the &amp; CD is identified ; as an audio CD , could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , then you are looking for questions and answers after the help or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the &amp; CD was collected ; successfully picked up by the free@@ DB , all tracks of the pieces are already filled out and the name of the artist and album are displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &quot; unique &quot; &quot; CD ; -@@ key for your &amp; CD ; there &apos;s a window in appears , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the h@@ box for the automatic query by free@@ DB ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by choosing the first button of the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 2 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
type the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen photo . the title of the piece in the first row of the input field &apos; Cur@@ rent title &apos; to the rest of the data in the input field &apos; album &apos; .
the artist must no longer be inspired in the input field &apos; current title &apos; unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece .
the lower comment field can be used for the individual comments ini@@ di@@ gest@@ i per piece using the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all the pieces of the CD .
&quot; note : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the free@@ DB the CD editor is not empty , but it contains already the data as shown in the following scre@@ enshot . however , it is always a good idea to start the content of the CD editor ( e.g. whether all words are beginning with case letter or not ... ) , but also to check whether there are any unwanted remarks . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example we use only ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this is limited to the length of the fields on 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and only 28 characters for the comment@@ ators . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags ; this option is set up on the bug settings , then throw a look into the section &quot; basic settings &apos; . &quot;
you can change the tag @-@ information of the created files later anytime with the tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all co@@ di@@ ers or file formats . see the enco@@ ding for more information .
simply select an entry that is obviously with the style of the out@@ stretched CD ; in this example this is not important as we do the &amp; CD information anyway . for more information go to the website of fre@@ ed@@ b@@ .org and read the information about the categories . pop or rap for instance are found under rock .
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . simply click on the line with the second piece .
the Win@@ dow of the CD editor will appear again and you will see that the fields for the album have already been filled with the entered data that we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . the title of the piece is in any case and other information you wish .
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you entered all the title data of the &amp; CD .
attention : this window will not appear if you have downloaded the data from the free@@ DB . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed about the piece list .
&quot; note that there is a check @-@ sign in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are selected , or pressing the button Select all pieces select at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; was started by clicking on the button selection of the reading process , then this window appears to confirm . click OK and then we &apos;ll take a look at the window with the orders and follow what &apos;s going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the rider orders for switching on the order window . it is in the upper left half of the window , right under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window for controlling the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard disk . the status of the program will be displayed in the left part of the window in the status bar .
&quot; this error message you see if you are trying to work with a co@@ ding , which you have not installed yet . pieces which were not successfully enco@@ ded , marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the folder for the t@@ mp file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here for example . have you checked whether you write writing to the folder for temporary files and destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
&quot; now , it is clear why the error occurred directly after the end of the reading of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the enco@@ ding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . thus , read and enco@@ ding parallel . notice the status of the window in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
&quot; the author of the program has found no configuration settings to sup@@ press this behavior . the only thing is configur@@ able , the number of parallel processes to read and co@@ ding . with powerful machines the result is unclear . the machine using a AM@@ D@@ 64 appears to have no problem with simultaneous reading and enco@@ ding ( from however two different pieces ) . &quot;
&quot; now the last song is read , while another piece is co@@ ded , and a third order is co@@ ded in the queue of the code . after the last piece is co@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the co@@ ding of your choice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is now talking to CV@@ S as part of the k@@ dem@@ ul@@ ti@@ media package . if you are using CV@@ S , you can download from there an anonymous copy . most distri@@ butions are already included a pre @-@ compiled package . if you read this , you probably have done it already ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons who compile from source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package for distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs when it once runs , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls for many different programs , has many variants on settings . best read the step by step example to know the options and settings . it shows screen photos of the different box cards settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; hello , still on reading ? even if only the help menu has been clicked after the first start of the program , without any clue as it should go on from this somehow empty screen ( especially if at the time of the program do not be audio CD ; on the drive ) , or from an un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it all about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should somehow look like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no e @-@ mail . the author cannot add or change this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual on &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; unless you read it , or do it for contact with the author . and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; strange if you have succeeded in getting the source file from &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and Car@@ av@@ esp@@ iel@@ he von &amp; k@@ de ; . besides others he has not have some features with real @-@ time and car@@ y@@ cam model high@@ lighting of texts also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI player did not have .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; running under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the OS@@ S system , so should work on all systems with OS@@ S and &amp; k@@ de ; support also included the &amp; Linux ; ultr@@ am@@ ound proj@@ ector , which is needed for CIS cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ en@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with variable color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of activity of each MIDI @-@ channel through the high@@ lighting of the pressed buttons on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; Drop so that you can drag in &amp; k@@ de ; each MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ par@@ or ; window can be drawn to K@@ Mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text in MIDI files ( rec@@ ti@@ dings or text events ) . K@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used in each case .
&quot; when you stop &amp; k@@ de ; when you finish a song , K@@ mid starts again with the same song again next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , awe , FM and CIS cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can open ... out of the menu file . it appears the usual file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ par@@ or ; window into the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ window drop . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a music piece , open it and pressing the button &quot; &quot; play in tool@@ bar , select the entry section from the menu item or pressing the space bar . &quot;
&quot; please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece automatically starts , once you go it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; -@@ Win@@ dow . ( in several pieces , they are added to a collection and then re@@ played a row . ) &quot;
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece is playing , you can jump to any location by using the middle mouse button and drive with the controller back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is too fast or too slow down , you can click the arrows left and right of the Tem@@ po@@ stage and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double @-@ click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar as a pressure on the button break or selecting the menu entry into the menu item , so break the playback . pressing the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; the playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored on two types in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and others both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid ; you can set which events are to be displayed and even better : the Ere@@ ign@@ ant type is automatically selected , which is selected a song , so you don &apos;t have to adjust anything manually . however , if you want to change anything manually using the menu settings . however , you still have the possibility to change this , if you want the other species . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set an E@@ ign@@ ant type , select from the menu settings the entries text events or property events . the same function also have keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files which you summ@@ arise . these are played the row after playing . in this section stands , how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
to put a collection you first open the Collec@@ tor manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the item Organ@@ ize .... Click there on New and give the name to the collection .
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and selecting the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs as the original one .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can arrange the wish in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all the songs you want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . concerns you when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it must be selected in the collector manager . there , you can add a song by adding a song . in turn , the file dialog , with whose help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic adding to the collection .
&quot; when automatic adding is enabled to the collection , a piece can be added to the active collection by opening ( using File Open or D@@ rag &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; if automatic add to the collection is not activated , when opening a piece , the temporary collection is activated and loc@@ ates . this collection will then be added to the still opened pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click removing . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played down . if you select the series according to the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order will be re @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collector manager , or use the selective list of the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to jump a song further , select the button next song , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow right . &quot;
&quot; to catch a song back , select the button previous piece , the record previous piece out of the menu item or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection and click on the button Dele@@ te . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not matter because it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid ; it is not saved . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ izer , which are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case the MIDI @-@ Map general @-@ MIDI events can be translated into events that synthes@@ iz@@ ers the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which conver@@ ts all events of the type Change patch to B@@ right Piano in events of the type Change patch to Tr@@ ump@@ et and therefore always sound a trumpet , if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have a sound card , you do not need any MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . awe and CIS cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you need to edit the corresponding file from hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that saves all required re@@ alizations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section can only appear once , except the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section , which may appear as often as desired . however , that each occurrence exists a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
De@@ fine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D De@@ fine KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P &quot; Name of Key@@ board ... &quot; EN@@ D De@@ fine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P ... EN@@ D Options ... EN@@ D
&quot; you can see that De@@ fine is needed to indicate that a section starts ( except for Options ) and EN@@ D , that the end of a section is reached . &quot;
&quot; please send me your map file as e @-@ mail , so that I can provide in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible . &quot;
in this section is indicated as the patches of General MIDI using your specific keyboard . the general usage looks like follows :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equ@@ ino@@ x is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches in the right sequence ( from 0 to 127 ) , you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ key@@ s@@ To M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M . if your key@@ boards do not support the gun ( GM patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which is similar to a gun tip . to do this , enter the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section : &quot;
&quot; therefore , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 ( a barrel signal ) , it takes patch 100 ( the Drum on your keyboard ) and plays the tone 60 , independent of which tone is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here with the term &quot; &quot; drum patch &quot; &quot; patch , in which each tone represents another Persian document ( drum , pel@@ vis , mar@@ acas &amp; etc ; ) and not one who means sound the sound level of the always same drum ( like some key@@ boards ) . &quot;
the KE@@ Y@@ MA@@ P section is used to indicate how sounds on a specific channel or instrument are shown .
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MA@@ P section , the order of lines is very important , as well their presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only have to use different names in the first line .
Key@@ maps are mainly used to make notes on the per@@ k@@ disk channel . take a look at as an example the supplied key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to form some channels to others . if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel , simply enter the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards , which have the perc@@ ussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MA@@ P section therefore has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , built according to the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; n &apos;s the channel , which is listed on the channel N . if you use key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to use the name name for this channel . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel . in this case , always patch x uses . &quot;
the For@@ ce@@ patch option can be useful for example to always use the per@@ tin@@ ent patch on the per@@ k@@ disk channel .
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ rati@@ o indicates which relation to Pit@@ ch @-@ Ben@@ der @-@ events multip@@ lies with the value n , this with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) is calculated and then only passed on . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file no dec@@ imal number is available ) . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard , which is supposed to play key@@ boards with the value 40@@ 96 , a sound higher . unfortunately , however , try to try some key@@ boards up to an oc@@ tave higher . to try the correct value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit using &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the dialog box settings . these can be found in the menu under settings , point MIDI settings &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ vi@@ atures ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on this pi@@ qu@@ atures see which sounds are being played straight .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selective list where you can choose an instrument , the button doesn &apos;t seem more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the can@@ al@@ view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played notes . view in the menu settings at the point of the channel view : settings
&quot; the speed @-@ LCD shows speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the pace of a song . so if you find e.g. , a song is too fast to follow the text , you can slow it down . to change the pace , use the arrows left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information on how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , the rhythm , the speed , &amp; etc . therefore , the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results , just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way . &quot;
&quot; well , I can force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 @-@ file will need 4 MB ( a compression rate of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer ( a compression rate of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer , you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; that can happen if you have a binary distribution ( r@@ pm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; have this happened because &amp; k@@ mid ; without awe @-@ support compiled . to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s home ) &quot;
&quot; I would like to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add any files individually . &quot;
&quot; agree , therefore supported &amp; k@@ mid ; D@@ rag &amp; Drop . simply open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all the files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
activate the option of automatic adding to the collection in advance . otherwise the files are added to temporary collection .
you can click the arrow key to the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow the playback . to restore the default temp@@ o you can double click on the LCD screen .
I have a &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ desktop with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or scre@@ wed up ( if I want a kar@@ aoke file ) or I want to play a file merely into the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; window changes and the desired file into the window of &amp; k@@ mid ;
&quot; if you want to listen quickly to a file without adding to a collection , turn off the option of automatic adding to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to temporary collection . opening files &quot;
&quot; suppose you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mi@@ d. First you just want to play the first file . so make the option automatic adding to the collection and open A.@@ mi@@ xes your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people have sent me MIDI files or post@@ cards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , anim@@ ate me further to &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; I studied mathematics at the University of Ma@@ ze ; Lag@@ a . at the moment I am writing a bit of time for my Hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my Hob@@ bies but I try to collect MIDI files , make music and prove sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where they can download MIDI / kar@@ aoke files , if you want to make a question , an error , or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ ra@@ gu@@ .@@ es &quot;

&quot; my thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ chez for testing the CIS support , has Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Mr. Gr@@ it@@ sch , Mr. Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ur@@ ko L@@ usa , Peter @-@ Paul Witt@@ a , Thor@@ sten Wes@@ er , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , a fault notification or even an supportive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course my thanks also to all these excellent musicians on the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; additionally , &amp; k@@ mid ; also found on his homepage , which is found under htt@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ ra@@ gu@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mid@@ .@@ html . on the homepage you can find links to sites with further kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
sound card . I recommend you a good sound@@ card or an external synthes@@ izer as the sound quality depends on your sound card . it is not the same if you use a FM @-@ device or a awe @-@ card .
&quot; if you have no sound card , you have to compile and c@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t hear any music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ or ; mailing lists or send a error notification directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is a simple interface for M@@ Player , Ph@@ ono and FF@@ M@@ peg . the program is used to play video files of files supported by M@@ Player or Ph@@ on@@ on supported formats , as well as to play DVD , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ name ; was not yet finished as &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this machine .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website to new versions , or to send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there &apos;s always the window with the central view . either , there is the window with the playlist . and finally there is a information window that will only appear if information is reflected in it . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to track the prefer@@ ential connections under the menu book@@ mark , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played by one , so you should use the category S@@ ame playlist . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy of hierarch@@ ies . if you follow an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the reproduction begins with the requested entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current piece &apos; , TV and continuous play@@ lists can also be changed by direct editing the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do that if &amp; cra@@ p / k@@ m@@ player / , can only be changed by one editor , but also through the application itself . simply click on a name of a category cli@@ que , select from the menu view and select only the XML content of this part . &quot;
&quot; after modification of XML files , must be chosen from the menu items selected with playlist and select either the editing mode , or another category selected . &quot;
&quot; all changes are lost when editing mode is abandoned , or another group is selected without using the playlist . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; k@@ m@@ player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
&quot; the animation during Star@@ ts and Be@@ enden can be disabled by the editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ err@@ c and change from &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 above option on &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not available , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to activate a different animation . &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / k@@ m@@ players / Ac@@ m@@ player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml note . the format must be an supported XML file .
&quot; the animation at Star@@ ts needs not to be short , it is automatically termin@@ ated by opening a different source . however , this would end in the end @-@ animation however , the user can therefore end the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the viewing of one favourite picture : &amp; lt ; sm@@ iles ; &amp; lt ; IM@@ G D@@ ur = &quot; &quot; in &quot; &quot; sr@@ c / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; fit = &quot; meet ; &quot; in the source package of &amp; k@@ m@@ players ; are listed in the directory tests / some examples of SM@@ IL that are supported by &amp; k@@ m@@ players . &quot;
&quot; there is a rider for the configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; here , the path of the M@@ Player and the inter@@ memory size of the data stream from the network and other things can be adjusted . &quot;
another tool for troubles@@ hooting is the button &apos; console &apos; in tool@@ bar of k@@ m@@ player . here is the output of m@@ player .
&quot; there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; everything must be configured using manual editing of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ w@@ c , just like setting the back@@ end via mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa &apos;s module : &quot;
&quot; Flash &apos;@@ can be played within &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; it can even be added to the special box em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML . &quot;
&quot; so that the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; &apos; flash &apos; can reproduce in HTML pages , the &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; module as service provider for the m@@ ime type @-@ type / x @-@ Sho@@ ck@@ wave @-@ flash in the interior dialog file orders by K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ cre@@ or or &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; is able to launch in a consoles application and following error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . the stolen process is conc@@ aten@@ ating . if there are no mistakes , the back@@ end issue is inside &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; hence , a pre@@ op@@ pressing back@@ end for a particular m@@ ime type is taken ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manual change of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ m@@ play@@ gu@@ c . for example , phon@@ ebook is to reproduce all og@@ g files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ player ; can play from TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be looked , the scanner can be configured using the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be manually edited . &quot;
&quot; to configur@@ ing the V@@ DR ( Video Information Rek@@ order ) settings in k@@ m@@ player , the dialog in the settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le@@ - &gt; V@@ DR@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port to use . there , ports should be found ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a DV@@ B contained therein . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ video is also supported ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one working ) . this is also necessary only on the first screen ( 0.@@ 0 ) . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server therefore must include the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally used by KM@@ player used different names for sources . at the time of the origin of this documentation this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d source , pi@@ p@@ es@@ our@@ ce , t@@ v@@ otive , source source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . if they are activated , they start playing the playlist . &quot;
are there hints like I can make my CD@@ ROM drive qui@@ eter if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ e 8 / dev / c@@ drom is designed as a user root after inser@@ ting the device . it is absolutely safe to put that / dev / c@@ drom on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; X@@ ine only slowly start , why every time my CPU has to be tested on its performance ? &quot;
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taking . k@@ x@@ ine@@ player automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time the CPU will check the CPU . &quot;

l@@ atex ; : a professional writer application . under Unix @-@ like systems is probably returned to the package &amp; tex@@ live ; respectively &amp; Tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
&quot; most of these components can be included in the included &amp; Linux ; for installation , the documentation of the distribution or installation disc ; / DVD should be used . &quot;
the &amp; ki@@ le ; -@@ Project contains some already compiled packages of &amp; ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow simple installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the ki@@ le ; -@@ website included .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; l@@ atex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; or hu@@ ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; advanced users must hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation must be taken into account . however , the support for this project or its documentation needs to be made in contact with the ki@@ le ; -@@ website . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or for the compile of &amp; ki@@ le ; on or are extensions desired , this should be addressed on the mailing list ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; l@@ atex ; environment for the &amp; B ; -@@ working surface . it also offers a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; l@@ atex ; programs . furthermore , the possibility to complete , comp@@ iling and editing tools for this . finally , the easy to use assistant , the &amp; l@@ atex ; reference and the powerful project management . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; K@@ ate ; and to know his possibilities , the manual should be taken to k@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can begin directly with reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin . &quot;
for &amp; l@@ atex ; is the right out@@ fits : L@@ ay @-@ TECH . after use the ur@@ spr@@ ite &amp; tex ; difficult to use is also a La@@ ie ( English . L@@ ay ) &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ mac@@ ros is that it is from the surname of Les@@ lie La m@@ port .
&quot; here is only a good news to get &amp; l@@ atex ; given , it is not the ultimate book . to be able to control properly , good banners should be able to master correctly . : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced Users , 3rd edition , 1999 d@@ af@@ Ã ¼ rich . &quot;
&quot; just as other mark@@ up languages involves &amp; l@@ atex ; an introduction , with which the most general features like paper format , number num@@ eric and text box begins with the text . the introduction begins with the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { document } and must be closed using the command \ \ \ } document . &quot;
the Quick @-@ entry @-@ assistant of &amp; ki@@ le ; is a new feature for the fast creation of a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some options for creating the document .
&quot; documentation : this is hereby to specify the type of document document : article ( article ) , book &#91; report &#93; , report &#91; report &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; GS &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; author &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; proj@@ ector &#93; , proj@@ ector &#91; proj@@ ector &#93; , fo@@ ils &#91; ... &#93; &quot;
co@@ ding : hereby the string code is set . modern systems are increasingly used to use the UT@@ F @-@ 8 enco@@ ding as standard . at best UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ x should be selected ( for the correct processing of &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ documents ) .
this list contains the most used additional packages for l@@ atex ; for the inclusion they only have to be covered in the cross @-@ field .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document@@ aries of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . they should be used in the preparation of German texts . &quot;
new users now don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a brief description of the functions and further information about this in the section .
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source text editors - the high@@ lighting of the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . through &amp; ki@@ le ; however , you should not notice that some mathematical environment is not closed . however , you should save it by the modest appearance of output file . however , it will save you by the high@@ lighting time and on the screen . &quot;
&quot; by entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { Command } ) from &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically created a space line ( to the input of the text ) and the associated line to the end of the command ( e.g. \ \ ) { Command } . this function can be activated in the menu settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands . &quot;
all documents are usually divided into some elements . &amp; l@@ atex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the most beautiful and subtle element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structural dimension , the single elements can be changed and viewed by one click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; l@@ atex ; files can be very helpful in creating your own &amp; l@@ atex file . as soon as a DV@@ I file ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ tegr@@ file ) &#93; created , jumps &amp; ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button at the DV@@ I ; viewer about the corresponding line in &amp; l@@ atex ; source text . &quot;
&quot; a DV@@ I ; file contained a description of the form@@ at@@ ted document and also other information like the font and is beside PDF the available output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; there are many tools to view , conversion and print of DV@@ I ; files for different systems and scent . &quot;
&quot; when using the rating search , the elements of the DV@@ I ; file with the editor loaded and once on an element in the DV@@ I ; the code is lowered , becomes the exact opposite of it . once on a section in &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is clicked , becomes the appropriate point in DV@@ I ; -@@ viewer . &quot;
Master @-@ document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a Master @-@ document the work is simplified with others .@@ tex files . in the use of a project a project @-@ wide master document can be set for project settings .
fast : the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if no errors in the source code is available ) .
file watch@@ making : in this mode the DV@@ I ; -@@ file on the scale of the event and it does not take a call by &amp; Ok@@ ular ; according to the super@@ structure .
&quot; in case of checking the tool@@ bar , the three sets of choices should be noticeable in the document . the selection fields have been developed for fast inser@@ tion of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... Re@@ ver@@ sible &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ orders for the sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the header area is for installation of articles such as tags , fu@@ ther , notes or wise . the available possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or a different element is created . &quot;
&quot; reference : is used for reference to a fixed name ( selection , a selection menu ) . &quot;
&quot; when using quote becomes a selective list with literary night@@ club . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files are appropriate editors necessary . the author has good experience with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; files can also be written in &amp; ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down with the name of Gr@@ Ã ¼ e will be used for defining the font , for the main text , which are specified on the main text , the joints , etc. are available to : &quot;
&quot; at the call of &amp; ki@@ le ; are two choices of selection : 1 . the wizard for the creation of a new document through selection of document types , and fixed settings . 2 . the document may be written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the brack@@ ets according to the command \ \ document@@ ations contain the settings for the command . the settings &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; determines the fonts . if the scri@@ be does not set at the beginning , this can also occur in the text . &quot;
once the original source code has been entered the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is the use of the building or of the button fast @-@ fitting .
the source code must be stored in front of the comp@@ iling . &amp; ki@@ le ; for storage is automatically saved .
&quot; the comp@@ iling of the document was missing , should be searched in the log file after the errors . when using quick @-@ installation should be started &amp; Ok@@ ular ; this is not the case , this should also be observed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( English environment ) is a text which is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the scri@@ be is called 12 and only a few S@@ Ã tz@@ e should have a different scri@@ be . the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } , then the impact of the font in the surroundings . &quot;
the fees are limited only inside the area ( from \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN } to \ \ \ { environment environment ) . there are no sign@@ age ( number ) for spending money in an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , under@@ printing , sub@@ sub@@ missions , etc. are added . these commands may end either with the command \ \ or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { emp@@ t } : this command is closed for the intensive printing and is long as long as it is closed with a \ \ with { emp@@ t } or another environment . a single word in one sentence can be shown with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ ratio : created a quotation in the document . the quotation begins with \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { rate } and ends with \ \ &apos; { ratio } .
&quot; after writing the source text with the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ recording language , now follows a step @-@ to @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; once in the wizard a bit of text was entered , a few adjustments should be taken to the better read@@ ability of the document . therefore , there should be a quotation , some places in fat and cur@@ sive pressure , and a poem to be used to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , using editor @-@ view or str@@ g E can return to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . in an external viewer , the window must be closed . &quot;
&quot; once the DV@@ I file has been created , the document may be printed or converted into a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file can be converted . simply try out and spa@@ wn . &quot;
DV@@ I ; is a perfect file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ oses ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; l@@ atex ; for the read@@ ability of some drivers of your computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printer , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF -@@ Um@@ wand@@ ler or computer screen . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DV@@ I file , the same steps as for the creation of the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DV@@ I can be printed ( if the printer is correct ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of DV@@ I ; file into other formats . once the DV@@ I ; file from the &amp; l@@ atex ; source code was created , the conversion can begin into known other formats using the kno@@ b in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the default search gives you a direct jump from the editor to the associated position within the DV@@ I file ; file .
&amp; ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ bin@@ der files . you just have to set up modern under settings Ki@@ le ... tools building .
&quot; to cover the default search , the mouse @-@ cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and should be clicked on the outskirts of the DV@@ I ; the viewer is done so . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DV@@ I ; document the appropriate &amp; l@@ atex ; document from &amp; ki@@ le ; open and to the corresponding line are specified ( settings Ok@@ ular form ... Editor )
&quot; should when using quick @-@ to @-@ use of &amp; DV@@ I ; viewer &apos;s not possible , an error may be available . should an error exist , this will be displayed in the log file or in the news window in summary . &quot;
&quot; the log file lists the error source in the source code . in the editor you can see the pop @-@ layer bugs . the log file will always be the line in which the error appears . to see the error in the log file , and &amp; ki@@ le ; jump to faul@@ ty line . &quot;
&quot; once on the corresponding button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to choose the template for the document . the featured possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; if you choose an empty document , a document may be written either due to newly written or the wizard for quick creation of a new document . further information can be included in the section . &quot;
&quot; extensive user of &amp; l@@ atex ; usually use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either a existing &amp; tex ; - / l@@ atex ; file opened or a new file will be created . &amp; ki@@ le ; can create a new template using an existing document and selection of file template for document . &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using file , some string will be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or sign enco@@ ding ) . these variables can set up in settings g@@ le ... settings General will be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which character strings from which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ : this string will be replaced by input in document class . typically , it is used to use : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ ME@@ NT@@ C@@ LA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TI@@ ONS $ $ &#93; { items } . &quot;
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the exec@@ uting of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created by the following steps :
&quot; when creating a new document , the template will be required instead of default . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any l@@ atex ; files created , a simple way to create a template should be sought after one on the Internet and the steps described below . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; used &amp; K@@ ate ; as an internal editor . &amp; K@@ ate ; is a text editor for programmers with the flexibility of reading and high@@ lighting ; many different types of text files ( including &amp; l@@ atex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) can be done in the menu directly off &amp; ki@@ le ;
&quot; to learn more over &amp; K@@ ate ; and to learn his possibilities , the manual should be taken from K@@ ate . users of &amp; ki@@ le ; can start there directly by reading the chapter with the editor of &amp; K@@ ate ; begin . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a very practical &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ command reference , which can be called the menu of La@@ Te@@ X reference , which can be found in &amp; l@@ atex ; usage as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; a double @-@ click with a &quot; &quot; Str@@ ong button &quot; &quot; to choose the &amp; tex ; word to cover . that means that in this way , when clicking on \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ . &quot;
&quot; when writing the text with a penetr@@ ated left mouse button , the text will automatically be copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow buttons , it is possible to cover parts of the source text in the editor &apos;s window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; has the possibilities to search for different kinds of source texts and to highlight them . for example , the &amp; l@@ atex rules vary from normal text and also mathematical formul@@ ae are distinguished by another color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can choose the ski jumping marks . this is a one &apos;s own kind of book@@ marks within the text . thereby , this spr@@ int is highlighted so that it is automatically converted to the first input of a sign . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects of using a program like &amp; ki@@ le ; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already excellent features , has been added in &amp; ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; l@@ atex ; special commands for their selection . under editing pane , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; after a paragraph includes a complete paragraph ( group of lines that contain a blank line ) , with a paragraph there is not a text with different lines ( as described in other text editor ) . this extended meaning is not meant to be a text with different lines ( such as in other text editor ) . the only bent thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the only col@@ lu@@ ent thing in &amp; ki@@ le ; is that the only col@@ lu@@ ent thing are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; select the word under the current cur@@ sor@@ b position . this selection has also an extended meaning , since this command also &amp; l@@ atex ; commands with a ru@@ gged star ( \ \ ) and an extra star ( * ) . &quot;
&quot; to get a part of the document may vary widely , and by the button to be removed . &amp; K@@ ate ; offers the key@@ hole C@@ tr@@ l ; K with which the whole line is removed . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers with its own commands thereby include faster possibilities . under editing removal , the following commands are included in the writing of the text : &quot;
&quot; remove a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; ki@@ le ; is included in the description of the Edit section . &quot;
&quot; it has already been indicated that environments play a central role in &amp; l@@ atex ; therefore , &amp; ki@@ le ; for NF further commands under editing environment , offers excellent easy work with &amp; l@@ atex ; &quot;
this command returns to the top of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly in front of the command to watch the surrounding area .
this command returns to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly behind the command to the end of the environment .
&quot; if the cursor before or inside the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { Environment } is located , the end of the environment is pr@@ un@@ ed ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many spar@@ ed Environ@@ ments commands , quickly the opportunity has lost sight of this command . this command fell on the last dev@@ out environment so that the sp@@ elled ambient structure does not exist . &quot;
&amp; ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ groups which are determined by brack@@ ets { ... } . under the Te@@ X group are a few important commands to meet those from editing environment .
this command returns to the top of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly in front of the wel@@ ded cl@@ amp cl@@ amp .
with this command this command returns to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . cursor is placed directly behind the wel@@ ded cl@@ amps &apos; brack@@ ets &apos; brack@@ et .
&quot; if the cursor is before or behind the stri@@ ped cl@@ amp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is , becomes the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; when entering many spar@@ ed groups @-@ clas@@ ps , quickly the opportunity has lost sight over . this command fell on the recently opened group , so the missing structure of the &amp; tex ; -@@ groups are not f@@ oul . &quot;
in &amp; l@@ atex ; are used two simple layout characters used in &amp; ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; for two simple application signs will be used . &amp; ki@@ le ; knows this case and are two slept flas@@ hing signs for &amp; l@@ atex ;
this automatic inser@@ tion of double occupancy can be set up under settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X - and left @-@ out .
&quot; there can be many other languages ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , and can be used by German or fran@@ k signs . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; while Shift key ; input taste for a smart character . if the current position is located within a lists area ( e.g. enumer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , for example the current position inside a lists area ( e.g. enumer@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , but also the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; inside a tables area , Du@@ t &amp; ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ \ with an all @-@ lying dra@@ gging break . &quot;
even better - &amp; ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pre@@ arranged &amp; l@@ atex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . they can set up under settings ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X added .
&quot; some users want to arrange path@@ ways in tables and thereby all E@@ t @-@ signs ( amp ; ) among each other . &amp; ki@@ le ; seeks to encourage this . while this regul@@ ator is not liable in the opposite table , although this regul@@ ator is not the associated side , for the columns position of the current tab@@ s . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; K@@ ate ; already offers a good source code completion , this was installed in &amp; ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; l@@ atex ; ) even three modes of operation are installed . all of these modes can be set up for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for automatic completion . all of these modes can be set up for automatic completion . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment by means of the command \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN { environment } becomes &amp; ki@@ le ; automatically add the command \ \ \ { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; on the top of the bar , the last letter of the input is removed and can be enchanted by doing the completion list . on the other hand , the list may also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a brief description of their parameter . alternatively , descriptions can be confirmed by selection of a command . alternatively , the flip marks can be confirmed , so that a simply jump to these positions can be seen by editing diving marks as well as the winding parameters then . &quot;
&quot; under settings ki@@ le ; set up , you can choose settings to these lists . there can be different types of wine lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ orders as well as bad@@ ges of the general language used . &quot;
&quot; the commands mode is non @-@ linear . there are always a few letters to be entered with \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN and the call of ship@@ building mode is often used that &amp; ki@@ le ; and on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; ki@@ le ; a special mode for completion of the environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the purchase mode , the menu is automatically falling into the surrounding area or the key@@ word &quot; &quot; Alt + Shift key &quot; &quot; button , the command returns to the simplest way and it appears \ \ B@@ EG@@ IN . after that , the ambient temperature can be continued and through it the input is set to be finished . &quot;
&quot; since this is accomplished , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; ki@@ le ; recognizes that this is a lists area , is even a first \ \ item command with frozen . &quot;
&quot; under settings ki@@ le ; set up , you can create settings for these lists . this mode uses the mon@@ k list of vertical mode for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; l@@ atex ; -@@ commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which are immediately set up by L@@ Ã ¼ r@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ wl , in which example the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L entered and the word processing mode , the character is introduced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X ( the letter L \ \ La@@ Te@@ X ) . &quot;
&quot; rough sket@@ ches are not helpful for automatic ship@@ ments . however , it has been noted that many waf@@ ers are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; ki@@ le ; the completion of all that was already written . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu of Ki@@ le ... Ki@@ le Ver@@ fully shiel@@ ded . here , the swelling can also be specified for viewing on completion . &quot;
&quot; installation files can be installed in the sub@@ folder ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / ti@@ le / etc / mode / the Per@@ s@@ Ã ¶ n@@ able Home folder . mode is available for signature ( Rec@@ ent ) , Dic@@ tionary ( W@@ ays ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialogue Graphi@@ cs features the installation of graphics as simple as possible . on the basis of the basics of the graphics , the sections should be observed and observed . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well known as PDF files , but offer a superb basis for spending and re @-@ ordin@@ ances of pages . the PDF output allows the pages to be arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools newly arranged and then converted with p@@ s@@ 2@@ pdf in a PDF file . &quot;
&quot; to choose the outcome of the work , the source code must be compiled . all construction tools are group@@ ed in the menus , create , create and create a view . &quot;
for the comp@@ iling of the source code for viewers such as &amp; Ok@@ ular ; or the further conversion can be used the key@@ code of Alt ; 2 . after that the DV@@ I ; -@@ file opened in a PS file and can be viewed by Alt ; 5 the PS file .
&quot; when using the command quick@@ ening instruction , a viewer is being called after comp@@ iling . should not be used in an in@@ quired viewer , every time a new window will emerge . &quot;
a new project will be launched for the project . here the following information for the project is canc@@ eled :
&quot; when looking out the fil@@ en@@ ame window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ ki@@ lep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; ki@@ le ; allows the exec@@ ut@@ ches of EC@@ MA@@ Script co@@ de . the scripts can be managed in the vertical track .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet developed , and can be found in other versions of &amp; ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the comp@@ atri@@ ation environment of the scripts in &amp; ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = ki@@ le ) has the following methods : &quot;
&quot; l@@ atex ; is a quite clear system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the user . &quot;
&amp; Tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . this includes a documentation for the included packages and one more &amp; l@@ atex ; reference .
&quot; a complete refer@@ n@@ z for &amp; tex ; and then , by the Fre@@ un@@ de@@ â Group , this is not only a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) but rather is an accomplished manual for a specific form@@ atting . since it is a very rough document , it is divided into &amp; ki@@ le ; in three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; due to the amount of documents with those &amp; Tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; shipped , the finding of the correct document is not always easy . as possible help , / tex@@ tual ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k that covers a database with all the products &amp; ki@@ le ; supplied in documents and this for a graphic upper area . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the advantage is the search for package name or stro@@ lling . by &amp; ki@@ le ; only the results are shown . &quot;
a double @-@ click with the mouse or the bed of space is the viewer for the document .
&amp; ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ id and user @-@ friendly &amp; l@@ atex ; - / tex ; -@@ source code known for different architec@@ tures of &amp; Linux ; - and Unix ; is also part of the Fink project , whereby &amp; ki@@ le ; also available on Mac ; with installed OS X @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who are looking for the continuance of the &amp; ki@@ le ; project endeav@@ ors for the development of tools , which we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU / GNU / license . current information on the contribut@@ ors can be found in the surrounding area . &quot;

&quot; anyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation conf@@ essed pro@@ c and as over@@ ra@@ ving it is . do we raise it a piece , we give it a graphical interface ! no longer reli@@ ed on a terminal ; simply click on a symbol for the XML @-@ processor and finished ! &quot;
&quot; this application is expected to be an inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is stored in the folder , then leave the current job folder , and enter the desired folder in the field of other folder . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML ; files will be deleted every time when sp@@ c .
&quot; as already said , everyone who has worked at the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation has already worked , knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens , now there is a great graphical interface for this . &quot;
&quot; if the currently opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book , then let it simply select the current job folder . if not , then select current work@@ folders and enter the folder , where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
if it comes to an issue on the screen her file is flawless . please check the errors and try again .
&quot; if the file is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult , then it simply leave the file . if not , delete it up to the file and select the file using other file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if they only want to know if the file well @-@ site is , then click the Well @-@ to check selection . &quot;
&quot; for use of a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; ( default ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( external ) , otherwise &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( external ) and input it the location of &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; ( external ) ; diagram as well as for the Relax@@ NG review is the indication of the definition UR@@ I ; in file selection required . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has also a &amp; X@@ SL ; -@@ processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the li@@ b@@ x@@ m@@ l@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file should be in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already marked , the current file is simply chosen . if not , remove the selected file and select the file file using the other file file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result is named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even have little to do . this , the plug @-@ in system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and must not wait until someone uses the desired into &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; they can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI ; elements can be found further down . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a box , we start with the menu plugins . this will open the following dialog : &quot;
&quot; this dialog allows to manage all the included ins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI , element in it : &quot;
&quot; here you can enter the search box . when adding a plug @-@ ins without a location , you use &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to the search of the plug @-@ in . &quot;
often working on a project several persons in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relation to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the information of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nickname is the nickname of the user and serves as unique identification .
one member may have multiple roles in the project like team leader as well as sub@@ project leaders .
the user can choose from the list of the team members who he is . this happens by sending the team member from the list and the button re@@ plac@@ eable . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears f@@ ett after you are : text .
nickname and setting of your own identity are important regarding news and remarks . see for further information .
&quot; in addition to the overview of their team there is another advantage by recording the members of the team : there may be an event created for the information to the team manager , if something else happens . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are implemented if something particular is happening in the project . an example would be seen as much someone worked on it , or sending a message if a file is secured , or a script that sends a file to the CV@@ S as soon as it gets added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the side of events configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings Di@@ alo@@ ges , events can be edited , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the addres@@ see in the recipient list . the addres@@ see can be a team or sub@@ project manager . see in , we@@ i such ladder are set up . &quot;
comments are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by following things :
&quot; to enter comments is simple . either the note file selected from the editor @-@ context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation key@@ word in a commentary area , followed by typ@@ ologies . &quot;
&quot; comments may be sent a fixed member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nickname ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , with the nickname of the registered nickname of the team member , should be given a role in the project of the following possibilities : team leader in sub@@ project leaders should be given the relevant departments or sub @-@ project leaders , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nickname and roll names are independent of large or small letters , but spaces around the brack@@ ets and the : make the note invali@@ d . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and form@@ atting languages , the D@@ T@@ D agnos@@ tic and web@@ based form@@ ative and scrip@@ ting languages supported . &quot;
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ specific settings are dealt with , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
the settings can be set up using settings Qu@@ anta ... to be called . this dialog extends over some pages that are dealt with in succession .
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; regarding tags including car complete may be altered . the entries are :
&quot; large / ins@@ cription of tags : large / small , of automatically deposited tags . normal bulk / small letters , the tags are inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / small ins@@ cription of attributes : large / small ins@@ cription of automatically attached attributes . normal Groß / Klein@@ ins@@ cription implies , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the day XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if requested , is optional for tags , for which the end day is optional , this immediately after the bed ; inserted . &quot;
&quot; non @-@ optional tags automatically include : as above all other tags , except for easy tags . &quot;
&quot; start @-@ up and finish @-@ tag automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ entu@@ ated characters into the corresponding enco@@ ding during the ti@@ pping .
m@@ ime @-@ types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es to detect different types of files . by means of default the default ones can restore the default ones .
&quot; standard Dia code : the enco@@ ding of newly created or otherwise used as file opening files ( where the co@@ ding of the file can be passed ) , but this setting will be extinct from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; standard D@@ T@@ D : the selected D@@ T@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose D@@ T@@ D has not been recognized . but this attitude will be extinct from the same in the project characteristics , if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &quot; &quot; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult &quot; &quot; created regularly backup copies , so that in the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as storing the file . also for not stored documents , backup is created regularly , according to the specified period . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editing area or a separate view ( or the documentation in a divi@@ der ) , which makes it possible to look at the documentation , the preview and the source code at the same time . &quot;
set the shut@@ ters to the standard returns at the next start is useful when the user interface came through inter@@ change the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cks / depend on views carried out . it corresponds to the --@@ pres@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning @-@ in area serves to control the possibility to prevent the display of warnings by att@@ aching to non @-@ queries .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it may change the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the code view in the shared mode . in terms of different modes see . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of the par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the click @-@ clicking on the structural tree , the following action is possible to change the action by clicking the struc@@ tree with the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural changes , the Visi@@ bility of No@@ des in the tree will be automatically opened to editing and how deep in changing the structure tree will be automatically opened . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are such , in which the current document has not been found . &quot;
&quot; the range for forti@@ fications of abbrevi@@ ations ( a type of templates ) , which are un@@ divided in groups , each one can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s valid , it can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be valid , it can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ le abbrevi@@ ation somewhat different means being valid in a group for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here the plug @-@ ins can be managed . plugins are K@@ Part @-@ applications from the third page , which can be re @-@ used by every single @-@ capable application , most known &amp; con@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ ins , the following must be stated : &quot;
address : the path to the plug @-@ in if it is not on a standard like $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / lib .
&quot; input : this information will be passed to the plugin when you start , it is possible to open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
&quot; component in &quot; &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; &quot; mode : check if the plug @-@ in is denied the store . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ s deny the store , if this option is not chosen . &quot;
&quot; test the plugin : is this enabled , then tests &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult , if the indicated information is correct . select also when the plug @-@ in is not available , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; from version 3.3 , the bug is completely re@@ designed . th@@ iev@@ ing for the no longer necessary built &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) de@@ bu@@ gger was dis@@ continued , as well as the support for the db@@ g de@@ bu@@ gger . instead of which a de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in concept was implemented , which allows various implementation @-@ in @-@ ins . &quot;
&quot; currently , only one plugin is available , support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ iring ; inser@@ ts . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in in the project settings . with the button options next to the de@@ bu@@ gger plug @-@ in the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some extra elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitoring variables is displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; view , in which all brack@@ ets , with numbers numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( as in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger everything or part of the following functionality is available .
&quot; with this action the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger , if required , or it shares the plug @-@ in with , to listen to de@@ bug requirements . this action is triggered by default if a project is opened to a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally does not have to be respected . &quot;
the counterpart to de@@ bu@@ gging session starts the session . close the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or exit the edge of the meeting .
send a HTTP request to the server for a transfer request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to look at the current document . the output of this requirement is shown in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue .
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to begin with the execution of the script and updated information on the monitoring variables as well as the current specified line . if this happens when the script started , the execution starts again before a debit request was started , the script will start with the requirement . &quot;
&quot; indicates the de@@ bu@@ gger to start with the execution of the script , without information to monitor variables and the current pointer number . if this happens when a script is made , the execution starts before a debit request begins , the execution starts when a requirement is placed . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next assignment in the script , without having to enter the functions or includes . &quot;
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger performs the next assignment in the script , whereby if possible in functions and includes an error . &quot;
&quot; when de@@ bu@@ gger shows the de@@ bu@@ gger , to move the instruction and go to the next one , as if there were the current one . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the supervised value appears in the variable view . &quot;
with this dialog variable you can add a variable or set a new value of a variable .

&quot; this chapter describes how you can adapt &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; to adapt to your needs , and how you can get &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; helping to get better . &quot;
&quot; document type Edi@@ ting packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS . you allow &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; skills like car ease and IDE ; a quick , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web@@ developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s are available in two types , family 1 , the Mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script and tool@@ box . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two parts , the tag folder and tool@@ ing . tag files contain hand @-@ oriented Le@@ aders of images ( above the Edi@@ tier window ) , which insert text and instructions faster into a document than a user ever could . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be compiled manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically generated from an existing D@@ T@@ D . see for details for conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how to create XML files , then the &amp; Bas@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool @-@ tools . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and content of the Fe@@ atur@@ es@@ cop@@ c , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ c ; file includes the rules and information of &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . they offer quick inser@@ ting tags in a document without any risk of writing . &quot;
tag @-@ folders are nothing but folder . you only contain the &amp; Bas@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the Tag@@ XML files . tag files contain the name of the descri@@ bable language and version . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of the day XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible to give other users a better understanding and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following section describes each element in detail . everything about possibilities and limits is set forth in simple ways .
&quot; this is the root element of a day XML document . it can occur only once in a document , but it can contain the definition of many tags , but it does not contain just one element type over itself . &quot;
the type of tags is a script function . when using it &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of function . ( only family 2 )
only for the day type class is valid . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the type meth@@ od . returns the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the day has a particular attribute of the attribute and the attributes within this tags can be added to each other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; -@@ day . this is an only element type item .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tags . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it defines the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains other tags to describe how this attribute shall be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an only element type item . &quot;
&quot; returns source texts for the attributes used in the tag @-@ Edi@@ ting dialog , and in the attribute tree &quot;
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; is used for achievement of source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; is used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a cutting and a methodology name . the arguments that are handed over to the method . can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tags . &quot;
a container @-@ day conver@@ ts the elements of a list together . it can occur for a attribute only once . it is a only @-@ element element .
sets the position of the attribute within a dialogue . this day can occur for every attribute in a dialogue only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; -@@ day ) . the element is empty .
specify the position and size of a field in dialogue . this day should be available for each field in dialogue ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; Labels &gt; Day ) . this element is empty .
&quot; there is a list of elements that may occur within the specified tags . this element is an only element type . &quot;
specify a list of elements that end a day . this element is an only element type .
all equ@@ ino@@ XML files must begin with a &amp; XML ; -@@ declaration begin : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 En@@ co@@ ding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be gre@@ ased and closed properly .
space do affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; mark . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; Tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and &amp; lt ; text &gt; replaces well , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to verify the Tag@@ XML files , the tools dialogue at the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ Win@@ dow to start and check @-@ up tag@@ X@@ ML@@ A . another dialogue will appear to follow its simple instructions . &quot;
&quot; this function is currently not available . at present , the testing is only at the store of the Tag@@ XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W@@ 3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; diagram . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; in the following example , for a working family 2 tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the file name of this tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; day &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; &quot; string &quot; &quot; = &quot; string &quot; status = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Bas@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor that can be processed via D@@ T@@ D Bear@@ be@@ ite D@@ T@@ D settings ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , should be prepared for a new &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , using the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = D@@ T@@ D _ / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) nickname = The simplified name of D@@ T@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not stated , the name is used as a nickname . &quot;
an action can set up with settings actions ... created . click on new action to the same dialog :
this action pre@@ defined keyboard short@@ cut . with clicking the button user interface can be assigned to a keyboard short@@ cut ; using one is the current ke@@ ystro@@ kes is remot@@ ely .
the simplest actions can be entered in the det@@ ectable settings and when exec@@ uting the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action you can change external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or write as input ( or parts of the document ) . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; themselves are the quick start @-@ dialog or the various refer in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
&quot; first , the name of the script and the interpre@@ ter has to be indicated . example : S@@ H / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh . &quot;
&quot; although qualified paths are allowed , it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ ting you variable in the command line : global scripts : $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Scrip@@ ts in their path : $ path There are other special vari@@ able that can be used in the command line : &quot;
&quot; % f : we replaced with the URL of the current document . in the case of a local document file , file : / from the document name . &quot;
&quot; % pi@@ d : is replaced with the P@@ ID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; only one instance runs , the text belongs to the P@@ ID number . this is useful when D@@ COP to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script is used . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or the path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the above mentioned methods , a script can be sent by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ore ; on the standard input can be determined . in the drop @-@ field input can be determined , which is to send to standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
chosen text : the selected area of the document will be sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only accessible with this setting .
&quot; according to the input , the output of the implemented application can be diver@@ ted . there are two types of output written : normal output , written on the default output . it can be stated , which will be done with the text written on the default output . &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the Mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in a given case it is not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ ups . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the new action button at the bottom of the window will start editing mode .
fill in all the required fields and add the day to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the day attributes has attributes , and you plan your use , enable you to edit dialog &quot; tag , &quot; if available , so that a input when using the action is possible . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this a ugly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? do we replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; choose from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , graphic other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixels , we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all the other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . &quot;
&quot; with regard to that the day starts , I decided to create a laun@@ cher as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually interpreted as loose , rigi@@ dly , further interpreted ) , or should at least , a message to the user be sign@@ aled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ ling ; -@@ day in the current document will insert . &quot;
&quot; after the creation of the symbol , it must still be connected to the action . this happens over the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selection of the desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the application button and continue with other tags , so there are still , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
&quot; suppose you want to add some usual &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar , or it should adjust this to better overview by some separ@@ ators in multiple groups . open the tool@@ bar to set up dialog on settings tool@@ bar . make sure the required tool@@ bar is selected . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the element , I want to choose the separ@@ ator ( at the left ) for my tool@@ bar . after selecting the element , which is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to add a quick way to access the Con@@ quer@@ or Pre@@ view . I will select it and add the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; please note , as the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who doesn &apos;t know my tool@@ bar , could believe that the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button the opposite of the start @-@ button . &quot;
&quot; the new tool@@ bar must be tested by pro@@ b of all symbols , to make sure everything works . &quot;
&quot; back to the right folder . after re@@ XML does not exist , it will be stored in the right folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the right folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) if a file is opened from the appropriate type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users the possibility to add documentation to the scrip@@ ting language or the form@@ ative language you like most . therefore , this chapter explains how I set a &amp; PHP ; -@@ document tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before you start your own documentation , you might check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ repository , if anyone has done this for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to search an existing documentation for form@@ atting / script / etc ; language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . the first part we let you cover here . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation section 1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Section 2 = # Sec@@ 2.1 , # Sec@@ 2.2 , # Sec@@ 2.3 Sec@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.0 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ 2.1 = Sec@@
the tree tree defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentary tree . for example you can see it now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation something like this :
# K@@ DE Con@@ fig File &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element Top element = PHP 4.2 Co@@ ordin@@ ates = In@@ tro@@ duction = In@@ tro@@ duction = = In@@ tro@@ duction = = In@@ tro@@ duction = Pharmac@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Electri@@ tion@@ .@@ html ... Language Re@@ ference = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
notice the # before Get@@ ting Start@@ ed and Language Re@@ ference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the chess problems ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
note that the contents of the index is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and consequ@@ ent in the upper end of the Pre@@ view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is displayed ! ) .
space do not affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; and &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; resource types will be replaced .
&quot; the content of the section is the area of do@@ cr@@ c file which is to be displayed for the context of a text @-@ context @-@ sensitive help . for example , if writing a &amp; PHP ; script running the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array -@@ function . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context @-@ list ) and the file contents . &quot;
a simple list of sub@@ ist@@ ently separated context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
&quot; now you can save your file do@@ cr@@ c simply save it according to $ HO@@ ME / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / doc / qu@@ anta / doc for local or global use . then create a folder ( as stated in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there . &quot;
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worth to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , e.g. which documentation have been used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ Community . they will not be rich , but proud to have worked on the best web platform . &quot;
&quot; you are not alone . it is possible to share the leaves resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ ing with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent via e @-@ mail to friends , partners or anywhere else . at different places there is an email to send menu entry , like D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D ) with email , tool tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in templates and in scripts . &quot;
&quot; resources can be up@@ loaded into our main archive , from where all the other &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eness ; -@@ users can download it . the contributions will be checked and only available when our team needs them as accurate and useless for publishing . thus , the origin of resources is assured , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is needed for their private GP@@ G keys ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the case that you have multiple keys , you may be able to search a look . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL query can remain empty ) and with clicking on OK the upload will be started . &quot;
&quot; upload can upload from the D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D D@@ T@@ D @-@ package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , tool tool@@ bar to upload , and in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installing , examined &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by examining the integrity and signature . if the integrity is given and the resource is correctly signed , a message appears with the declaration of the origin@@ ator of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML @-@ languages , which is currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; it can be time @-@ consuming , because hundreds of tag files in a day XML format might be necessary . there is the simplest way to convert a D@@ T@@ D to a D@@ TE@@ P package . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the D@@ T@@ D shop and Conver@@ ting of a D@@ T@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the D@@ T@@ D description , which is to be used . after that , the following dialogue will appear : &quot;
target directory : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE definition file : the string that appear in the ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE day like HTML public - / / W@@ 3@@ C / / D@@ T@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN htt@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / ht@@ m@@ l@@ 4 / loo@@ se@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine setting of D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; according to the transformation of the &amp; D p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; -@@ Editor , with the details of newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P . it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ore , there are some key concepts . to understand and get full advantage of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; so this chapter tries to bring them closely with these fundament@@ als . this chapter tries to bring them closely with these fundamental concepts , without their understanding &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; little benefits . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ore , the working area divided into three areas : global , locally and project @-@ related . this distinction affects a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , use , available . tool@@ ing about actions is all that is marked as global , in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this enables the group of administrators different tool @-@ making , actions and patterns in a global tree , which will then be available to anyone in a multi @-@ user environment at the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of Web developers for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ ing . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be everything from &amp; CSS . -@@ patterns up to tool@@ ing with special actions specifically for the files of a specific project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all the elements are set out in the folder @-@ tree of the project which is the sharing of special tools and patterns of all the staff within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of some major areas : the editing window , the building views , the cart@@ es with information and tool@@ ing . please beat in , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click the card @-@ leader with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document password , re@@ charge , delete , delete or upload the document , jump to a book@@ mark or execution of CV@@ S commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area lead to another context menu with regard to the edited document , such as basic mach@@ ining steps ( cut / paste / paste ) to edit the word under the mouse @-@ cursor or opening the file , if the string is referred to under the mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editing pane , the tool@@ ing of the editor is at present . at present &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional as standard to which a set of tool tools are shown . in the course of further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens , the tool@@ bar will be adapted to the new functions and the associated user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ making is really easy . if you want to insert a single day , for example , &amp; lt ; in their document you want to insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the building views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow it to get information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; to navigate , to open and stri@@ pe it . in the presentation with cardboard boxes stand for files , project , sample templates , documentation , scripts , attributes , and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that puts &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , prepared . this view displays all the files in the project and permits the administrator of the files in the project through right mouse click . actions like adding , removal , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from storage media can be carried out in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc ; There are all options open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only for the respective users and templates in projects are available only in the project . more to templates is available . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scripts in the Global , Local and Project here . by clicking with the left mouse button you can retrieve the available information about a script . via the right mouse button , additional functions are available , such as the script to boot , edit or send with e @-@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with this view , one shows the internal structure of the active document . by left clicking a module , the cursor in the document is set to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking of the element it opens a list of commands regarding navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
&quot; this tree will appear under the other building views . with it , man@@ ner@@ ed attributes and nam@@ esp@@ ace can change . the target @-@ out application system allows the change of all available attributes with just a few clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation on the Web technology for your development . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ eness ; &apos; documentation site can be downloaded , and by adding a folder doc to a project , project @-@ specific documentation can be added and viewed . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult : two cart@@ on at the bottom of the window , which can be reached using beneficial information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this mark@@ er shows information about each in Qu@@ anta ongoing script , such as the D@@ T@@ D , the current document used , and all changes to the D@@ T@@ D . &quot;
&quot; this cart@@ on shows all the mistakes in the market up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul , scripts that are executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tools are comprehen@@ sively extended and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they get the corresponding command screen . the chocolate side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility of defining their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail ; sends the tool@@ bar as a zi@@ pped T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they get a tool@@ bar in an email , they can get them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ edness ; like any other secure and load ! &quot;
it is reasonable if you want to adapt the place of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort ; files on your system want to be handed over to your system . to get a complete list of options that can be transferred to the configure script . to understand a complete list of all options that are easy to understand . / configure --@@ help . the options are simple to understand and do not run here .
&quot; if you have problems when starting from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ell , you should check whether your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . you should also make sure that &apos;s no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the path in front of their bin folder . the same applies to &amp; Q@@ t . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a Web @-@ development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; was optimized for a rapid Web @-@ development and combines a well @-@ thought development environment with a multitude of powerful functions .
&quot; during the endeavor to create the best &amp; HTML ; -@@ Editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ore began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult : a strange , exten@@ sible Mark@@ up languages editor would be ? well , this would make him absolutely greatest web @-@ development tools for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; limited to pure &amp; HTML , limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now far on the path to a general and comprehensive Web @-@ development tool . together , you can define it in &amp; XML ; then should &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE should be . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product on the outstanding efforts of the whole &amp; k@@ de ; Desig@@ ners , follows , in good application of free software , the idea of Why developing it ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; smells is not only this all possible , but it allows users and developers , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult , so to expand how they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; enable Web developers to increase the use of an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can extend the productivity dramatically . by means of self @-@ coated actions , scripts and tool@@ ing , autom@@ ating can expand almost every task . by the program Kom@@ alizing they can expand &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ( more about it can be found in . ) &quot;
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment designed for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and was quickly developed to a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GPL licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more into the details of the documentation is with help : / qu@@ anta ( either this URL to &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; type , or help@@ des@@ center help : / qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ anta , is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ able sequ@@ it@@ ur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; quick access list of files that you have opened . this list changes every time you open a file , which is not located , whereby the oldest entry is taken out . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to store code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the section on templates . should they try to store the selected file / text outside the local / project sub@@ folder , only a bug has been reported . &quot;
conver@@ ts when inser@@ ting from the cli@@ p@@ board there with special characters to &amp; HTML ; -@@ notes so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as form@@ atting instructions .
conver@@ ts the text from the cli@@ p@@ board in &amp; URL ; -@@ write which is the correct way to inser@@ ting special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s first and foremost to inser@@ ting &amp; URL ; s into the anchor day .
&quot; unlock the block selection and select , which allows you to select text blocks using the help of &amp; Shift . &quot;
go directly to a line number . that &apos;s very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; -@@ script error messages are out !
looks for a string or regular printing in the selected directory . a type of gre@@ p or sed with the GUI and pre@@ defined words to help you .
displays the news window or not . that &apos;s the window in which you see the display of scrip@@ tions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; turn @-@ off of problem @-@ re@@ porters at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as one changes to the structure tree . &quot;
&quot; displays the tool@@ bar left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click . &quot;
&quot; if you read book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu with the entries of previous or neighbour , depending on the position of the cursor in the document . &quot;
book@@ mark from other opened documents will be group@@ ed in the menu according to the file name of the other documents .
open an existing project from the hard disk . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; projects are stored with the file .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied into the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory to new files which could be there . that allows , for example graphics files in your project folder , or sub@@ folders and then add it to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server high . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further inputs / output modules ( K@@ IO Sl@@ aves ) .
&quot; attitudes , how &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; the project is managed . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult , -@@ projects you will find the details . &quot;
&quot; loads a project tool@@ bar . these are kept in project you / tool@@ bars , and are only in this menu , if you have assigned it to this project . &quot;
&quot; a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be set up via tool@@ bar tool@@ ing , or you are asked to save whether you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; remove a tool@@ bar from the field of view . it does not delete it from disk . if you have not saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do this . &quot;
&quot; with this , you can send their own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; -@@ team , so that the tool@@ bar is available in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as an attachment . &quot;
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ ing to the main server , where everyone can access it . see in . &quot;
download a &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; you or anyone else did someone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own descri@@ p@@ ation format .
&quot; refresh / refresh the entities out of the &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; it &apos;s useful when the entities came out of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P , without renew the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this global is and a typ@@ ing in the global K@@ DE folder is not available , fails the store . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags , which are currently charged in the currently charged tool@@ bar . if the standard is loaded ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar , there are a sub @-@ menu standard that contains the list of tags / promotions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current day setup dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the menu tags , followed by &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; activated or disable the intelligent inser@@ tion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ T@@ Ds . intelligent inser@@ ting means that &amp; intolerance are denied by using tool@@ bar when this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plug @-@ in menu , the available plugins are listed among the above @-@ mentioned menu points . click them activated . clicked on a activated plug @-@ ins de@@ activated . &quot;
select the syn@@ dro@@ pping mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schem@@ ata depends on der@@ k@@ ate ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of character identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people , the other OS platforms to the developer . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document on the basis of the selected &amp; D@@ T@@ D ; by means of the external application .
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching mode can sometimes need or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the card mode , which is also the default setting , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ Saul ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open sub@@ window . with selection of a inser@@ tion , the corresponding sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
divi@@ des the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; the changes in this dialog influences every application that use the K@@ HTML @-@ Part , including the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
judge the behavior of the editors . in the documentation of &amp; K@@ ate ; you can find details .
&quot; a dialog appears , in which you can delete entries from the tool@@ box , or which add or change the sequences . &quot;
&quot; this should produce a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any Open Source project the developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; development in financial form , they find here the way . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be filled in the best from top to bottom , as for example after filling out the project name the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be set later with Shift ; F@@ 7 project project properties are set . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to include , for example fo@@ o . when entering this file , file will be automatically filled . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in small letters and without space with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can access the server address of the machine to which one wants to access , unless you can edit local data . either a Name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ samples .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the settings of the remote computer , an adaptation could be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bar can be stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and standard tool@@ bar . if a common collection of files is used for various projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to include files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . you can select multiple files or whole folder .
&quot; this attitude is great if you have static web content , you need to download and change . with ser@@ et@@ fed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to go differently . &quot;
&quot; if files are displayed somewhere in the main folder of the project , if a project is started anew , not an@@ ha@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders inside the main button are displayed and you can make an exact choice according to the owner . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the main folder . you can select the desired files by quotes , or remove them from the project . &quot;
&quot; the last screen of the new project assistants contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be up@@ loaded in the menu with project project properties in the sub@@ window , or using the short@@ cut Shift key ; F@@ 7 changed . &quot;
some settings correspond to those in the project assistants and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( plac@@ eholder is possible ) , which can be re @-@ read with project @-@ related operations like the project folder . &quot;
&quot; complementary option to top , even files that are listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project review , which will be loaded when opening the project . in addition , more about project views can be read . &quot;
&quot; thus , the desired de@@ bu@@ gger can be selected . currently only Gub@@ ed is supported . more information about Gub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger Plugin can be set with the button options . in case , the troubles@@ hooting procedure is described . &quot;
&quot; upload profiles can be set in the sub@@ window profiles ( see in ) , as well as the display of a building view for the content of the server for each profile , adding an own building view to each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window of events , you can switch to event actions and add these actions , change or delete it . events are executed when a prior event occurs , such as the si@@ ps of a file . see in the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens is opened ; the last project , which was opened . this behavior can currently not be influenced . &quot;
to open another project select project ... from the menu project or the symbol project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult is closed , the project file will automatically be saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files occurs . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
project management gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folder can be found , however , the entries are open and open with ... in the right @-@ click context menu : &quot;
here you can select different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the up@@ loaded files . see below .
&quot; allows the removal of the current profile . if only a profile exists , the button will be distr@@ acted to prevent the removal . &quot;
the password will be kept in the core memory and forget the program . this possibility is useful when frequent up@@ loading files is needed and the rather safe password stored on the record option does not come into question .
&quot; this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialog , if you change your mind before the up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high la@@ la@@ de@@ profiles can be up@@ loaded and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be up@@ loaded to different servers . in editing or creating a profile this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the name of the server to which the files are to be copied . either a fully qualified Dom@@ a@@ inn@@ ame or IP address work .
the transfer protocol for the up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed K@@ IO Sl@@ aves . at least you should choose from &amp; FTP ; one file ( local ) and NFS .
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed unless the network administrator operates a service not on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be easily read , but each with programming knowledge can easily be seen in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a projection view is only a set of files and tool@@ bar . it can be used in a project a lot of views , i.e. due to simple exchange of view , various files and tool@@ bar can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; views can be stored in the menu project or project tool@@ bar , accessible via settings tool@@ ing project tool@@ bar , open or deleted . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ort , with which one has the most to do . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ iens ; to its own way of working . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ making in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; best regarding the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . use and adding is different . adding tool@@ ing is treated below in the section Add of tool@@ ing .
&quot; the tool@@ bar and symbols can be set either by means of the context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which new action tool@@ bar can be executed , tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in dialogue , where actions on this or other tool@@ bar can be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( symbol ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and instruc@@ ted action that are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ ing and the actions on them can set up in the menu with settings tools to set up ... and define settings . set .
&quot; templates are in the essential document skel@@ et@@ ons , code @-@ cut@@ lets and files for link@@ ages . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used models in principle such as a nasty fil@@ esystem with exten@@ sible organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or modify any existing folder in the template tree ; templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in about the restrictions you specify for the fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ ult , provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each template , before using exactly . &quot;
&quot; binary is all that is not pure text . it can be added any file except text , so images , &amp; PDF ; s , Flash files &amp; etc . binary templates are usually included in documents using code templates ( e.g. images with IM@@ G sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the templates tree is available . &quot;
documents can be written by any text type . on the basis of these templates will be compiled new documents . usually a simple rum@@ st for the purpose and organizes the work in appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the templates tree .
this type of templates is useful if not a new document based on a template but the same text field is always included in the documents . you can find everything from one comment to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basis . some examples are found in the template tree under global templates . see for more information about the templates tree .
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for entire websites as templates . they are a collection of different documents that can be organized in a folder structure . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &quot;
&quot; design a document structure after expos@@ ing ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc . ) and select file when storing a local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , you notice that ( even if it has been stored as a project reserve ) the template is not visible in the project tree . take a look at the presentation tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File to save it as a local / project reserve . alternatively , the selection can be drawn with dra@@ gging and deduc@@ ed on the building view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be used in a sub@@ folder folder , so it can be used for file management functions , such as pulling and inser@@ ting or inser@@ ting over the file tree of con@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click in the file tree or in the project files building view to a folder on the right and secure site template , secured a name for the template , but of course it can be stored in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as local or global template . &quot;
project requirements allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can insert head@@ lines and foot@@ er @-@ lines or dynam@@ ically with &amp; PHP ; create files insert or link with them . additionally you can keep some things in mind when using templates in projects very profound .
the pre @-@ structure structure in the sub@@ window is based on the files stored in $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / apps / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates / qu@@ anta / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / Templ@@ ates / Templ@@ ates / templates / templates
&quot; to set the behaviour of a folder , click on the folder to click the folder and select in the context menu tab . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . this selection is distr@@ acted as soon as El@@ ter@@ ous attributes is dro@@ wned . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default , and fits all except for the head@@ board in the imagination . if a regular folder would have basically been activated , unless they would be explicitly activated . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text @-@ stone . if nothing appears , one is probably in a regular folder . &quot;
&quot; allowed or provided text for templates in this folder , which could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ er for all templates for a specific project and allows for copying contents into a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers to equi@@ p a whole presentation already with the matching head@@ lines / foot@@ er lines . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( showing the right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copy and paste templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source editor that passes over the menu view . the first mode replaces the Editor window into two parts : the editor @-@ editor and the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor .
the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor works as follows : he loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; -@@ page and a cursor . then you can edit and on demand for the source code editor used in which the changes made in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor in the source code are visible .
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document , the &amp; PHP ; it &apos;s not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit this directly with the V@@ PL ; editor to edit &amp; PHP ; no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously changes both in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor will be enabled and the cursor is active in the source code editor and in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor synchron@@ ized with the cursor to the active cursor from one window to another , while the position is maintained in the document . &quot;
the sync position between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the code editor is adjustable using settings Qu@@ anta up .... After selecting V@@ PL ; -@@ View you can choose between synchron@@ isation after a click or automatically . in the selection automatically the time span can additionally be adjusted . basically the recommendation is set : a small span@@ ne for fast calcul@@ ators and a great span@@ ne for slow .
&quot; suppose you want to change the title of the website , the tools of documentation is possible to choose from . thus , the editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor is also called once a new document is created with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor . this is intended to change the above code using the V@@ PL ; this means that it is possible to change the following : &quot;
met@@ a @-@ tags allow the storage of information about the document itself e.g. : keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below . one click into the list allows the change of content , e.g. key words on the column name and key@@ word key@@ word 1 on the page column . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way to design the look of pages in the browser . you can add CSS @-@ rules with the buttons under the list or delete . a change over the list is possible exactly as with the met@@ a elements . the editing of CSS @-@ rules is currently not supported .
&quot; it is possible to bind an external CSS @-@ style device by pressing on the file @-@ open button , and select the appropriate file . &quot;
&quot; the use of the C@@ urs@@ ors is like in a text processing , through moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor is like usual . text can be inserted through one type and by means of re@@ tool@@ bar or del@@ ectable . &quot;
&quot; insert tags will be done in the same way via tool@@ ing , as planned in the source code editor , e.g. if an anchor tag is inserted by text , such as an anchor day , surrounded by text , everyone must be around the anchor drops . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ ing such as the modem assistant or the lists @-@ assistant are disabled . they will be later in &amp; V@@ PL ; they will be used later in the &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ ing must be used . &quot;

there are many graphic tools for the comparisons . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the compilation was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had done many changes while at the same time had corrected many places . another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file , and the result was numerous conflicts . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I wasn &apos;t able to see what exactly changed inside these lines . and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the control had changed . that &apos;s the result of these changes was a little nightmare . &quot;
so that was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters . later on a lot more useful features were added .
&quot; if you want to compare text quickly , just copy it to the cli@@ p@@ board and add it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and result of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
also 3 @-@ way merge is fully supported . this is useful when two people are working independently of one piece co@@ de and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps detect conflict and simultaneously displays the expected results . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the scre@@ enshot shows three Qu@@ ell files in the result :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you with the comparisons and merge complete folder . this scre@@ enshot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; in case of the folder :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and serve with the possibilities of current color monitors . if you need to check co@@ de , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are visible . if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no trouble , if someone changes the back@@ pack . ) &quot;
&quot; when a file is equal , and the other differs in a line , then the color indicate which file is different . red color means both files differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but in different folders , you can ease yourself using the file @-@ work by using only the fil@@ en@@ ames of the first file . example : &quot;
diff@@ rent 3 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2 Ord@@ re 2
&quot; open dialog allows the manual type of fil@@ en@@ ames , the selection of the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the box . you do not have to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files will be performed . &quot;
&quot; using the button folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the comparisons of the file will be selected , for B and C , however , a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A into the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merged , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately . you can do this step later with saving . &quot;
the inser@@ tion button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting with the comparisons .
&quot; sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to select text parts from the cli@@ p@@ board into the active comparison window . the comparison begins immediately . open @-@ dialog you need to select no files , you can simply shut the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag pulling off and insert : simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor , and let it fall over a comparison window . &quot;
&quot; which idea is behind it ? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar features . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively large effort . you would only need to create two corresponding files , they are in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; download and then compare them . now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy , insert and then compare . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot draw anything out of &amp; diff@@ 3 ; only the fall of text in a comparative window is supported . &quot;
&quot; warning : some editors interpret the drop and drop of text into another program than cutting and insert ( instead of copying and inser@@ ting ) . in such a case , your original data might be lost . &quot;
&quot; in the upper part of each text window is the info line . the info @-@ line of the source window contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the pointer number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) E@@ de Info row has different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , the mouse can rest a while on the line . then a small help window will display the full name . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source code is the letters A , B and C assigned . a has the color blue , B the color green and C is mag@@ enta . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is recognized , one looks at the color that file is different . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files . this is in the next section ( bring together ) well . &quot;
&quot; links next to the text is the Com@@ prehen@@ sive column . when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages , the color is curved , only the relevant changes are not so important , it is useful to only see the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + for example , white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for pre@@ processor and in few , rare items . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line that separates the Com@@ prehen@@ sive column from the text , is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the cursor is activated , the line on the broken lines is dot@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( among the script above ) has also a info line with the ins@@ cription issue : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; change &#93; if you have processed the result . usually it contains automatically generated by the automatic , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are dissolved , the store is disabled ! ! ! ( use the buttons jump to next st@@ low dissolved / un@@ resolved conflict in order to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference must also be resolved at the same time a conflict of manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in one of the windows , the first line of the group is marked in all windows and the first line of the group is displayed . ( this will also be a leap of the position in the windows , where the top of the group would otherwise not be visible . ) This group will be highlighted in the current area with the color background for current area , and each on the left appears a black beam . &quot;
sometimes left by the automatic merge or run by manual editing no further line more in the group ; then in these lines the text is displayed ; No line in the file is displayed ; no line in the file is displayed ; this text does not appear in the final file , nor in a mark@@ er that you might copy and insert them somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; compilation of conflic@@ table ; however , appears in the cli@@ p@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . go carefully with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : if selecting the sources to ignore the options , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly navig@@ ating with the images and mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you are using one of the windows , you can use the arrow buttons left , right , end , str@@ g @-@ start and str@@ g end , Si@@ w as you can also use it from other programs . you can also click the buttons to navigate . &quot;
&quot; in the Aug@@ mentation window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the inser@@ ting button , you can switch between inser@@ tion and trans@@ cription mode . ( pre @-@ set is the inser@@ tion mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the list columns syn@@ ced the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained already in the section and explained the edi@@ table window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict ( Str@@ g @-@ picture down@@ ward ) or to the next / previous conflict , continue to resolve as a conflict . therefore , there must be distinction between resolved and un@@ resolved conflicts . &quot;
&quot; to copy the mark@@ er into the cli@@ p@@ board , you must automatically copy the Copy button ( Str@@ g @-@ C or Str@@ g @-@ inser@@ ting ) . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , automatically exp@@ ire into the cli@@ p@@ board and manually copy the manual copy . be careful with this option but you could accidentally over@@ write the contents of the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
&quot; foref@@ athers are stored in accordance with the corresponding operating system . Unix flavors use a pointer type signal \ , and Win@@ 32 @-@ based systems use Wagen@@ re + pointer type \ \ r \ . K@@ fam@@ 3 keeps the hands @-@ out of the source files , therefore you should use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also do not use binary files . &quot;
the options and the list of the last used files will be automatically saved and restored during the next start . ( menu Reg@@ istered - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems the dialog also sets scripts with variable width to choose from , you should not use it . ) &quot;
&quot; if you activate this option , differences are shown in cur@@ sive script . if the chosen font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in its pure form but would be drawn straight . on these systems the button @-@ settings automatically displays an un@@ just color . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the tick @-@ button button is inserted the corresponding number of spaces . otherwise , a sp@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when entering or return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; if this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . the manual copy is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . &quot;
you can select which pointer type you prefer to store . the proposed value is the generally common selection on the used operating system .
&quot; in the case of files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; first , all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white characters can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es every line . in this step white characters will not be ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) store a car @-@ run &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a pointer type &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , but then they could be different with different sizes in the side @-@ on @-@ side comparison , however , as a white character is visible . during this option , this option must be de@@ activated . in default this option is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting this option is de@@ activated . in the first part of the analysis , numbers and related signs ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) . in the result the differences are nevertheless displayed , but they are treated as white signs . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated as changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; looking for even smaller differences . the option is activated in default . it &apos;s effective with complicated and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in the Autom@@ atically rout@@ ing mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ resolved conflict will continue . &quot;
&quot; automatically sol@@ ves all conflicts in white characters used by the chosen file as a source . ( default is manual choice . ) This is useful when white signs are less important in many files . if you only do it from time to time , then use better the features of voting A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the compile menu . note that the Autom@@ atic selection may also ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are dealt with in the chapter to scan and run a compilation . look for details under documentation to the directory comparison and compilation .
&quot; when a file is stored and already an older version exists , then the original version is attached to the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a back@@ up@@ file exists with the Su@@ ff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; the language of user interface fits . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to quit , finish and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is set in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available , because the language is set to global control over the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following enco@@ ding settings can be adjusted for each entry separately . if this option is enabled , the top settings will be used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the selection fields for the enco@@ ding appears a short reference , which is the local co@@ ding . ( this cannot be changed here and has for you purely informal character . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file enco@@ ding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpre@@ ters . since the enco@@ ding is individually adjustable for each file , even files can be compared and merged with different enco@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which co@@ ding to store will be used . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre @-@ processing commands , you might not work with your co@@ dec ( for example , your files may be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ editor command can only handle 8 @-@ bit AS@@ C@@ II . ) With this option one can specify the enco@@ ding of the output of pre @-@ processing commands . &quot;
&quot; turn this off to sup@@ press the high@@ lighting changes in white signs in the text or review . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments , if the options are numbers , ignore or ignore C / C + + comments . ) &quot;
&quot; this selection is only available when you compare three files . in normal mode , all the differences between two of three files will be displayed . but sometimes you might just want to see the differences between two of three files . according to choose from A &amp; lt ; -@@ ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ ; C or B &amp; lt ; -@@ ; C or B &amp; b ; -@@ ; C , besides the normal still a second over@@ sight column are displayed with the information required . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the space available on the screen for long lines . just hit the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu ) .
&quot; orders the comparison window by side to each other . this can also be useful to display long lines . ( this option is in the window menu ) . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then opt out suddenly , merge the files together . a simple click starts the compilation and uses the file name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart it , then the name of the last used output file will be maintained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is transferred to this external command . in &amp; box 3 , then the output of the command will be visible , and not the file itself . you can use your own pre@@ processor that corresponds exactly to your needs . you can use this feature for example , to remove bot@@ tom@@ atic parts or to correct the command . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file it is given to this external command ( see above ) , then the output of the command is specified under the line command . you can write your own pre@@ processor , which corresponds exactly to your needs . each input line must have an associated output line . &quot;
&quot; the thought behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . but for this , an external program requires , and most users do not want to program himself . the good news is , however , that in most cases sed or per@@ l absolutely suff@@ ice . &quot;
use this pre @-@ editor command to convert into large letters : sed &apos;s / \ \ ( . * \ \ ) / \ \ U \ \ 1 / &apos; This is a erg@@ ul@@ ary expression of the missing text in the first gear string . the \ \ U conver@@ ts the found text in upper case letters .
CV@@ S and other version control systems use some keywords to add device chains ( info : / CV@@ S / key@@ word sub@@ stitutes ) . * \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; while you experiment with sed , you may start to understand it and maybe you like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
&quot; the Ign@@ ore of numbers is actually a already built @-@ in function in K@@ fam@@ 3 . however , it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for po@@ len@@ ght . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and every hit is replaced by nothing , so virtually deleted . &quot;
sometimes you might want to perform several re@@ alizations at a time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions of each other . example :
&quot; instead , sed you can also use something other such as per@@ l use@@ .@@ per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / RE@@ GE@@ XP / replacement / switches &apos; However , per@@ l needs \ \ ( and \ \ ) , per@@ l needs only ( and ) without the provided &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
&quot; the data is maintained following the normal pre @-@ processor , for the display and for the display . further operations only change the data collected by the line @-@ off @-@ al@@ gor@@ y@@ th@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases if you use a normal pre @-@ processor , the pointer is the output of the normal pre @-@ processor output as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ fabri@@ cation commands are very useful , but as in any function , the text changes or differences hidden , you cannot notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often , programmers need to edit many files in one folder . for this reason , you can compare with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folder recur@@ sively compare and merge . &quot;
... &quot; make a suggestion for each object , you can adjust the proposal before the start , &quot;
... can simul@@ ate this simul@@ ate and displays the simul@@ ated changes without really perform them
... &quot; select selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is similar to the comparison and merge from individual files very similar . you just need to specify folders on the command line or in dialog file .
&quot; if three folder is assembled , the folder 1 is used as a base . if no target folder has been specified , used &amp; box 3 , folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison from folders automatically starts , do not match it . to launch this , you need to select the appropriate menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details follow . ) &quot;
&quot; during the reading of the folder , you will receive a small message window above the current progress . if you rip scanning the folder , only the files are listed until then . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is finished , shows &amp; che@@ eses 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and each folder found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded . you can double the folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by clicking the arrow buttons for left / right . the directory menu contains two functions all sub@@ directories , and all sub@@ directories can set up with which you can access all the folders or folders . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ click on a file , the file will be started automatically and it appears a comparison window . &quot;
the icon in the column name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the contrac@@ tion of this action can not be automatically elected . if that collap@@ sed , you will be informed about the problems of this kind . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the above picture , a B / B / C columns are used in red , green , yellow , and black . &quot;
&quot; however , the colour is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
&quot; folders are considered to be identical if its entire content is identical . then , also folders the same color . in folders , the age is irrelevant for its color . &quot;
&quot; the idea for this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ aut . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf@@ y , which is only green , then yellow will be and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; A and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy of C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy of A ( or if a does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , that may not collapse . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A folder and B is a file ) : error : contradic@@ tory file types . as long as such faul@@ ty objects exist , that may not collapse . &quot;
&quot; the mode to synchron@@ ize is active , if only two folders and no explicit target folder was specified and if the option directories are active , then select &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the necessary action so that both files are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and store the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; directly after the file copied &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B after A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged , then selecting the new file instead of selecting ( uns@@ afe ) then examined &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of files and suggests the newer file to copying . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. If such errors are not eliminated , the folder can not be started . &quot;
&quot; during the collapse a file will be processed after the other . it &apos;s Status column shows off , if it was successful , and according to other messages when something goes out , you should make a final review and check whether the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in order dialog is selected the file @-@ method of full analysis , K@@ diff@@ 3 will display further columns . these contain the number of un@@ le@@ aks , sol@@ dered , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for solved conflict is only displayed when three files are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either bring the straight selected entry ( File or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries will be chosen once . if you have selected all the contrac@@ tions ( also in all sub@@ folders ) , you can bring it together . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not have a destination folder , then in the three folder mode , C is used as a goal to match the two @-@ folder B as the target and used for du@@ b@@ bing A and / or B as a destination . &quot;
&quot; if you selected a target folder , please check whether all entries are to be displayed in the target folder , even in the folder structure , there are some options to be ski@@ pped over by certain entries . check these options to avoid un@@ loving surprises : &quot;
to create all entries : choose directories / continue in the directory menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cuts ) . to execute just the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if by conflic@@ ting data types still exists invali@@ d actions , a message appears on the faul@@ ty elements appearing . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window will appear with the options to em@@ ulate and break down . &quot;
&quot; pick what you want to see if you would like to see what is going to happen without the really changes , you will receive a detailed list of all actions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual procedure is necessary ( leading a single file ) , then a composite window opens up ( note the scre@@ enshot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you are finished with a file , select once again / continue / continue / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you have not saved yet , a corresponding dialogue will appear . then performs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; his work with the next entry will continue . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a mistake , appears a message and detailed status information . at the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you choose to select the cause of the problem . if you want to lead the problem again , or solve the problematic post , before you proceed with the problem . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been created individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and performs them later . even if here that collap@@ ses or not saved , these entries are dealt with as settled . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be combined again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu settings - &gt; K@@ diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory compilation with these options :
only files which fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the elementary tree . you can add multiple patterns . separate the patterns with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; valid space card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default file must not correspond to this pattern .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree ; it can be used more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default : * .@@ o .
files and folders which correspond to this pattern are not displayed in the sub@@ tree ; it can be used more than one pattern ; use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid space card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; default : * .@@ o .
ignore files which are also ignored by CV@@ S . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CV@@ S . the great advantage is that this folder will be selected using a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( take a look at info : / CV@@ S / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore ) .
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems files , files have a publisher attribute . in other fil@@ es@@ ystems , a marked point marked a file as hidden . this option makes you decide whether these files are to be displayed in the sub@@ tree or not . this option is switched on in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; links to files : when the option is off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the files are compared to those links show . this is de@@ activated in the default setting . &quot;
&quot; when links to folder : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is switched on , the links like normal folder will be examined and recur@@ sively searches . ( note that you included a link on a link that would lead to a final loop and you cras@@ hed 3 ; ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis of each file through and displays statistics columns . ( the total analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower , when applied to files that do not contain text . ( give a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it is possible to compare only the changing date and file size . however , this speed part costs you a certain amount of security . please be careful with caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; much like familiar to the changing date . it is not a real comparison . the files are regarded as identical , if they are equal in size . for example , this can be useful for example when copying the changing date of lost . please be careful with caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; enabled the sync mode to be compared to two folders and no target folder was specified . in this mode , the suggestions are to be identical . also , the results from the merge files are stored in both folders . this option is plug@@ ged into the default setting . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead , the copying of the newer file is suggested as action . ( this is considered as uns@@ afe because it is assumed that the other file has not changed too . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; when a file or a folder will be replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be ren@@ amed , and the extension .@@ orig@@ ines already exists , so it will be deleted without further backup . that &apos;s also the normal compound of individual files , not only the sp@@ lat@@ able folder . this option is switched on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder plug @-@ in view of the combined individual files will be visible ; you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you don &apos;t want it , you can switch the window &amp; text window and switch to the window in the window and switch between directory &amp; text window between the two views . &quot;
&quot; probably you prefer to compare a file simply by double @-@ clicking menu . however , in the directory menu you can also create a corresponding menu entry . once you save the result , the status will be completed and the file will not be merged once you run the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost if you read the directory again : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparent with the help of K@@ IO @-@ Sl@@ aves . K@@ fam@@ 3 uses this for reading files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders for opening files located on local or remote machines .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with a FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a comp@@ uted archive with a local folder .
&quot; one URL has a different syntax , as local files and folders . a few things should you consider : &quot;
&quot; a path can be relatively und@@ esi@@ red or .. included . that &apos;s not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ hed . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blan@@ ket &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a brief list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it can not be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is assumed as a link destination . ( FTP : , S@@ FTP : ) . &quot;
there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification of change . hence the per@@ missions or modification date from the original . ( please note the option confidential of the size . ) ( This is only possible with local files ) .
&quot; the main purpose of the main purpose is currently as differences viewer in K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences . K@@ Dev@@ el@@ op starts first always the built @-@ in differences . to start a diff@@ user , press the right mouse button on the distinc@@ tions viewer and then select in K@@ diff@@ 3@@ Part display from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two total input files . if it is applied as a K@@ Part , the input file is a patch file in the Uni@@ fied format . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the con@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch @-@ file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ fam@@ 3@@ Part . please note that if none of the original files exists . besides , this is un@@ reliable , if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as part executed , it supports only the comparisons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . that collap@@ sed or the comparison of folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ fam@@ 2 ( now He@@ ist it comp@@ are ) are already available . besides that the name K@@ diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can result in diff@@ use 3 from the Di@@ ff @-@ Tool collection .
I use GPL @-@ programs already very long and have learnt a lot by looking at the sources of other programs . this is my thank you to all programmers who went this way or go .
&quot; if you have compiled the program from the sources and configure the configure script do not notify the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in the default setting , configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE does not locate resources for user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this subject . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters are different , these lines are first treated as identical ; if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is not identical as not identical . if these lines expect next to each other , this special is , but this is the case by the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor remembers every difference in the files where he begins and where he ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking in the source code and select the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply stored as text file and it is too much effort to design extra a file format that could save this information . &quot;
the effort for this was so far too big . you can re @-@ establish a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text should be used another editor .
&quot; after removing text is suddenly fl@@ lt up ; no sr@@ c has released , and the text does not let you delete . what does that mean and how can that be removed ? &quot;
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors for the highlight of differences . even more high@@ lighting would be confusing and mis@@ lacking the purpose . please use another editor .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; to take advantage of all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or new . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE you can find on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under htt@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ angel@@ og or in the Ch@@ angel@@ og in the Qu@@ ell package .
&quot; around &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; -@@ Distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find further details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf@@ use and autom@@ agi@@ ake , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , difficulties occur , please report on the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists of it . &quot;
cut ( C@@ tr@@ l @-@ X or Shift @-@ distance ) copies in the cli@@ p@@ board and del@@ etes the marked text . insert ( Str@@ g @-@ V or Um@@ br@@ alt @-@ inser@@ ting ) adds the text from the cli@@ p@@ board to current currency position and replaces the current marking .
&quot; only differences display : files that are identical in all folders appear not in the folder structure , and consequently not in destination folder . &quot;
( in the current version version you need to read about changes to these options the folder with the function Re@@ fresh . )
&quot; only entries are displayed , the differences are displayed . that also performs that identical files are not already copied in the target folder . if the target folder does not already contain these files , they are absent from the target folder . ( the behaviour will be switched off in a later program version . ) This option is off in default . &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to choose the source with the cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines are attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already existing ) . if the lines are already present , they will be removed immediately after clicking the button . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , this option is disabled . Under@@ cover in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated as differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ show of all virtual work surfaces . it is quite convenient to alter the current programs on working surfaces , to change their size or shift it . this works both inside a working surface and several . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ space , as well as the applications running in it . the applications can be selected and even moved to the desktop and to others . &quot;
&quot; with the middle mouse button , Windows can be moved within &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the movement is possible both inside a working surface and on other work areas . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cool@@ ed : if on the empty background of &amp; k@@ p@@ ager , cool@@ ed down , the context menu appears only the two entries P@@ ager up . if , however , the context menu and the name of the application as well as the entries minim@@ ise , maxim@@ ise , On desktop and ends . the commands effect the following : &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window on the full size of the desktop . appears only when applied to an application .
&quot; send the application to the selected virtual desktop . appears only , when applied to an application . &quot;
&quot; if this connection is marked , window can be moved inside the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; s with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to be moved to other work areas . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , become in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; the names of the virtual work surfaces are shown . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ turing this field lets the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual des@@ kt@@ ops . it is displayed together with name , the names are provided with folders , &amp; on ; 1st work surface . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each working surface is also displayed as background in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the running programs are displayed as small windows in the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; at most , only the empty spaces are displayed to allow their selection . &quot;
&quot; here , the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rect@@ angle with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the windows with its standard symbol and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real programme . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems . &quot;
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; -@@ main window will be determined : classi@@ cally lets &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ n bar , how from P@@ ager applications appear in some other windows ; wa@@ agre@@ cht shows all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops in a horizont@@ ally and vertical series , which is very good for the presentation side on the desktop . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the P@@ ager Mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be modified in size to display the windows as symbols or with its content and can also run out of control .
right mouse button inside &amp; k@@ p@@ ager ; and subsequent selection of switch sets up ... lets the dialog Settings appear .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in dialog settings . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ p@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or V@@ I. If you don &apos;t apply to any spelling for the file , you need to register as user root or log in to your system administrator . in this file you need to insert the key win@@ do@@ w@@ transpar@@ ence and indicate that one value . possible values are : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ likes ; is a screen@@ lu@@ pe . you can enlarge with &amp; like ; a portion of the screen , then as if you use the paper for different users : this includes artists , web designers and people with a visual impairment . this documentation is a complete manual for using &amp; k@@ likes ; &quot;
&quot; it may be a powerful application , which is continually expanded by new functions . it is optimized for use on low @-@ performance machines . &quot;
&quot; starting a window appears like above . the main window of &amp; k@@ likes ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window displays the enlarged window , is an enlarged area of the screen and is referred to as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; set in default setting , the area around the cursor like a movable L@@ upe . alternatively , you can be able to present a select screen area in the magni@@ fier window ( set @-@ man@@ nequ@@ ins ) or the surroundings of the mouse cursor at the screen ( eg . on the left side of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse @-@ cursor in the enlarged window , select the cursor mouse cursor . please note that the cursor is still unable to recognise the shape of the cursor . this is always the standard box ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can shift it with the arrow and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following manner : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magnific@@ ation window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can cat@@ ches the content of the magnific@@ ation tree and shift it . this also goes with the arrow buttons . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key ; taste , or the M@@ M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination you can change the size of the selection window . note that the upper left corner of the selection seat remains firm , and only to move the lower right corner . &quot;
&quot; you may send a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer to insert in a file ( to insert it later into other applications ) , turn the picture and much more . &quot;
&quot; start or stopping the update of the display . the upgrade of the update brings , that the required CPU time against 0 goes . &quot;
&quot; select the Update rate ( Very low , low , medium , high , High@@ ch , Very high ) . the higher the Update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
in this mode a selection window will be displayed . the selected range is displayed in a window .
&quot; it may be used automatically to save files , opening up a new window , opening up a new window , prints , no@@ vices ( with the button document again in the &amp; Con@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ lar@@ ds and m@@ illing &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; you may also known as &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; it is a scre@@ enshot . you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use an area of the screen , so as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the printed printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is for different people of benefit : from research or artist to Web@@ designer or visual impair@@ ments . &quot;
extensive user documentation you can find with help : / k@@ like ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; one or start m@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ likes ) .
&amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; was developed by Ola@@ f Schmidt o@@ j@@ sch@@ mid@@ t @ k@@ de@@ .org and Sar@@ ang Lak@@ are Sar@@ ang @ user@@ s.@@ s@@ f@@ .net and Michael For@@ ster For@@ ster @ f@@ mi@@ .@@ uni @-@ pass@@ au@@ .de .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse @-@ click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is a while on the same spot . it &apos;s meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome ( repeti@@ tive beam syndrome ) and those of each mouse click pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; em@@ ulates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is going on the same place . it &apos;s meant to help people who spec@@ ulate the repeti@@ tive Criminal in in@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) syndrome and those of each mouse click pain . besides this , it may em@@ ulate the move with the mouse . however , this does not require little practice . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can handle the pain that is caused by clicking the mouse , and helps so many people to use the computer without pain . unfortunately , you can also catch pain associated with your computer &apos;s use , you should seek a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to clarify it again : even if &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool can avoid pain that are caused by clicking the mouse , it is against sor@@ eness that may be caused by the mouse due to the mouse , useless . and as with all ergonomic aids , the result may be different for everyone . &quot;
&quot; the use of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; col@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and carries a mouse click , once you set the movement short . &quot;
&quot; if the smart p@@ one is activated , makes &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a break after it has installed the dump of the mouse button . now move the mouse , waiting it until the end of the movement , before the det@@ ach of the mouse button is executed . this way , you can run the dial in the pressing mouse button . this intelligent moving requires a little practice , but you get used quickly . &quot;
&quot; this sof@@ tening time must be hidden after the end of the mouse movement , before &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; a mouse @-@ click will lead . &quot;
&quot; is intelligent moving turned on , the swi@@ pe pi@@ ping time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here the time is set , the &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; after the shut@@ down the mouse is waiting , if there is no time left again , no loading of the mouse is done . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; now activ@@ ates the clicks , generates a slow move to the right and back , followed by a break , a click with the right mouse button . a slow move to the left and back leads a double @-@ click . these movements are started in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .txt for the first time , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound appears hesit@@ ating , you may want to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , choose sound system and here the rider General . there is a sli@@ der Sound Bu@@ ffer , which you set to shor@@ ten a lower value in order to shor@@ ten the responses . &quot;
&quot; if this option is marked , &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool is started ; this function is currently only under &amp; k@@ de ; available in G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please select the relevant documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; set all settings on the values back when opening the dialog . have you already implemented the button , the settings will be put on the stand after the final dump of apply . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; first with the preferences . in particular , the smart move should let you first turned off . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later turn the smart shifting . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to decrease the answer @-@ times of &amp; k@@ de ; in case of sounds . &quot;
&quot; first , you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains : clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window , which do not represent a link , does not lead to unwanted responses . you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse cras@@ hes , you should clean your mouse . this is usually pretty simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse @-@ ball , but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse @-@ ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to take out the mouse @-@ ball . as this happens , from mouse to mouse can be different . however , it should quickly be clear if you see the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the roles . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the so@@ iling can easily connect with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations the operating system inter@@ rup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; if it has just begun a failure . if in this case , you use the smart shifting , this means that &amp; col@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the operation does not end any more by the slogan of the mouse button . &quot;
&quot; this happens when you use &amp; col@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; using another window manager , and move a window . &quot;
&quot; the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click . thereby , the status of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool is reset ; and you can work as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter the text , tries &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another position . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor up where you want to have it . but , do not leave the mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you &apos;re looking for a key@@ hole reaction . safe zones for the mouse cursor are &amp; eg . the grey spaces for the mouse @-@ cursor are &amp; eg . the gray areas around the tool@@ box and menus and the cover lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent reloc@@ ating , but I don &apos;t make it to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent reloc@@ ating is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it &apos;s very convenient to perform this way , to insert it into the cli@@ p@@ board and re @-@ insert any other action , in which you want to move the mouse while holding the mouse button . here are some advice on this : &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent reloc@@ ating if you just start using &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; mark the text instead , follow the cursor button down , while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and then pressing the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . this becomes each time , when &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; the mouse button pus@@ hes a sound like a mouse click . so you can use the intelligent moving even without the audi@@ ble mou@@ sec@@ lick . but this requires some exercise . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; use the X@@ test expansion for &amp; X Win@@ dow , which should be the case on most of the system . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse clicks is only available when the system has a sound card and speaker and this is well furnished .
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; pressing the mouse @-@ cursor soon as soon as the mouse @-@ cursor is short @-@ har@@ med . this program was developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI &apos;s syndrome and to which the actu@@ ation of the mouse cras@@ hing pains . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mou@@ set@@ ool ; can also be configured so that there is a particular time waiting for a pulling process begins , before the mouse button is lo@@ osed out . in this way , the pulling and depos@@ iting with the mouse can also be done . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with the bl@@ unt users can let their computer speak for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , the mu@@ te user can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list of the talk process , which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( lin@@ kes scre@@ enshot ) , enter the command that will later be used for voice output of text . further details can be found in the description of the furnishings . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , you can choose the default text pass@@ book . from the text passages you can often choose text passages , without having to type them in . the text passages can of course be processed . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right of the scre@@ enshot ) , you determine the dictionary for the vocabulary . &amp; k@@ mouth ; reads the K@@ DE documentation of the selected language to determine the frequency of individual words . additionally , you can un@@ subscribe to the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ illed words can be added to the vocabulary . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the scanning property of your propositions ( the lower white field in the scre@@ enshot ) and a publishing memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the scre@@ enshot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth . properly , you can enter the propositions you want to hear in the input field , which you want to hear . each spec@@ ulated set is attached to the memory memory . you can select from it , which should be discussed again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the setup dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth . this dialog contains two cart@@ on cards , voice output and settings , the site of vocabulary , as well as the site K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card version , you specify the command to call a language generator . in the box below the input field , you set the sign code with the text to be handed down to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass on the text . select the tick @-@ box , if the text is to be handed down as default to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following Plac@@ eholder : &quot;
&quot; of course , the instruction on the language output is provided by your language generator . this command can be found in the documentation for your language generator . examples of this are found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; using as possible as voice service is to use &amp; k@@ mouth ; as first attempt to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the cost of this option is useful , even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first drop @-@ down promotion , according to the selection of a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the menu text password or in the bag for text pass@@ able books . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of so@@ cks , the selected text passage is directly added and inserted in addition to the input memory . with the selection of In the input field the chosen text passage will be transferred only to the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second selection box , the editing pane of text pass@@ book can be set if the text pass@@ book can be automatically saved in closing the editing pane . &quot;
&quot; the book is saved with the selection of text pass@@ codes . if you choose changes , the text pass@@ able book will not be saved . select E@@ saving , will be saved &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text pass@@ book is to be stored . &quot;
&quot; the site words contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for vocabulary . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than a dictionary . with this selection , you can choose the dictionary for vocabulary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons on the right side , you can delete or add the order of books or export them into a file . below the list you can use the name and the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; select for this source the desired language ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; and then reads the file &apos;s file . in addition , the frequency of the individual words is determined simply by lowering of the occurrence . in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Office.@@ org dictionary , to insert only correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth , then asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how these should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option you put a new , empty dictionary without any entries to . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary in the course of time . &quot;
the main area of the window for the processing of text pass@@ codes is double @-@ divided . in the upper part the text is displayed as a tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part , you can edit a selected item . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the associated keyboard short@@ cut . if you have selected a text password , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions like new text passages or books add or delete selected text passages and books , you can either reach the menu bar , in tool@@ bar or via a folding menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages , you can change by drag with the mouse to the new place or with the arrow buttons and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is cut out and copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text box is selected , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the publishing . &quot;
&quot; the chosen text is copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . if in the input field a text box is selected , it is used otherwise the selected areas of the publishing . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if text is located in the input field , it is used otherwise the selected propositions of the publishing . &quot;
&quot; this menu entry is enabled , a shifting tool@@ bar is displayed by buttons for frequently used commands . the tool@@ bar is by default above the editing window , directly under the menu bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the ch@@ ain@@ ted left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is enabled , a narrow track is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the condition of &amp; k@@ mouth ; displayed when not crossed , this status bar is blan@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; if this menu @-@ application is comple@@ tes , a removable table for text pass@@ able books with entries is displayed . the bar is by default down the editing window under the tool@@ bar . by mouse @-@ clicking on the ch@@ ain@@ ted left side and drag the tool@@ bar can be moved to another point . &quot;
&quot; most likely , you don &apos;t have the command for the Language issue correct or not completely entered . open settings k@@ mouth . open ... , open the page General settings and enter the command for voice output on cart@@ on voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice practices to further details . ) &quot;
&quot; Festival is a Language issue of the Edinburgh University . currently only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh is currently supported . the license permits to use the festival free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the folder / usr / local / festival area . the command to speech is then explained : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a in &amp; Java ; currently he supports English pron@@ unciation . currently , it only supports the English language . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up speech output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS has been installed in the folder / usr / local / fre@@ et@@ ts . the VO is then possible with one of the three command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched as default . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it conver@@ ts a list of ph@@ on@@ emen in a Wav@@ ed shop , so you need an additional program to cr@@ ush the text in phon@@ eme . the license permits it to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ military applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example H@@ adi@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ eme for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that H@@ adi@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA will be installed in / usr / local / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , H@@ adi@@ fax likes to get the last character of the text , so that an additional sign must be requested . the full command is therefore more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo ; ) _ BAR _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp / t@@ mp
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option is to be switched on as default .
&quot; the VO dem@@ on by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; D ; -@@ further language service , which provides a standard interface for voice @-@ overs . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being further developed in SV@@ N . it uses modules to support various voice @-@ overs systems . &quot;
&quot; as the adjustment of the language @-@ generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use as a voice service as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth . &quot;
&quot; to adjust the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service , which appears in the setup dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; around &amp; k@@ mouth ; successfully used , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ mouth ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB storage ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , which depends on the individual of your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak to print text by the machine . it is saved a list already saved sentences , which can always be re@@ generating the user again . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; does not apply any language profi@@ ci@@ ers . on the machine must be a language profi@@ ci@@ ers installed .

filter for drawing lift provide a good opportunity to correct and correct . the file k@@ mail .x@@ ml that is sent to the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is a good example . you remove the tags and b from the news that can be sent as provided in most cases . read this also .
filters are one of the advanced abilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; Fil@@ ters will be edited text , before he is sent to the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher . they are useful for enhancing the pron@@ unciation to select a suitable language and subject , or to select certain shortcomings of language profi@@ ci@@ ons and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the working method of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; &quot; speech disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; differs four kinds of texts . &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the output of the screen readers are read , the aforementioned orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is reserved to hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders are continued after the issue of warning .
news have the next highest priority . a message inter@@ rup@@ ting normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of one application to read the messages . while you are looking for a long text on a website you can see with &amp; k@@ mouth ; someone &apos;s noti@@ fications are also news . read about this .
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order that you encounter from the card orders is a text order . K@@ Say@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text entries . text entries are intended for the output longer texts , which have no special urgency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queue , with the exception of the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application reads the output of a screen reading , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just such a pre @-@ reading , this output will hold and end . &quot;
&quot; first , you must know that filters are never applied to the output of screen readers . you will be applied to normal warnings , messages and text entries as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages apply . &quot;
filters process the text and pass it on to the next filters . at present there are three types of filters .
filters are carried out as modules . in the future there can be even further types of filters .
strings replace parts of a text by other text . you can select either as words or as regular expressions as : - ) by text or for the form@@ atting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better comprehensible form .
&amp; XML ; -@@ section use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from a format into another format . included in the scope of delivery of &amp; X@@ HTML ; are included in SS@@ ML .
&quot; with inter@@ locking filtering you can send orders depending on the contents of the text or depending on the program that sent the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; if you have set a female voice for example , you can read text of K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ e can be read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these various filters has adjustable rules , according to which he is applied for a voice output . if the filter does not apply , he will not apply the text to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; D ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent it will be edited by all activated filters , which were installed on the page below . the processing through the filters occurs in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of the furnished normal filters . if a filter is not enabled , it is not activated and won &apos;t be used . filters will be loaded from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to add a new filter . select the type of filter , and the further below is displayed below . &quot;
&quot; for the installation of string composition filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text is exchanged against the corresponding replacement text . large and small is not observed when compared . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filters . you can choose this name as you like , it just needs to differentiate yourself from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in column correspondence and replaces it in accordance with the string from the column . the list is processed in the sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file to save the current list or delete a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the available list . &quot;
&quot; here is a language entered , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks for the text order one of the languages listed here . you can also select multiple languages if you hold the &amp; C@@ tr@@ l button in the mouse @-@ click ; button pressed . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID program will get you with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; D@@ Bus ; numbers you need to leave . if for example , &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; the applic@@ ation@@ ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 can only be typ@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; the filter composition filter is applied only to the text when match all conditions with an entry in the box of the Filter if match . all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all the texts . &quot;
&quot; when compared with words , the string filter filters uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ . the words must therefore be restricted by divi@@ ding signs ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual , you will find no instructions for writing regular printing . if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ulations &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; Reg@@ ular &amp; # 160 ; prints can be found in the package k@@ ambiguous . &quot;
&amp; XML ; Trans@@ former translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from a format into another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard for such transformations . it can only be applied on ben@@ evol@@ ently XML . the relief program x@@ abl@@ t@@ pro@@ c needs to be installed on your system .
enter the path for the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the ambient variable path is also ranges x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c .
&quot; with the speaker type filter you can send texts to a certain speaker , who is set up on the cardboard card , or to a speaker with certain properties . you can specify , for example , that texts should be pre@@ viewed by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before you specify a text to the filter , it is looking for a narr@@ ator for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program suggests the text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; sends , and the characteristics of the spokes@@ person on the card speaker . with the speaker cable , you can write the selected speaker . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied when the text contains the regulatory expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; regular print installed , you can access it by clicking on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you define the features of the filter conditions stated by you . if the text selected the above filter conditions , the speaker is selected , the desired requirement is closest to . click the button on the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to save or load your chat settings or delete all settings .
&quot; the spre@@ ader filter is applied only to the text when all conditions apply with an entry in the box format , if apply . you have to enter at least one condition . &quot;
&quot; the VO API , by &amp; k@@ de ; to give the programmers their applications T@@ TS @-@ skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD over &amp; D@@ Bus ; &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , with the language profi@@ ci@@ ers to be added to K@@ TT@@ SD , so that &apos;s synthes@@ izer can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the VO API of &amp; k@@ de ; you can find the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is on the website ; Acces@@ sibility website ( htt@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .

&quot; the text of the text is to read and select a language code as &amp; eg , en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands that you can use . for a list of all commands you give

none of the mentioned language profi@@ ci@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ Con@@ tract filters , but when using the module for Festival websites are not read . &quot;
due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta you have to install the ( male British ) voice Rab _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able works at all . you don &apos;t have to do that if you do not use this voice to pre @-@ read websites . make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c inst@@ alls and find over the surrounding variable path .
&quot; certain signs or pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters appear to cause error during synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so entire propositions will be super@@ imposed or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first , make sure that the option character code is set to the right value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain signs or words , these may be solved by a string container filter . &quot;

&quot; the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; &quot; uses a adap@@ table module architecture for language profi@@ ci@@ ers . if you would like to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ iz@@ ers , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is used for supporting SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; trans@@ conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the command apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages col@@ lu@@ bs and development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ disp@@ at@@ cher &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you purchased the source text from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source file archive , or have downloaded the Tar@@ ball from the source file , and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use &amp; kt@@ ts ; first use whether a speech disp@@ at@@ cher is working properly with your language profi@@ ci@@ ers . therefore , you can use the shell script to do it . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.@@ 4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; that &apos;s the program of speech disp@@ at@@ cher , the program k@@ tt@@ ms@@ gr is designed to be further developed that the establishment of speech disp@@ at@@ cher is directly possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is dis@@ semb@@ led into individual sentences . the user can return pro@@ posi@@ tional or sat@@ ary , repeating the output or break down . &quot;
&quot; when an application gives text on &amp; kt@@ ts ; moreover , she can request the features of the preferred speaker . if you have a speaker , whose language English and whose gender is feminine , this is automatically chosen the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a narr@@ ation chooses , see you in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the map present@@ er to add and add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card @-@ card spokes@@ person is displayed . as an example , in the following the setup of the module for Festival Interactive is shown . details of the modules can be found under . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to the festival is included in path , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the drawing code for text , which is handed over to the festival . with votes that are handed over to the festival , this setting is automatically made . general applies that Western languages use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 1 , eastern languages like Czech or Slov@@ ak use ISO 8@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sli@@ ces , you put volume , microphone , and sound height of the synthetic language . if you can &apos;t select some regul@@ ators and can display these grey , the voice you choose will not be able to do these settings . &quot;
&quot; some votes such as Multi@@ Sy@@ n votes require a number of seconds to be loaded on account of their size . if you mark this attack , these voices will already be syn@@ ced at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD , so ( with a large storage power ) the first set is synthes@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; if this connection cannot be selected , you still have no speaker ( or forget to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; is this tip marked , is indicated at the start of k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s the program window k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s . otherwise , after starting only the icon k@@ b gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; this strip @-@ box is marked and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not work , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD is reading a text . by doing this , you have the possibility to read or otherwise use it . &quot;
&quot; here are all orders in the queue , together with the application that has set the order , the current status of the contract , the number of propositions and the exactly edited sentence . the speaker ID corresponds to the column ID on the card speaker . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this series you can order sat@@ ary in the order , which is selected in the list below , pre @-@ handed or returned . ( but not each order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on OK , all changes of the settings ( also on the other cart@@ on cards ) are taken over and k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this symbol to show the program window again . &quot;
&quot; when the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead Al@@ sa , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de , click on the map audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here only text orders are performed and managed . editions of screen readers , warnings and messages will not be shown . further information on the news types of &amp; kt@@ ts can be found here . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output . if a component can not be selected , has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the appropriate audio @-@ du@@ l compiled or &amp; kt@@ ts ; can not load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; when G@@ stre@@ amer or a@@ Ko@@ de should be used for the audio output , select here the audio output . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you need to install at least one module . have Al@@ sa selected , select the PC@@ M device . &quot;
&quot; set the intercom speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds about half the half and 200@@ nbsp ; % roughly the double normal microphone rate . thus , these settings must be implemented , the program must be installed . &quot;
click to apply to take over the new settings for the running &amp; kt@@ ts ; -@@ System .
&quot; the list of Al@@ sa devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you &apos;ll have to find out which device works with you . in doubt , choose standard . &quot;
&quot; on this card of cart@@ on , you can set special actions that will always be executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of language orders : &quot;
&quot; the issue of Screen Re@@ a@@ ers has the highest priority . it is pre @-@ drawn to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the output of the screen readers are read , the aforementioned orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have priority the next priority . this level is important news as &amp; eg . processor is reserved to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and norm@@ alized text . these orders will resume after the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message leaves normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you are looking for a long text on a web site , you can talk with &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone welcome you to enter the room . &quot;
&quot; if a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reading , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file will always be played if a regular text order is interrupted . if both introductory sound is active as well as introductory notice , the introductory sound will be played before the introductory notice . &quot;
&quot; settings on these cart@@ on are valid only for normal text entries . for messages , warnings and expenses of screen readers , there are no special actions if this will be interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ notebook messages , launch k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s and click noti@@ fications . the card details appears . &quot;
&quot; mark this tick @-@ box to turn the pre@@ dict@@ ator of &amp; k@@ de ; this setting is not marked , the other settings are disabled and clear ; does not read any noti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; if this option is marked , noti@@ fications , in which a sound is played , of &amp; kt@@ ts ; not read . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add events to list or to delete it . if you click on the button Add , a dialog , where you want to select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
this event reads the message that reads and conversation ; if someone is mentioned in a IR@@ C message to your nickname .
&quot; all events , for which there is nothing else stated in the list , are ignored by &amp; ct@@ ose ; ignored . &quot;
&quot; use this selection box to specify , what &apos;s to do ; if an event includes . you have the following selection options : &quot;
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the text you want . you can use the following Plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter the features of the desired speaker . standard select the speaker who is displayed in the list on the card controller as top @-@ top associated entry .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . is specified for a specific event of a specific application , this action is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . as the last option comes the action to carry out which is specified under standard ( all other events ) . &quot;
the event all noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this you can specify the noti@@ fying noti@@ fications as follows :
&quot; use the button store to save the settings for the noti@@ fications in a file . use the button store , to load stored settings from a file . the invited events will start with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click delete . all entries except All disadvantages are deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W@@ 3@@ C standard to mark text for voice output , volume speed , volume , sex of voice and pitch . furthermore , brands for the control of pron@@ unciation by example abbrevi@@ ations . SS@@ ML is a part of the vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W@@ 3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partly and only in basic functions . the following limitations are present :
you have to install the Rab _ di@@ phone voice ( bri@@ tish male ) since this is the default vote which is used at the SS@@ ML edition .
&quot; if the settings for speed or tape in the Festival configuration dialog is not set to 100@@ nbsp ; % is set , SS@@ ML text is usually very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;
&lt; ! &#91; CD@@ ATA &#91; &lt; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; En@@ co@@ ding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &lt; ! DO@@ CT@@ Y@@ PE / / D@@ T@@ D Syn@@ thesis 1.0 / / EN &quot; htt@@ p . who has slept in my bed ? asked M@@ om B@@ är . who has slept in my bed ? asked B@@ ären@@ kind . &#93; &#93; &gt;
&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pro@@ posi@@ tional filters ( SD@@ R filter ) . SB@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . this can also begin to be faster with the text order , as only the first set can be syn@@ th@@ ised , not the whole text order . thus , you can also stop on the card ticket orders , or stop or stop and dis@@ rupt , even if the language chan@@ ger does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; here you can see the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . when the first start comes from &amp; kt@@ ts ; it is automatically set up with the pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter . you can change their settings , or add further pro@@ posi@@ tional filters , but beginners will be cancelled . &quot;
&quot; easiest to learn the selection of speaking selection through taste bu@@ ds . place the speaker selection again , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . of course , turn off the speaker card , and of course you need to have more than one speaker , otherwise the filter is in@@ effective . &quot;
&quot; can then proceed faster with the pre @-@ reading , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can last very long , &quot;
you can then check out text orders on the card orders or break up even if the language profi@@ ci@@ ers does not support this function .
&quot; for these reasons the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter is automatically set up , if you take k@@ tt@@ sm@@ s for the first time . it can not be switched off , only removed . do not change anything about this filter , unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
statutes limit filters compare text with a regular expression for pro@@ posi@@ tional and add a tab@@ ular sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the pro@@ posi@@ tional sign ( dec@@ imal code 8 ) to the typ@@ ing limits ( default code 8 ) are automatically removed from the text ) . please note that the standard layout filter filter is applicable .
SB@@ D filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ ussion ) , warnings , messages or the output of Screen Re@@ a@@ vers used . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed from the normal pro@@ posi@@ tional filter filter filter , you can insert it again by loading the file standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; on the card selection menu , you can write the speaker settings for application . the card controller is displayed when &quot;
use of the default ( the top on the card speaker ) . in other words : no speaker properties are defined .
&quot; use of the most suitable speaker , which displays all the properties of a appointed speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker . otherwise , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker who closest to the original properties . &quot;
&quot; select the method for entering the desired language properties , by clicking on one of the selection pots . &quot;
&quot; choose the features of the desired speaker . if this property does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
&quot; mark this approach , if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markings here . &quot;
&quot; because language is a critical factor when using the issue , it will always be considered a prime feature . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you possibly want to specify the attribute language in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all properties in the area Spe@@ ech , which is closest to the following , click the button default , and then use on speaker , which is closest to the following . &quot;
in this case 0 for the last text order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number the entry is 0 required ) .
&quot; tt@@ sm@@ s cras@@ hes immediately when it is started . I have de@@ pressed Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get any back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; G@@ it@@ amer is cras@@ hed and done . probably you have to register G@@ NO@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x is the command G@@ ST @-@ register @-@ 0.@@ 8 . if the problem is not solved this , perhaps a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer are installed . you can try to update or un@@ install G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output about Al@@ sa is not working when I keep playing music simultaneously with another application . if I hold a text order , free@@ zes &amp; kt@@ ts ; a message appears on the &amp; console ; appears a message that says : to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system there is the problem that conflicts in Al@@ sa occur , which prohi@@ bit the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . hints for possible solutions can be found on the website of the Al@@ sa project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ ect@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
I have downloaded an additional voice for the festival on the Internet . I installed it and can use them at the festival but k@@ tt@@ sm@@ gr does not show this voice .
&quot; add in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tival@@ int / end the new voice . as a guide you can serve the other entries . if that is successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice to the developer . &quot;
&quot; on the map audio , there is a setting speed . thus this works , the program has to be installed and configured using the environmental variable path . some synthes@@ iz@@ ers such as Festival Interactive offer even on the card unit for speaker device . depending on the chosen voice , this action is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the microphone speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML , pre@@ read . ( see that the HTML file is transformed into SS@@ ML ; ) De@@ activate either the filter for the transformation of &amp; HTML ; according to &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are entirely bold , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ according to @-@ SS@@ ML @-@ mol@@ ding filters . &quot;
I don &apos;t create websites with a female voice to be read . I have appointed a female festival speaker . I read the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able Gender does not seem to work . thus , the festival does not produce a bug , the x@@ s@@ l file di@@ jects the converting SS@@ ML to S@@ aber @-@ tags . the same goes for the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
I have added a self @-@ chain composition filter and now I can advance in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more sat@@ ary orders is displayed , the order consists only of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation ( point , question characters , signs , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) must not be fil@@ tered . use for this character instead a filter to the pro@@ posi@@ tional detection . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with Al@@ sa conflict with audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t stop playing music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; free@@ zes also when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of Al@@ sa ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; with date July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de does not support real breaks . if you stop a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts ; stopping , the current set is still read@@ more advanced . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the microphone speed , but otherwise it is not necessary . Deb@@ ian users can install as x with the command apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included in most &amp; Linux ; -@@ CDs already . &quot;

&quot; Festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is laid out . the quality of the votes is generally good , and there are several voices and languages supported . in many voices , you can set volume , microphone speed , and pitch @-@ height . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with Festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( Male British ) voice of Rab _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices , you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations on disclosure . &quot;
&quot; this voice requires 1,@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in a early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in a early stage of development . un@@ zip the software in the festival / lib / 02 / Russian / Russian . if you enter Russian voices , you need to enter the votes of ms@@ u _ ru _ n@@ sh _ di@@ phone . choose a cy@@ ri@@ ll@@ ic ( 8 @-@ bit ) co@@ ding such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux ; distri@@ butions as first to the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the option co@@ ding must be set to ISO 29@@ 5@@ 59 @-@ 2 option . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the option code must be set to an 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ril@@ lic , such as KO@@ I@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
the festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; the synthes@@ izer will take over the le@@ xi@@ an analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from

&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ monitor centre ; the administration of network interfaces , rout@@ ing and the DNS settings allows . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ monitor centre ; allows the user to manage a set of system and desktop settings for a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ monitor centre ; can be called by selecting K menu @-@ contro@@ l@@ center . &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; -@@ package was designed to enable users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ center ; create the areas of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple surface for the user :
&quot; after installation , a new Module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the module network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by choice of k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu , launched . &quot;
it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware not install . physical devices and their drivers have already have to be functional and configured to ensure that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all shows and enables the setting of the network properties .
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices will be installed on installing &amp; Linux ; installed and furnished . network equipment later added , the driver must be loaded according to the following files , according to the core version , are required : &quot;
&quot; module settings will be loaded when the network settings is selected in the &amp; k@@ operating center ; -@@ index selected . when starting the module &apos;s network settings , this system will automatically detect the platform on the system automatically . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the chosen selection is offered . it is the best to choose from the list that will be best suited to distribution and the release version . by selecting the setting non @-@ again , setting will be hit permanent . when the next start of network settings the choice will be automatically set . &quot;
&quot; changing network settings is only possible in system administration mode . previously , all options are grey , which means , the settings can be considered , the change mode is not possible . in system administration mode you will be able to enter the password mode at the lower end of the module . it is the input of the password . &quot;
&quot; in the system administration mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three rider : &quot;
&quot; the rider network interfaces is for managing the network equipment of the system . all available network devices are displayed . from rider network interfaces , the following tasks can be performed : &quot;
the settings are set @-@ in network interfaces by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button . you can set up the button on the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the button &quot; &quot; Exten@@ ded &quot; &quot; button shows the dialog with further possibilities . &quot;
&quot; with the choice of Autom@@ atic , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server is required at the same time with the start of system services . the D@@ H@@ CP@@ - or BO@@ O@@ TP server will not require any further setting . in the selective list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the selection manual , the TCP / IP address can be specified without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . in the network mask , the IP @-@ mask is set to be set . &quot;
&quot; if this option is marked , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during the boats . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the &amp; kon@@ sole ; you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the required equipment . switching on an in@@ activated network device is done by selecting from the list and clicking interface .... &quot;
&quot; network devices can be activated or switched on , depending on the need . switch off a activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking interface .... &quot;
&quot; defines the IP address of the computer in the local sub@@ net , which provides the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with machines in other sub@@ networks . &quot;
&quot; if the computer is available more than a network interface , the interface needs to be added to the network in which the Gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a computer with DNS support replaces a complete domain name through the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers requires only IP addresses . if the computer htt@@ p / / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org requested , the DNS sol@@ ves this name to an IP address like 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5,@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
the machine for attri@@ bution part of the equ@@ est@@ rian nam@@ esp@@ ace allows you to easily manage this list . entries can be added , removed or changed de@@ den@@ .@@ DNS entries can be re@@ arranged by selecting a inser@@ ting and indication or down@@ grade in the list with buttons , or can be re@@ arranged in the priority . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to the nam@@ esp@@ ouse solution , a DNS server can be added . it will add the dialogue new name server . &quot;
&quot; first , you must enter the IP @-@ address of the DNS server and then click the button Add . the entry then is inserted in the list . &quot;
&quot; out of the group machine for naming resolution , select an entry and then click on the button Edit .... It will display the dialog box . &quot;
&quot; the list specifically known machine describes machine name @-@ to @-@ IP addresses for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used for bo@@ oting when no DNA server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually the list contains a familiar calcul@@ ator some entries , the &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses can be used . these are still available in the test version of IP to replace 4 in the future version 4 . &quot;
enter the IP @-@ address of the known machine and click Add .... The dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; insert the name of the known machine and click the button Add . if the well @-@ known machine has several Ali@@ as name , de button Add several times , and enter the other Ali@@ as name . &quot;
select an entry of a named computer from the list and select Edit .... the dialog &apos;s desired machine will be shown .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then with clicking on OK the list of static hosts is updated . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module settings are not immediately effective in the system . to enable changes , needs to be set in a &amp; console ; the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is htt@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net to download the latest version of the source text .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually r@@ pm @-@ packages ) , it ranges when &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t installed . &quot;
the installation of the finished version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the r@@ pm package and install in a &amp; kon@@ sole ; with r@@ pm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with a graphi@@ cally surface like the package or the installation tool for their distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; D ; not , but additionally the development packages are required with libraries and other things . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information on basic network technology is given , in the second , all of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf file will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; this section can not replace further knowledge of IP networks . in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information on integrating the PCs into a small ( home ) network is im@@ par@@ ted . &quot;
IP @-@ networks operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found large spread . IP@@ v@@ 5 is expected to continue in the near future . this description is therefore currently focusing on widespread IP@@ v@@ 4 .
&quot; one of the most important information is to assign the IP @-@ address to a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg . workplace is the network administrator who accounts for a valid IP address or if available , d@@ h@@ c@@ p may not be chosen any number ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up a own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be chosen for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflict with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not passed on the internet , so any usage is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the internet for such machines can be made possible by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , they are usually used in the area of 192.168.@@ 1.1 to 192.168.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 . the area is big enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;

&amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; is an application that allows you to run other programs according to a timetable in the background . it is a graphic interface for the UNIX operating system cr@@ on .
&quot; when starting from &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can already see a list of selected tasks and related ambient variables . if you use &amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; as root user , this appears both for all users of the system as well as system internal tasks . every folder can rise up and folded . &quot;
&quot; for a de@@ activated task , program name and parameters are not shown and under description appears de@@ activated . &quot;
the variable ambient variables that otherwise use existing environment variables for all tasks out of force . in a de@@ activated variable appears as a description de@@ activated .
&quot; to create a new task , select first the task folder . go then in the menu to Edit New .... Altern@@ ate this you can also click the right mouse button on the tasks folder and on the appearing context menu New ... select or C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the start@@ ling program you can enter here . you can either select a relative or an absolute default name . if you want to search the program first , press release .... &quot;
&quot; choose the minute ( s ) to which the task should be executed . with &amp; k@@ cr@@ on , you can specify the minutes in five steps . &quot;
&quot; if you specify both mon@@ day @-@ day ( e ) and week@@ day ( s ) , the task will be executed at a suitable date and on a week@@ day . if you run for example the 1st and 15th and Sunday , every Sunday of the month , regardless of which date they fall . &quot;
&quot; as with the creation of new tasks , changes will only be active when the c@@ ron@@ tab is saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut out a task , select first the task at first . go to editing . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and select and select C@@ tr@@ l ; X . &quot;
&quot; to copy a task , select first the chosen task at first . go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click on the task and select copying , or press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a task , first must be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then it is available at all . select the task folder . then go to editing . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the task folder and insert it , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; V . &quot;
&quot; to make changes to a task , select first one . go to the Edit menu option ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the task and change it ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; O. , then the dialogue will be dealt with , in which you can edit the chosen task . &quot;
&quot; to delete a task , select the option to delete . go to the Edit menu option . &quot;
&quot; to enable or disable a task , select it and determine the condition with the menu item En@@ able . in@@ active tasks are lab@@ eled in their description with in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click the right mouse button on the task and selecting an activation . make sure that program name , parameters and description are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; to perform one task immediately , select it and then go to Edit Now . &quot;
&quot; to create a new environment variable , select first the variable folder . then go to the Edit menu option ... &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can click with the right mouse button on the variables folder and select New ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; N . &quot;
type the name of the variable name . you can also choose from the list of the most frequently used ambient variables ; click on the arrow next to the field for the variable name . these are :
to send e @-@ mails from the back program to another than the normal address
&quot; as when creating new variables , changes will only be made when the c@@ ron@@ tab was saved . &quot;
&quot; to cut a variable , select first the variable variable . go then to edit . &quot;
&quot; to copy a ambient variable , select first the variable variable . go to Edit Copy . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can right click on the variable and select copying , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; C . &quot;
&quot; to insert a ambient variable , first must be cut or copied into the cli@@ p@@ board . only then , the option inser@@ ting is available at all . select the variable folder . then go to editing . &quot;
&quot; to change a variable , select first the variable variable . go then to Edit Change .... Altern@@ ate this you can edit with the right mouse button on the variable and change ... select , or you press C@@ tr@@ l ; o .@@ It will then edit the dialog variables , in which you can edit the variable . &quot;
&quot; to delete a ambient variable , select first the variable . go to Edit Del@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; to activate or de@@ activate a ambient variable , select it and place the condition with the menu item En@@ et firmly . in a de@@ activated variable appears under description de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can also click on the variable and select the variable button . make sure that name and value of the variables are displayed correctly . &quot;
&quot; when all tasks and ambient variables were entered or changed , you still have to save the c@@ ron@@ tab . select the menu item file saving . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , you can press C@@ tr@@ l ; S press . changes or supplements to tasks or variables are only then active . &quot;
&quot; it appears the standard box ; -@@ pressure dialog . if you select , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the printer dialog . &quot;
print the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have extended permission .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example vi@@ xie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; uses the command c@@ ron@@ tab to change the schedules of the users . &quot;

&amp; nbsp ; is a backup work for belt drives based on tar . it offers the possibility to create multiple archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer several archives on a tape . the first goal was to answer a question which my wife asked : how much longer does it take if you secure ?
&quot; before a band can be used , it must be involved in &amp; dat files . it can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; set the band back and reads the pre @-@ voltage information of the belt . recognizes &amp; k@@ date , when the band won &apos;t be form@@ at@@ ted , you will be asked whether the band should form@@ at@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; k@@ dat ; the pre @-@ spell , it searches for the matching index on your disk . can this not be found , you will be asked whether the index is to be newly created . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol changes to the belt drive , to indicate that the band is integrated . in the stat@@ us@@ bar , a corresponding message appears . the content of the belt can now be brow@@ sed by dra@@ fting the entry for the band . &quot;
&quot; before the drop of the belt , first of all , the integration must be resolved . there are three methods to achieve this . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Secon@@ dly , there is a change of symbol for the band to recognize that the integration of the band has been solved and displays a message in the status bar . the band can now be cast out without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape of &amp; col@@ dat files can be used , it must be dated and dated . &quot;
&quot; a tap@@ es must be form@@ at@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this procedure does not meet the form@@ atting when you need , it must happen before you are form@@ at@@ ted from the tape of &amp; k@@ dat files . Flo@@ ppy inter@@ ns usually do not need a form@@ atting of the tape , DAT drives , however . &quot;
&quot; after entering the belt name and the capacity goes back , with the form@@ atting of the belt . all data on the tape are lost automatically ! after conclusion of the process set , the belt is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you hit the backup process , you need to select the required files . it can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . only this file or folder is saved .
select a backup profile in the tree . only the files stated in the profile are saved .
highlight files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are secured .
right click on the local file tree and select in the menu Si@@ don ...
&quot; once the backup has been introduced , the dialog settings for backup . in this dialog you can check once again the selected files and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or the folder will be checked . &quot;
&quot; select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are examined . &quot;
right click on one of the archives and select the menu entry ...
&quot; once the audit process has been started , the dialog settings for testing . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the job folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you confirm the settings for veri@@ fying the dialog , the dialog appears . this dialog shows the progress of the audit process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can enter the restore , the files that are to be recovered . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
&quot; select a file or folder in any of the archives , which belong to the tap@@ er@@ work item . only the selected file or the sub@@ folder will be restored . &quot;
&quot; select the files from one of the archives files with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored . &quot;
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select in the Re@@ pair menu .
&quot; once the recovery process has started , the dialog settings for restoration . in this dialog you can check once again your selection and change the job folder for restoration . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for restoration , the dialog will appear re@@ plac@@ e. this dialog shows the progress of the recovery process as well as the data through@@ put and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; sometimes it proves to be necessary to re@@ generate the band file from the band &apos;s contents , this procedure del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index on two types of the band : &quot;
&quot; this creates a backup profile with the just marked files , and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile : &quot;
&quot; the current job level , in which the backup should take place . the list of the related files is automatically updated according to the selected job folder . &quot;
&quot; for any folder , which are listed under backup files , is valid only the files currently being stored on the same file system , as the folder . folder , which are on other fil@@ es@@ ystems , you can enter separately below backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; perform a incre@@ mental backup . to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only those files are secured that have since changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
del@@ etes the sn@@ apshots before the call of tar . this causes all files secured and a new snapshot file for the next backup is created .
the functionality of buttons files are su@@ cks ; and lt ; files ; files at the time of creating this documentation was not completely implemented .
you can set up the settings about the K@@ D@@ at menu ... in the Settings menu settings . the following settings allow you to make :
the complete path to device to@@ ad@@ mill for the belt drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path has to refer to the non @-@ re@@ tract variant of the belt .
&quot; if this option is active , transmitted &amp; range ; before the tape is integrated , the command returns to drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing processes can be performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the option tries to lock &amp; b ; the throw from the belt drive to lock . possibly this attitude does not work at all band@@ age drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is turned on , in solving the integration of &amp; range ; automatically the band is ej@@ ected . use this option not with flo@@ ppy guides . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , the option tries to change &amp; range ; the hardware @-@ sided block@@ size for the belt drive . not all drives support variable block@@ age sizes . no matter whether this attitude is active or not , you have to be out &amp; range ; in any case the block size for your belt drive . &quot;
if &amp; dat ; a band form@@ at@@ ted it writes a file to the start of the tape . this file should only cover a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file should be composed as follows :
&quot; the Band @-@ ID . the format of this sequence is calcul@@ ating : seconds , whereby calcul@@ er@@ name of the full name of the system is form@@ at@@ ted on which the tape was form@@ at@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that has been form@@ at@@ ted since the epoch . &quot;
the band ID is used to use a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar manage . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the content of a backup system . this symbol is only active if a band is involved .
&amp; col@@ on log ; is a &amp; D ; spect@@ ator for system protocols . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users who can &apos;t know where you can receive information about your system or where the system allows the various protocol files . furthermore it enables fast access to information about problems that occur on their server .
&quot; &amp; k@@ System@@ log ; helps users understand what your machine is in the background . the program is suitable for in@@ experienced users , who do not know where you can get information about your system or where the system deposited on the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; col@@ on log ; experienced users access fast access to information about problems which appear on their server . &amp; col@@ on log ; hence attempts to provide some more advanced function@@ alities which can be fil@@ tered and evaluated through the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 there is a number of useful features . among other things include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the other chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following scre@@ enshot , displays &amp; col@@ on log ; features available , with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily fil@@ tered and sor@@ ting . the individual opportunities for sor@@ ting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after starting the system tries &amp; col@@ lo@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocols - you will not appear , and it opens instead of a small message window , so you have not found a small message window , so you usually don &apos;t have to own a folder / var / log , for the normal user usually no permission to read . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter by a chosen criterion or according to the character strings . the list of the protocol lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only a protocol line contains next to the filter . then a protocol line contains only displayed when one of the columns contain the string of the filter search@@ engine . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry in this place . select the string of the filter dialog box , then select the name of a process , and carry you out in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in default setting and helps you to detect the important protocol lines . protocol lines of the level error are displayed with a show@@ y color as a protocol lines of the level note . the color display of protocol lines can be switched on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain process ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the cr@@ on protocol ) , you can choose the process identification ( P@@ ID ) in column process . this can be useful for example if you want to examine the output of a certain command such as the time of the sam@@ ba server . in this case , you can use filtering button . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can jump the option to new lines jump in the context menu of the main window to display all new protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; col@@ on log ; allows the display of multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the menu window to open up and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected an under@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on htt@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ soft@@ war@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find more recent information on the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; you can also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; sub@@ version archives : col@@ lo@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; - Archive
welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; system V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; the System V In@@ it rapidly develops into the standard for control of the program boot when driving the system into the &amp; Linux ; this is why it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD In@@ it . &quot;
I will not go here further on historical aspects ( e.g. because I know nothing about it : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is below / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without a new installation and re @-@ format . therefore , you must ensure that the old In@@ it was removed from there in case there was one . &quot;
the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files in a sub@@ folder of / etc are located directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ d. D@@ ort you will find r@@ c.@@ sy@@ sin@@ it and the following additional folder :
&quot; in@@ it@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start driving on the system or change to another run@@ level . system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , htt@@ p@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ backs , which will only be started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; partly under / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is actually not much use for it . you can also want to run a r@@ c.@@ c. in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel is looking for different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one he finds .
the default level level is in / etc / in@@ it@@ tab . you should be in the initial area a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column , and probably notice that the pre @-@ presented Run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can fix it carefully by restart the system and perform the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the right scripts ? if you enter ser@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no right files . instead , each entry here is a short@@ cut to one of the scripts in the directory in@@ it@@ .@@ d . &quot;
&quot; how starts and stops in@@ it actually system services ? very simple : each of the scripts is written so it is a argument like start and stop accepted . you can actually start this scripts , from hand on the command line : &quot;
&quot; this would stop the htt@@ p@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and when the K involves , the script will be called with the argument stop . if he is a S , the script is called with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes . I could have &amp; eg . a server running level , that leaves just htt@@ p@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc . also , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg . , network &amp; etc ; starts . &quot;
here you learn the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say : draw an entry from the area of Av@@ ail@@ able system services on one of the six run@@ down to start it at that level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n or change the position within one level by using it somewhere else . this will only happen if they pick an entry from the area of Av@@ ail@@ able system services .
&quot; note : entries will be moved , when you drag them into a new area . to select it only on a new run@@ down menu , you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of action . &quot;
&quot; the sor@@ ting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you have to edit the number of items of the surrounding entries before you again try to add the system service . &quot;
&quot; note : currently there is no way to restore items that were thrown into the trash . so be careful . &quot;
&quot; you can use the tab@@ regul@@ ator button to enable the different work areas ( avail@@ able system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) and the cursor keys to make a choice of top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry into another Run@@ level , move it with cutting into the cli@@ p@@ board ( you can also use C@@ tr@@ l ; X use ) and add it to the desired Run@@ level with inser@@ ting ( with C@@ tr@@ l ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sor@@ ting number or the name of a entry manually , press the input button to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to throw the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the danger of the loss of loss , all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ D@@ IR / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they are restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; recovered . changes to preferences are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I have been experimenting with the standard Run@@ le@@ vel@@ n , and now the machine starts constantly anew . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the L@@ ILO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / in@@ it@@ tab and change the default level at a reasonable value ( 3 should usually be fine ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for execution under Run@@ level X , but they will not be executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use &amp; Su@@ SE ( or LD ) , you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual from the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way that system services are started in these distri@@ butions , however , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distri@@ butions , however , does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you use any other distribution : check if all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and also whether they are in the right directory ) . some services ( as &amp; eg . Apache or htt@@ p@@ d ) simply quit without notice , if their configuration files are not available or wrong . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; Run@@ level varies from Distribution to Distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you use any other distribution , please send me information about the run@@ down so that this manual could be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
&quot; to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient , the chapter adaptation of &amp; k@@ user ; to read . &quot;
&quot; after you have made any changes , you must save it . either , use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the entry save in the menu file . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two card cards , the user and user list . for editing , select the desired user or the desired group with a double @-@ click on the entry . it appears the dialog user or group properties . &quot;
&quot; some cart@@ on cards are only displayed when you have advanced system settings ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , if you can make space cards in case you can make individual settings . further cardboard cards appear , if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
the Pass@@ word administration is published in case of shadow @-@ passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d like in BSD Uni@@ xes are installed .
&quot; these cart@@ on card will only appear if for at least one year @-@ in file system space file ( Qu@@ ota ) , and initi@@ alizes ( recognizable by the file rat@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the fil@@ esystem ) . here you can modify parameters for each user , where space restrictions are stored in size : &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limits
card groups informs about the group belonging to the selected user . the standard group that the user belongs to find in the field Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore the user can become a member in other groups by selecting them in the large field .
the dialog features of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group select this user in the list .
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the menu user or group or click the &quot; &quot; Add -@@ button of tool@@ bar . &quot; &quot; the Edit or Dele@@ te of the selected user or the selected group &quot;
&quot; with this module , you can install the L@@ ILO S@@ elec@@ tor , remove and modify the time to the boats of the standard operating system , remove the standard operating system , remove , change , change , change , and more . &quot;
