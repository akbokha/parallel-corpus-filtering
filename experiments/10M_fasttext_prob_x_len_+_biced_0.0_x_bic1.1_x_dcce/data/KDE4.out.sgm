<seg id="407">"this tool opens the same dialog as the handling of raw images. it uses the change and assignment of colour profiles. colour tonate can be performed by the subwindow for the use of color profiles. a detailed guide for the use of color profiles, you can drag the chapter Color Management to Rate."</seg>
<seg id="408">Another important tool is available in the menu under colors of sound correction. this tool provides an integrated way to save multiple color channels at the same time. this is helpful if your camera or your scanner always need the same mistake. this is why you can always find the same correction. in the manual for key correction you will find more information.</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful option to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"& checking came; tool colour effects provides you four colour effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a cant filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing was solar, even Sabatians, an effect that was created when you put an partially developed pressure of a short flash. this had the effect that the lightening areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second lighting. this tool was a part negative of the picture. this tool permits you to jushed this interesting effect."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar-level. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further increase ultimately generates a negativity that does not produce a photopier."</seg>
<seg id="413">"this is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1), and this is adapted (2). the applied intensity is 30%."</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it is different from a saturation that makes him stronger and glatant. try it easy, he embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">"Velvia is the brand name for a natural light-optimized color movie made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for his smooth image structure. Velvias strongly saturated color are also some photographs, especially of which the little landscapes are shown too much."</seg>
<seg id="416">The neonfilter simulates neonlight on the contrasts. the parameter level controls the strength of the outcome and the slider reps the strength of the neonlight. in large images the filter can be the entire CPU for one moment.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not uncommon to change the color contrasting and the luminosity of your photos. you can download the different color peers of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. once you are satisfied with the result use the button labk and you are applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you make a photo with bad weather conditions you can get the reverse issue: a great choice to reduce saturation instead of raising them. all changes you can perform in the preview. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple luminosity / contrast / Gamma is the tool key effect for improving exposure. even if the dialog on this tool acts very complicated, you need for the use in this tool only the area of shooting. concrete the three sliding beneath the histograms."</seg>

<seg id="480">"sharpens is a traditional tool to edge. it is very fast and simple, but generates, especially in dark areas, grained images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask works at the contrast of the edges to look at a picture sharper. actually it's not a bit, it works rather psycho-visual mst. you can use it to remove atmospheric Dunes and it makes a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it's protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocus is possibly the best of the three, as it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adapt."</seg>
<seg id="483">"photos without focus as well as most digital images need a correction of edge. this is because of the digitalization of colors, with only minimum differences to a color point. this in turn leads to a common color together. SLR cameras usually require more retroactively focal than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG-images, a camera has often been applied. pictures in the raw format however must always be damaged during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanner can use a focal filter during the reading of the picture. if you turn off this, you get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get usable results by sharpened a photo with the edge of edge value. that allows you to call the menu entry into operation with the menu.</seg>
<seg id="487">"they should be hereby careful about this, as the results are not very natural: the sharpness increases the edge of edges, but also increases the noise. in general, you will find more information about the menu entry. below Refocus you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to edge."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is crunchy. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than it sharpens. use the tool to mark the menu entry to the menu entry of the Dialot shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp masking is a very good tool to remove veils of your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">"the original image and the preview of the thumbnails will help you edit the picture, showing the output of the filter with the current settings."</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount amplifies the effect. if you make the insharpness mask to strong, become more noise and impression of grading close to sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius shows how many pixels on each side of a channel are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow greater radiology. you should therefore raise pictures of the best in their final resolution.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image one of the original added. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the swelling value is a split from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount. one can thus define a minimum difference between the killing of sharpenes. in this way, areas are avoided with a soft change between the killing of sharpenes and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the unsharp masking filter. the original picture is the (1) and the edited picture the (2). unsharp masking was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a Corpora = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & publication came; tool refocused on a picture by improving the edge. it used to be the copyrighted material-algorithm of Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This tool tries to understand a picture & quot; refocus on the photo; it is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it is using a technique called FIR Vienna Filtering. the traditional technique for depth of pictures is using a sharpness mask. you can start it out of the menu by calling colors Refocus on image processing.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice the circular Faltung works far better than the Gauß'sche fission. the Gauß'sche Faltung has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical outcome also from the source pixel, which is far influenced by the original pixel. that causes unwanted results in most cases."</seg>
<seg id="499">Circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images the default value should set 1 good results. you can bet a higher value if your image is very blurred but then on halves.</seg>
<seg id="500">Correlation: a increase in the correlation can help reduce artefacts. the correlation can be chosen by 0-1. usable values are 0,5 and the values close to 1, & eg. 0,95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharpest effect of the module. "</seg>
<seg id="501">"smoking filter: an increase in the smoking filter can help you reduce artefacts. however, values higher than 0.1%. however, values higher than 0.1%. if the noise filter is too low, the picture quality is very bad. a high value is 0.03. a high value will be added even further."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauß'sche sharpness: this is the radius of the Gauß'sche edge. in most cases, you should use this value in 0 to avoid sensitive artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, so you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matricism: this value determines the size of the Transformationatrix. an increase in matriarch size can produce good results, especially if you choose great values for the circular edge or the palate's edge. note that the module is very slow when you select large values for these parameters. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">Saving as and shop buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocused parameter you have set is thus stored for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all the cuts, color and intention-rectitures on the picture before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the image. the reason for this is that a lot of operations are not visible immediately, but which left unpleasant artifacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read pictures and compress, & eg. as JPEG, you should apply the module to the unzipped image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, unsharp masking produces better results than edge. this could be caused by blurred masking a larger neighborhood than edge."</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp mascot always has to remove artefacts. even under optimal conditions it can never remove the effect of discomfort. for the Vienna filter you can show that it is the optimal linear filter. practical is the result of the FIR Vienna Filters always at least as good as the insharpness mask. the FIR Wiener Filter is often better when handling small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, on a small focused picture, see:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp color picture has to be corrected. this picture was taken with a analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto-focus lens.</seg>

<seg id="516">The algorithm algorithm has been developed by IMAGE Team of the GREC CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different settings as starting points to simplify the restoration. the settings available below are enumerated below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to select the filter preferences from a jushing, you can use the rider smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"Detailed communication [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a similar smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should obtain details so that no alloy is necessary. please note that the amount of details always should be subordinated."</seg>
<seg id="520">"Riding dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value extends evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 only in one direction. in case you have a high value of wavesimilar patterns. JPEG artefacts are best placed near 1 in close proximity to 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"[0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all else. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore, use this value to the degree of smoking in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: these parameters affects larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it becomes smooth, as it is difficult to generate geometry of the picture. even if you want to generate a 'van Gogh's effect effect, it must be higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repetition: returns to how many times the algorithm is going through. usually here 1 or 2 out.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-wide range da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic Alpha. if Alpha is selected, there should also be small chosen. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step-wide [0,1, 10]: integral step towards pixels. you should set the value of small 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never bigger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Linear interpolation use: the more quality that you get through the choice of this option is only minor. he doubles the running time. we therefore highly recommend it.</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons save as and store are exactly this. each setting of images can be correct, saved in a text file and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="528">"graphical errors are comparatively very fast at work. however, it can still take a long time and pull a high CPU load after it. hence, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button downfall."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41), which is used for the filter. large values increase the time that the filters are needed per pixel and can blur the image moving across the image and the color in it is smoothed and thus minor bugs."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the pixelmaker. this value sets the pixels to look forward to detachment. if the value is increased. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer receive and crawling or lubricate again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge-precision for the sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can not remove the entire noise. if you want to remove it on a value close to the maximum if you want to remove an alert noise or JPEG-artifacts without losing details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminosity of the picture. we recommend either to change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color intolerance of the picture. we recommend either to change color or light density to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details -settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the Gammatoleranz of the picture. this value can be used to increase the tolerancillaries of the dark areas, which typically become stronger roughtens, but it disappeared as well the shadow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"absorption: controls the adjustment of the Phasenjitterdamping. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius is responding to variation of the luminance. if it is elevated, the edges, and Phasenjitter appear at the edges. he can remove smoother tips and is the recommended method for this."</seg>
<seg id="542">"saving under and loading: these buttons are used exactly for them. all parameters for the noise reduction, which you have set, can be stored into the filesystem and later loaded."</seg>

<seg id="545">The & publication came; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photographies.</seg>
<seg id="546">"this filter for restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artifacts from your images. it is very well adapted to make Gauß's crawl, film-grains, scratches, compressor and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequent digitized pictures. thus the smoothing takes place along the contours and thereby gets the content as well as the human eye."</seg>

<seg id="1042">"when a picture is saved with only one beam per pixel, there can be different bugs. these images often have a fashion shape or marvel effect in curves and lines, in addition sometimes details are not displayed when they are smaller than a pixel. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to decrease the influence of these errors. generally speaking pictures with this feature are better.</seg>
<seg id="1044">"when you switch anti-aliasing, calculated and connects & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is called super sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super sampling. as standard is an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptive because every pixel is constantly redistributed and adaptive because every pixel is constantly regrouped and adaptive because the recursively depth of calculated color values depend."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray provides a Strahl per pixel. if you set the difference between color values to the neighboring pixels, then both pixels are calculated by pursuing a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the Tieto value on 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated at a depth of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels will be considered: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel. the difference is then:"</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the pre-defined threshold, then the pixel is divided into 4 subdirectories that can be pursued individually and to further subdivision. the maximum depth of recursion can be set with the lowering."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the asing effect is to reduce the production of noise for the beam process, called Jittering. when you switch Jittering, changed & Povray; the blasting to avoid a tiny amount, to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">"the last setting for quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental feature of & Povray; it uses diffuse lightflexion. it takes very long to calculate one scene with this property."</seg>

<seg id="1519">A brief list of parameters to audio-quality and the resulting compression rates for 'lame' (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting results in good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer for most people and most of the music pieces acceptable and has already quite high quality. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and slightly less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. needs more 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for HiFi stereo with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music by young people, portable devices and car stereotypes. but not good enough for better HiFi stereo."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this option will be exaggerated to most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolutely highest quality without regard to file size, then select this attitude."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information which is manually entered or fetched by the program automatically from the freeDB, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / needed with & kaudiocreator; and the code program to create the folder and file names as well as the features of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with code programs, there is often a combination of programs for the encoders and these parameters here. the manual or the help on the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">For example to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: day) to add MP3s with lame must be added to the switches from lame and the title parameter by & kaudiocreator; the result looks as follows: '...-tt {title}...'.</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button labels in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"that is what the freeDB is: a free database, in which people can read the audio CDs instead of input into the computer. it's noted that here only by text is spoken: & CD; title, artists, names of pieces & etc;, not by the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (suppose the author) am not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be added. any information can be given in any bumblebee through a & CD; shop, physically or virtual."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; is active an attachments to choose (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it appears, the email address when retrieving the data from the server did not use (this can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"in many countries, there are copies of the main database. if & kaudiocreator; used for the use of freeDB, the geographically is needed to be used on the next lying mirror. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the machines."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org offers a current list of mirrors for online retrieval of & CD; alternatively you can download the complete database or (normally monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which Outline program is used to save pieces from the & CD; stored in WAV files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; who wants to know more precisely, search in source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CD; see to note that the cdparanoia package must be installed from the appropriate distribution first, if this has not yet been done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the illuminated WAV files, the encoders and therefore the desired file format can be chosen. at first opening there are pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (OGGs) and FLAC (a losure of charge for audio data) on the tabs. other encoders can be added to this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"the coding package must be installed from the specified Linux distribution, before the code can be used. this is also required for the pre-defined code. for more information on Kodiers are found in the chapter World Wide Kodiers."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a code, you can get more information about his switches by entering a command like lame -help or lame --help in a consolenwindow (eg. console). it must be replaced by the name of the installed code."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"this can have many causes. check the decor of the device designation of the & CD; / DVD drives, the writing and reading device of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for OGGs, flac & etc;) installed. try to call both programs with a command line in a terminal. this could give a clue to what is wrong."</seg>
<seg id="1541">"check if you do not want to read a copier-protected audio CD; read the envelope of the & CD, which will not succeed!"</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with one step by step. even if you use other settings, this can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have read the complete manual read everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well yes, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">In this example we will start the program for the first time to set up everything and read our first & CD. we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3v1 keyword (tags).</seg>
<seg id="1545">"you have to be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found for example with a search engine, as it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can naturally always do."</seg>
<seg id="1546">Please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have my cry (eg by trying to copy something) with the conqueror.</seg>
<seg id="1547">The first section covers the basic setting of & kaudiocreator; something which is probably done only once and</seg>
<seg id="1548">The second section describes the procedure to read a & CD; what needs to be repeated for each outgoing & CD.</seg>
<seg id="1549">Here we determine the resulting code for compression of the music (lame) as well as the resulting sound quality (--preset extreme = &gt; VBR 224 to 256 kbps). it is determined where the files are stored and which structure is used. since we are lazy to use the program to download the freeDB and load data from the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will probably not change it on any reading of a CD. change when the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is handed over to the reading programme therefore it can read the & CD; data / pieces can be read.</seg>
<seg id="1552">"frequently / dev / cdrom is a symbolic link to the real device name of your running disk. if this is not working or if more than a & CD; / DVD drive is available, it can also provide a view to the file / etc / fstab and an attempt with the entries of the device awards for the & CD-ROM; and / or DVD drives."</seg>

<seg id="1556">Note: the machine must be available while reading the & CD; connected to the Internet to allow it to access the freeDB server.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"the second selection field is easier, a & CD; entry is found immediately when you are not satisfied with the database entry and the filename / filename or tag entries, they can be changed easily. the directory entry and the ID3 tags with Kid3, the & kde; Tagger."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"apart from this example, we continue to note: if you want to manually enter everything manually, select the selection fields and freeDB is not used. however, these are selected via 620 MB in the offline mode, the two selection fields must be selected, at least the first. the mode is set up on the following cardboard card."</seg>
<seg id="1559">CDDB is for us freeDB. these are settings for data request for retrieving the & CD; information from the freeDB server over the Internet. how does the system know which data is to get the CD? read the section about freeDB.</seg>
<seg id="1560">"mode: we haven't downloaded the database, we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server."</seg>
<seg id="1561">CDDB server: please go to the Fedb.org and look for a mirror server in your vicinity. on this path the load between the machines is distributed. however, this option will work as a first attempt. "</seg>
<seg id="1562">"both function equivalent to the server, because many firewalls will boot the protocol 8880 default, maybe more luck with the protocol 80, since the & HTTP; protocol usually is open to surf the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"in this example, we do not want to transfer any & CD; data to the freeDB server. the first tick-box should be deactivated."</seg>
<seg id="1564">Just take the settings of the screenshot. (make sure the folder / tmp exists on your computer)</seg>
<seg id="1565">"number of simultaneous pieces: apology, there is a reason why more than one simultaneously with just an existing drive? parallel reading and coding? the author does not know it, therefore simply try itself."</seg>

<seg id="1569">"--preset extreme 'defines the audio quality of the MP3s. as previously mentioned earlier, this is a setting for very good audio quality, even for very good HiFi stereo. the resulting bitrate factor is 6.3. this is a good balance between audio quality and storage consumption."</seg>

<seg id="1575">"since we use a & CD which is not yet contained in freeDB, the screen photos show a little different from the data for a & CD; with successfully used by freeDB. therefore, you will learn the & CD; data manually insertion, instead of releasing them from the Internet. comments will indicate the differences."</seg>

<seg id="1661">In this section is indicated as the patches of General MIDI using your specific keyboard. the general usage looks like follows:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the equinox is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches in the right sequence (from 0 to 127), you may not change the order and also no line for one of 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional AllkeysTo M is needed to put all notes that this instrument need to put on the sound with the number M. if your keyboards do not support the gun (GM patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which is similar to a gun tip. to do this, enter the following in the PATCHMAP section:"</seg>
<seg id="1664">"therefore, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with patch 127 (a barrel signal), it takes patch 100 (the Drum on your keyboard) and plays the tone 60, independent of which tone is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that here with the term" "drum patch" "patch, in which each tone represents another Persian document (drum, pelvis, maracas & etc;) and not one who means sound the sound level of the always same drum (like some keyboards)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The KEYMAP section is used to indicate how sounds on a specific channel or instrument are shown.</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the order of lines is very important, as well their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define multiple keymaps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are mainly used to make notes on the perkdisk channel. take a look at as an example the supplied keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to form some channels to others. if you want to exchange for example the first and second channel, simply enter the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards, which have the percussion on a certain channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section therefore has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n's the channel, which is listed on the channel N. if you use keymap option, the keymap will need to use the name name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on this channel. in this case, always patch x uses."</seg>
<seg id="1674">The Forcepatch option can be useful for example to always use the pertinent patch on the perkdisk channel.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderratio indicates which relation to Pitch-Bender-events multiplies with the value n, this with the formula n * (r / 4096) is calculated and then only passed on. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file no decimal number is available)."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM announces that a keyboard, which is supposed to play keyboards with the value 4096, a sound higher. unfortunately, however, try to try some keyboards up to an octave higher. to try the correct value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit using & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the dialog box settings. these can be found in the menu under settings, point MIDI settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The canalview is a window with a whole series of piviatures (one for each MIDI channel). on this piquatures see which sounds are being played straight.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selective list where you can choose an instrument, the button doesn't seem more green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The canalview has (until now) two different views to display the played notes. view in the menu settings at the point of the channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed-LCD shows speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the pace of a song. so if you find e.g., a song is too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the pace, use the arrows left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information on how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, the rhythm, the speed, & etc. therefore, the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results, just like two different musicians play the same notes in a very different way."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"well, I can force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3-file will need 4 MB (a compression rate of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer (a compression rate of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer, you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"that can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; have this happened because & kmid; without awe-support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download a source distribution and install (for example from kmid; 's home)"</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphic tools for the comparisons. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the compilation was very complicated, because one of the contributors had done many changes while at the same time had corrected many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file, and the result was numerous conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I wasn't able to see what exactly changed inside these lines. and there was no evidence of the places where perhaps only the control had changed. that's the result of these changes was a little nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">So that was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within one line and changes to white characters. later on a lot more useful features were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"if you want to compare text quickly, just copy it to the clipboard and add it into one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work was the comparison and result of folders. this function turned & kdiff3, almost into a full-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">Also 3-way merge is fully supported. this is useful when two people are working independently of one piece code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps detect conflict and simultaneously displays the expected results. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three Quell files in the result:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you with the comparisons and merge complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; in case of the folder:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and serve with the possibilities of current color monitors. if you need to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are visible. if lines differ only in a certain number of white signs, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no trouble, if someone changes the backpack.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"when a file is equal, and the other differs in a line, then the color indicate which file is different. red color means both files differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but in different folders, you can ease yourself using the file-work by using only the filenames of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Diffrent 3 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2 Ordre 2</seg>

<seg id="2296">"if merged, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to specify an output file immediately. you can do this step later with saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The insertion button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting with the comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you do not want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to select text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison begins immediately. open-dialog you need to select no files, you can simply shut the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">"you can also drag pulling off and insert: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor, and let it fall over a comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"which idea is behind it? sometimes a file contains e.g. several similar features. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively large effort. you would only need to create two corresponding files, they are in & kdiff3; download and then compare them. now you can copy the relevant sections simply copy, insert and then compare."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you cannot draw anything out of & diff3; only the fall of text in a comparative window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">"warning: some editors interpret the drop and drop of text into another program than cutting and insert (instead of copying and inserting). in such a case, your original data might be lost."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"in the upper part of each text window is the info line. the info-line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the pointer number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Ede Info row has different color. (if the path to a file is too long, the mouse can rest a while on the line. then a small help window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source code is the letters A, B and C assigned. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is recognized, one looks at the color that file is different. (color for conflicts in the settings). color scheme is particularly useful when you compare three files. this is in the next section (bring together) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"links next to the text is the Comprehensive column. when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages, the color is curved, only the relevant changes are not so important, it is useful to only see the relevant changes. (at C / C + + for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for preprocessor and in few, rare items.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line that separates the Comprehensive column from the text, is interrupted on the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the cursor is activated, the line on the broken lines is dotted."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (among the script above) has also a info line with the inscription issue:, the filename and [change] if you have processed the result. usually it contains automatically generated by the automatic, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>

<seg id="2511">"first, you should be aware of which places a mouse click without effect remains: clicking on the neutral components of windows or on places in the browser window, which do not represent a link, does not lead to unwanted responses. you can therefore park the mouse in such places until you want to use them again."</seg>
<seg id="2512">"when your mouse crashes, you should clean your mouse. this is usually pretty simple. the trick is that you not only clean the mouse-ball, but also the roles that come in touch with the mouse-ball."</seg>

<seg id="2516">"this happens when you use & colmousetool; using another window manager, and move a window."</seg>
<seg id="2517">"the solution to this problem is that you can carry out a mouse click. thereby, the status of & kmousetool is reset; and you can work as usual."</seg>
<seg id="2518">"problem: if you enter the text, tries & kmousetool; continue to execute mouse clicks and sets the cursor to another position."</seg>

<seg id="2522">"do not use the intelligent relocating if you just start using & kmousetool; mark the text instead, follow the cursor button down, while you move the cursor to the other end of the text and then pressing the mouse button again."</seg>

<seg id="2956">Welcome to the & kde; system V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv; this section leads to a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv. "</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the System V Init rapidly develops into the standard for control of the program boot when driving the system into the & Linux; this is why it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD Init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go here further on historical aspects (e.g. because I know nothing about it: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is below / sbin and not under / etc. this is therefore important because maybe someone could try to switch a machine to System V Init without a new installation and re-format. therefore, you must ensure that the old Init was removed from there in case there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">The SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files in a subfolder of / etc are located directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort you will find rc.sysinit and the following additional folder:</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for each system service that you want to start driving on the system or change to another runlevel. system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setbacks, which will only be started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"partly under / etc / rc.d, if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is actually not much use for it. you can also want to run a rc.c. in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel is looking for different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default level level is in / etc / inittab. you should be in the initial area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column, and probably notice that the pre-presented Runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can fix it carefully by restart the system and perform the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the right scripts? if you enter serl in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no right files. instead, each entry here is a shortcut to one of the scripts in the directory init.d."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how starts and stops init actually system services? very simple: each of the scripts is written so it is a argument like start and stop accepted. you can actually start this scripts, from hand on the command line:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and when the K involves, the script will be called with the argument stop. if he is a S, the script is called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people wish to set up a simple way of setting machines for many purposes. I could have & eg. a server running level, that leaves just httpd, & Sendmail;, network & etc. also, I could also have a user running level, the & eg., network & etc; starts."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn the use of & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointer is easy to not say: draw an entry from the area of Available system services on one of the six rundown to start it at that level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within one level by using it somewhere else. this will only happen if they pick an entry from the area of Available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries will be moved, when you drag them into a new area. to select it only on a new rundown menu, you must explicitly select copying from the Edit menu or from the context menu and even if the same entry has previously existed in the target area of action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of a entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you have to edit the number of items of the surrounding entries before you again try to add the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"note: currently there is no way to restore items that were thrown into the trash. so be careful."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabregulator button to enable the different work areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) and the cursor keys to make a choice of top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry into another Runlevel, move it with cutting into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X use) and add it to the desired Runlevel with inserting (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of a entry manually, press the input button to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to throw the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the danger of the loss of loss, all entries in the menu file require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they are restored by & ksysv; recovered. changes to preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I have been experimenting with the standard Runleveln, and now the machine starts constantly anew. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input button to start in single user mode. then edit the file / etc / inittab and change the default level at a reasonable value (3 should usually be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for execution under Runlevel X, but they will not be executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use & SuSE (or LD), you will need to edit additional files in / etc that are available only in these distributions. please read the details in the manual from the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way that system services are started in these distributions, however, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary installation programs of these distributions, however, does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you use any other distribution: check if all configuration files are available, which are required by the respective system service (and also whether they are in the right directory). some services (as & eg. Apache or httpd) simply quit without notice, if their configuration files are not available or wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; Runlevel varies from Distribution to Distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you use any other distribution, please send me information about the rundown so that this manual could be added."</seg>
