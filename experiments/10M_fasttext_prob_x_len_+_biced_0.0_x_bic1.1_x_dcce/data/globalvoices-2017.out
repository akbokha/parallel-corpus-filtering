although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extremely big .
&quot; as many of my generation I have grown up with American films , I have danced with American music , American authors and operated his sports . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had a profound impact on me , that I was mainly a journalist for an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gray Gran@@ th@@ am in The pel@@ ican letter , who covered with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts as Jura @-@ Stu@@ ed the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil mag@@ nat@@ es who wanted to be inclined to his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free after Meth@@ od Man , &quot; &quot; I was , as if that is absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year that I lived in Arizona , had only strengthened my admir@@ ation for the USA . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about his size .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the xen@@ ophobia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow @-@ minded .
he never holds up with his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it , and explains publicly his cont@@ emp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ ina , Af@@ ro@@ American and Women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in she@@ ers for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes that he won in the Republi@@ can pres@@ election , was the highest number one ever achieved by the party candidate . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ illa person , I asked me ? &quot;
I could not put Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the journalist programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deep super@@ sti@@ tious person , with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; the m@@ umps of world@@ view not coinci@@ de with the Peter Bh@@ atia , the current editor of the &quot; C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ qu@@ ir@@ er . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Bh@@ atia and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps In@@ firm@@ ness is also in contrast to the generosity that I have experienced in Sandy B@@ ahr , fighting for their lives long , and her husband Dave , my host family who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she is still adapting to the dedication of Krist@@ i K@@ app@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace , and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Lec@@ tur@@ key , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wis@@ er council has helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the em@@ bodied in them em@@ bodied my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump received his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans , mostly white , the presidency of a man , despite or perhaps because of its cont@@ emp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the debate with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump because they either shared its racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were ready to miss these things , broke me almost the heart . &quot;
maybe it is unfair to call the Tr@@ ump @-@ voters as rac@@ ists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy the people , said one of my friends , is exactly what has led us to this situation . &quot;
that is superficial and dis@@ respectful and points an in@@ ability to understand those who act in a different way and think .
it shows people that their worries and fears about the h@@ ectic changes in their communities are not considered .
&quot; could it be that these voters , of which are most white , voted for Tr@@ ump , because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in America ? &quot;
maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comm@@ enting the cruel decision to elev@@ ate a man who look down with cont@@ emp@@ t to those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; &quot; ( C@@ m. ) : much like &quot; En@@ ten@@ dence of the Wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cs &quot; ; &quot; words from white to the White and whi@@ plas@@ h , which means as much as Sch@@ leu@@ der@@ trau@@ ma ) , as it was called the great Van Jones , exactly what America has done so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it &apos;s still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you might have , America is every welcome . &quot;
&quot; for this land chose as his president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ ers whose history , as he himself says , nowhere else in the world would be possible . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tr@@ umps , there is a huge part of the white Americas , and says : to Hell with Vari@@ ety , Religi@@ ous Freedom and the whole concept of plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the rod , they say . &quot;
&quot; for all this I have to think about K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fallen in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; at a rally for Hill@@ ary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , had a place in your America ? &quot; I asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
&quot; the crowd answered with a sil@@ ently &quot; &quot; No ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; could Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; br@@ anded the quantity .
&quot; do Lat@@ ina have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; &quot; we rep@@ lied . &quot;
do A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they called them and their voices became lou@@ der .
&quot; could anyone who is not like you , a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a single @-@ vote and vo@@ iced &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan made with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot;
&quot; the land , for which his son fell , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now tr@@ umps of land , &quot; said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could no longer find place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children can not spoil their love for music by trash

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the par@@ agu@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music that is played in both places , not only the life of the children , but also a very close link with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump ; only 16 Kilom@@ eters south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen .
&quot; for several years now , La B@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ Ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : one from children and adults with an existing sym@@ ph@@ ony orchestra , which has found a possibility to overcome them with their music @-@ instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico , is known for its drugs abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope of hope . &quot;
&quot; the young band@@ members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , means the local press not@@ ci@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; once they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to go to their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come up with gle@@ aming eyes and play in the Tru@@ bel you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ colo , clar@@ inet , O@@ bo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ gos and the Con@@ ga . &quot;
music from garbage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are playing the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village , which is practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recovered waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with recovered instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where recycled - under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the waste . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ating , viol@@ a , c@@ elli , double b@@ asses , guit@@ ars , flute , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones , tro@@ mb@@ ones and perc@@ ussion , all produced out of the trash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire comprises classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of The Beatles , from Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez remembers a local en@@ ologist and musician instructor for the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , at the beginning of the time : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ s@@ als and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
that changed as F@@ avi@@ o something was shown what he had never seen before : one of waste performed violin .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra which plays material from recovered material and which the recycled Orchestra is called . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) draws the musical performance to :
the world produces about one billion tons of trash each year .
those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura . Paraguay .
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with his inspir@@ ational spectacle from trash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra has even played his music from Pope Francis :
these eastern African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fought wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reported on international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
re @-@ publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , at that time , it was known that this ship had already hosted illegal fishing water before it was looking for the other coast of Africa . &quot;
&quot; the eastern African countries were accordingly dark , and is little inclined to welcome a legislative fr@@ inge of this kind at their coasts . &quot;
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ or@@ os , Moz@@ ambi@@ que and the Seychelles mobil@@ ised themselves quickly against the ship . they refused to bapti@@ ze one of their har@@ bours and refused to place him an old fishing trip . &quot;
&quot; &quot; Ur@@ suddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you just refused , &quot; &quot; Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a leader of the Ken@@ yan fisher@@ man &apos;s office . he is part of a team who discovered the ship at the time and followed . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to pl@@ undering of fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; at the heart of this initiative , the criminal practices crossed and resources protection was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the N@@ RO Stop illegal F@@ ishing ( Il@@ legal fisheries ) . &quot;
the members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the Premier from their waters .
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries who are like minded and working together . they exchange information and stand each other where there is illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable trust project En@@ ding illegal F@@ ishing . this project has F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught , is hidden because of it &apos;s extremely difficult to divide . therefore , illegal fishing is a leading cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by inten@@ tional dis@@ respect of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm , which have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; while actions against illegal fishing were once handic@@ apped by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les , and also through the snow @-@ emp@@ o , with the information between individual countries , so the actions occurred today in real time , with tr@@ ack@@ able to F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there , the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses , news on suspected activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i pursu@@ es the activities of ships also very attentive , if they are moving across the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
&quot; this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in bot@@ any areas . also allow such suspi@@ cious routes to discover , such that a ship invites its fish onto other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly , whether they have a criminal record . &quot;
&quot; countries who are against illegal fishing may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports , which means that the ships could not sell their cargo . and that they may even be forced to be forced by pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is then a significant financial loss for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is not worth more financially . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says Per Erik Ber@@ gh , leader Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
the already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover that the eight members of the Network H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i lose each year due to illegal fisher@@ man who penetrate into East African waters .
East Africa has one of the most productive t@@ una fishing plants that attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world . among these also those illi@@ cit fishermen .
&quot; such activities include actions like sailing under false flag , counterf@@ eit licence papers , indication of fanta@@ sies , the fish protected species and the fish in nature reserve . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they util@@ ise the missing international co @-@ operation and make up the weaknesses of a not incomplete control system , &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; previously , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; you dar@@ ed to walk my port . &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &quot; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
so far the closed front works .
since its foundation F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i was involved in more than 30 investigations into susp@@ ects .
&quot; it has been exposed criminal networks to spread counterf@@ eit licenses in Tanzania . it discovered vessels that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has tr@@ acked ships and found it . &quot;
&quot; based on his collaboration with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority for fighting crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i information can share information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organised crime , &quot; said Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system , which is supposed to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to lay down ships accurately . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is always developed further , also helps to trace the illegal ships that are happy to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal fishing use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , boss analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ g@@ g M@@ at tracking , an NGO that also deals with fishing data and F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems , so that they can no longer be Georgian . &quot;
&quot; Cop@@ eland helps to build a system , which combines different information levels . it aims to help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has recently opened the Global F@@ ishing Watch platform : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world by means of the position of each pro@@ trac@@ eable ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who knows where - that is simply meaning , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run , in which a global system permits the persecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities can not only feel criminals , but they also deter@@ red . &quot;
&quot; ships who had formerly over@@ exploited and hardly expected with consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have now submitted a 33 % increase in fisher@@ y sales , since fisher@@ man boats more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Somalia had helped to record Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tu@@ pp@@ ets whose use is forbidden . &quot;
photo with friendly permission of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice this success . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; in West Africa , several hundred million dollars van@@ ish each year by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 six countries have joined together , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . also , they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with certainty the aim of making even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions , &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s youngest member country would announce his first big triumph : in October there was Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship which was under wrong flag . and not just the ship was also used without a license and were to@@ wing machine used by now . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also penetr@@ ated in the bot@@ tled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with taking action against Gre@@ ko 1 set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time proof that such a special , collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea .

&quot; their articles appear in the Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela belongs to : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of cap@@ turing the country &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be only the beginning of a wave of fierce demonstrations .
&quot; they are regarded as a protest against the decision of the government , to stop the referendum of the President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . &quot;

&quot; after the government of Venezuela had rejected the application of the opposition to a referendum for the ministers , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted , in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country had gone into the void , while they were gathered in the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about : the recovery of Venezuela ) can be found both from these demonstrations as well as arguments for and against them .
&quot; the debate is also managed in other parts of the country - among other things in the territory of Bar@@ inas , in the region @-@ regions of MÃ©@@ rida and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north @-@ lying Par@@ a@@ at Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on the Isla Margar@@ ita in the federal state Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which makes itself noticeable in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through a acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition have blocked the chance of basic change in the ministers of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro . ultimately , the post@@ ure of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , co @-@ acting with Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ed up the context of the current state of government in her latest article : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , in which the inflation and powers of violence belong to the highest parts of the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ sufficient lack of food and medicine , the referendum was to seize the opportunity to regain its institutional structures and to establish a new government alliance . &quot;

the call was commented on Twitter as follows :

&quot; on Twitter skins images , which relate to disputes , as well as reports of repression and abuse . &quot;
&quot; particularly large waves , the news about police @-@ state repression in the central @-@ north @-@ located town of Marac@@ ay . &quot;
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators returned to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves from the government &apos;s own statement , before the police and the armed advoc@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; hours later , they were able to leave the cathedral again , but the protests went further . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some prot@@ esters were trying to stop police forces , including those women in the An@@ den@@ state T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear rub@@ bing , because otherwise you could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers don &apos;t have ! &quot;
meanwhile a Info@@ graphic is already taking a round about the scale of repression per day :
&quot; thus , the dictatorship has sup@@ pressed the land . &quot;
many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a minister of Ministers - this was now demonstrated in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the streets .
My@@ te@@ ks Media Labs in addition :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dad@@ o assert that 1 % of the sig@@ natures are fake .

&quot; &quot; &quot; others share these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and pre@@ occupied itself to let critical voices are pet@@ ri@@ fied : &quot;
you have taken us so much - but also the fear !

the interview was translated into English and will be published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ in@@ ean city CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as by now , he said Qui@@ j@@ ano in the context of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process in the province of CÃ³rdoba , against his father . &quot;
&quot; in the trial that ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes were investigated during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano has not picked up his life .
&quot; beginning with the office to carry the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in the prison La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he has suffered enough . &quot;
34 years later he held the family of the family .
in the situation then I believed that was in order .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child of 15 years , one does not notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time , I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , fo@@ terer and mur@@ der@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was genocide . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship of 1974 till 1983 , a time of State Department , his father from 1976 to 1978 Deputy Chairman of the Secret Department , 141 in the prison La Per@@ la . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the op@@ pres@@ sor , who is charged with kidn@@ apping in 15@@ 8 cases , torture , murder in nearly 100 cases and the ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os son , a man who had experienced the extent of the atro@@ cities that he had experienced as a boy , and who spoke before a Bundes@@ tribunal against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , which great power has a parent about his child , and how this child chose a way of redemption . &quot;
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us into the sports hall . there I was rounded with a boy , the martial arts . &quot;
&quot; they called him &quot; &quot; K@@ ent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I told my father of him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo , and called me to identify my friend . &quot;
he said :
&quot; you are an ass hole , you have made you friends with an ERP . &quot;
pass just that they will not dec@@ eive you one day and I then have to save you .
the abbrevi@@ ation ERP stands for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolution@@ ary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Revolution@@ ary Workers &apos; Party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he offered me to go back to the sports hall . some days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he said to me , I would become a secret . &quot;
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be ok . for that my father had brought me up . &quot;
at the military base I had to destroy papers that had heard the prisoners .
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; there , the prisoners are tor@@ tured &quot;
my father took me a total of four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
&quot; during the first time and last time , he let me wait for the entrance in the car . &quot;
&quot; when he took me the second time he commanded me to rise up . he led me to a bar@@ ac@@ ke , in the cars , furniture , television , fri@@ dges - just everything possible . &quot;
everything about it was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little wrapped in a blan@@ ket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a great cl@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the Bar@@ ac@@ ke , where the stolen objects were cut down , and taught me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
&quot; then , the prisoners are tor@@ tured . &quot;
&quot; I sp@@ ed in , and saw a couch , on which people were tor@@ tured . &quot;
it looked like a dirt bed and metal @-@ feathers .
later I found out that they attached to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person that was just captiv@@ ated there .
&quot; they rarely solidi@@ fy a man with hand@@ hel@@ m to the bed , sle@@ w him with water and j@@ ailed him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch was in there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later , when my father stood under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for a man to do so much suffering from another ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; I knew that these people were killed &quot;
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he brought me to the entrance of La cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were captiv@@ ated with palms and were dis@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian ) who was also charged in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a set of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were captiv@@ ated by hands and feet .
near the entrance cau@@ li@@ zed people quietly on the mattresses .
&quot; when my father noted that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; What gu@@ ck@@ est thou such , ha@@ st@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I escaped &quot; &quot; Why have you otherwise brought myself down ? &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were cast into a pit and were killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told home about it .
beside La cu@@ ad@@ ra were some rooms that were called the offices .
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero found a man and killed .
&quot; according to the survivors of the &quot; &quot; Jorge Rom@@ ero &quot; , &quot; the Jorge Rom@@ ero who was also charged at La Per@@ la Ri@@ ber@@ a process , the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the head of the memorial La Per@@ la , by the former Fol@@ ders chambers . &quot;
&quot; the way you came in here is also the way , in which the kidn@@ apped came here . &quot;
&quot; look at the map , see that they took about this way and then were tor@@ tured for the first time . &quot;
here their names have changed and they got a number assigned as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization .
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into cu@@ ad@@ ra until the arrangement of the above came that they should be laid . &quot;
&quot; this was the lie , the Euph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their cor@@ p@@ ses in most cases . &quot;
the &apos; war &apos; of war &apos;
my father brought all the possible things to come home .
&quot; at that time in the age I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war &quot; &quot; - how they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was later at the military , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - I realized that war was a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps a military sign that one takes to an enemy which one fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and let the fridge , the record player , clothing , paintings , money ... sti@@ ckers , then this is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is rob@@ bery .
&quot; I have always asked myself how my father , the head of security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand it .
I was also officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never really like to penetrate into a house and ste@@ al everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a crime , and I said , And thou that thou shou@@ ld@@ est take cars on the road ? &quot;
you are not a crime ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in fur@@ y , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; when you go so far , then I will find you and bring you hanging . &quot;
we do not need any other one !
that was my father .
I have no only good memory of him .
&quot; when I told in the process , I showed a photo of back on which I took a jacket and a sco@@ op pul@@ lover made of wool . both my father had from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he also brought clothes with me . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence , a conspir@@ ation had been accused of being in this crime . I resist , no problem , they can lay down my burden on what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to pre@@ dict .
&apos;@@ Rem@@ ove of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act
&quot; now , where I am older I find Re@@ mor@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; I have children . if you only have children , one recognizes the value of a life . &quot;
develops further and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have ex@@ cre@@ ted to people during the dictatorship . but what the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why to run children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl with his home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tor@@ tured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
it simply could have been put into prison .
I guess it was simply chosen to kill these people . but what their cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not also have families who were able to pass their mortal remn@@ ants ?
the prescri@@ bing of the body is the last ab@@ omin@@ able act that man can do with a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machinery to eliminate the remains of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were ex@@ hor@@ ted and somewhere ent@@ ailed - no idea where . &quot; you will never find something &quot; , &quot; my father said . &quot;
but something is of course still .
&quot; I have seen how you killed people ! &apos;
just to clarify it : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my Father .
&quot; the thought , showing my father , was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
&quot; I made him accus@@ ations because of all the atro@@ cities , which I had to experience with him . &quot;
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; I don &apos;t know . I have not killed anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt deeply rep@@ lied and asked me to what the whole exagger@@ ated patriot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I shou@@ ted :
how can you tell me what to tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he ref@@ uted only &quot; &quot; Well , please forgive me . &quot;
exactly this did I do .
in 2010 I generated the first ad .
&quot; &quot; &quot; I had finally recognized that he was a criminal . &quot;
nobody can blame me that I was taken . I finally told my own father .

&quot; translation errors will make older people in Kyoto to &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;

edited of the original photos by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend his driving licence , last month witnesses a particularly mis@@ bl@@ iss@@ ful translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign@@ post the Japanese word , which means the &apos; older motor@@ ists &apos; , mistak@@ enly - but perhaps also with arches rear &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from the 1st to 20th of September on electronic advertisements in the entrance area and in the building itself .
the work of the original photos of Joshua Lev@@ ine that was often shared in the social media .
&quot; the error was the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could it come to such an English translation ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an ins@@ ult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the faul@@ ty English translation was initially removed . the name &quot; &quot; said &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; terrible drivers &quot; ) was later replaced by the pre@@ emp@@ t@@ iness , although gram@@ mati@@ cally is not quite correct term &quot; El@@ ders &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police in Kyoto apologi@@ ze for the translation errors . furthermore , they explained that the error was already included in the text which they had received by the translator and that the translation has not been checked for correctness . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincere , that older people felt by insufficient correction ( the translation ) of our part , &quot; &quot; said the Police . &quot;
the Japanese online syndic@@ ate J @-@ Cast News made a little more detailed with the phenomenon of &quot; terrible &quot; senior drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; terri@@ bly &quot; was de@@ ple@@ xed as an adequate description of older motor@@ ists . according to the police , the proportion of older drivers who are involved in accidents , but are quite a reason to worry . &quot;
&quot; in Kyoto , for example , in 2005 1.@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19.@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by seniors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , seniors recovered 1.@@ 8@@ 03 of a total of 11.@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; with this , your share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased in total , the proportion of the accidents caused by the elderly have risen in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ porter has not brought comments to light in the published version of article Comments to the light , which show which prejudices some Japanese seem seemingly against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo on the translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
- &quot; Is this ( &quot; awesome driver &quot; ) about not the reality ?
&quot; - If faul@@ ty the translation actually is not , or ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that is a true translation failure . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread in Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and across Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a true source of discovery for these bizarre bugs in English .
photo of Flickr users Andrew .
the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to transition , one requires two important abilities : passive language skills to understand the starting text and to active language skills to transfer him to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case in maternity language . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language - are not in the primary language - native speaker . &quot;
so a French native language should translate from English into French - not from French to English .
photo by Flickr users Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a native language to produce the translations into English . this may be mis@@ understood to understand the reasons , reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers , the Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who even have no foreign employees , do not allow translations to make company @-@ internal . then the Japanese staff , whose English skills are trained as the best to be trained as the best possible to become translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;

machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results .
&quot; the contaminated and en@@ ig@@ matic assemblies that are created by machine translation , show that this technology will not yet be replaced by human translators for a long time . &quot;
&quot; some of the strange English formulations in Japan , including the pu@@ zz@@ ling prints , which often used T @-@ shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo of Flickr users Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless at least . but , by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards , you can be careful translations . &quot;
Kyoto will hopefully use a serious source for their translations in the future .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ ored measures on the Internet and television
main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ eg@@ ar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free Adventure ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ ed@@ ad , Institute of Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ elan Internet users , that they could not have access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay V@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
later other users wrote that the internet pres@@ ences of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Capit@@ o@@ lio TV was no longer accessible .
&quot; other on @-@ line stations exceeded recordings of protests in Car@@ acas , which were organized by op@@ position@@ ists who res@@ ists the government Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court broken the parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author on Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a Trac@@ er@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection is folded and recommended the user , VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites ven@@ ez@@ ol@@ an@@ ese providers are again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Vene@@ zol@@ ans , especially in times of distur@@ ban@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been hesit@@ ant since 2014 during the reporting of protests . at that time , the Commission voted for it with money and locker when they continue to report on demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
without cable TV and informative national television channels I signed up again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net .
&quot; surprisingly , that this is still cheaper than to buy two lit@@ re of le@@ mon@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ IT fil@@ tro confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay has been in@@ accessible by a block@@ age of the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two further online stations . this also concerns the website that the National Assembly transfers its meetings . &quot;
&quot; earlier im@@ itations of the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , we had to make use of local Internet provider . this is a technique , through which the DNS server needs to respond to certain domains . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server responds faul@@ ty or denied the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , transferred to the transfer on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman Elvis Flor@@ es , who transferred live the protests in Car@@ acas . &quot;
Flor@@ es was be@@ aten while he was in custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went back to broadcast again .
&quot; although some channels are accessible via YouTube , it was also reported that the Government regul@@ ates the Internet connections : thus , the Venezu@@ el@@ ers access to multi @-@ media coverage over the current events in the country are becoming increasingly difficult . &quot;
in Paraguay many girls are becoming a slave to receive an education
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was as a child a cri@@ adi@@ ta . now she visits the house in which she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and g@@ athers testimony of other Cri@@ adi@@ s who were exactly the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated version of a report issued by curator , published by Global Vo@@ ices with friendly permission of the authors . &quot;
&quot; the article is part of a series titled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ elan , es@@ cu@@ elas que Ca@@ en &quot; &quot; ( &quot; F@@ lying cows , dec@@ aying schools &quot; ) , edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household , in which they did not live together with the family who lived there . &quot;
shortly before gradu@@ ation at the university she returned once again into the house and heard how the owner of the house full of pride about them spoke . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; those , from which has become something , &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated in this house like a daughter .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ ta , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money exceeds her minor son or her under@@ age daughter to another , richer family . in exchange keeps the child food , a training and a roof over your head . &quot;
&quot; however , what is not mentioned here is that the children need to pay countless days of house@@ work that can never be paid and to victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that you cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; this practice referred to as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , Paraguay is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite many many cases of human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing their studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization that &apos;s fighting for the rights of the boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , she spoke to Cri@@ adi@@ ta - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - gathered testimonials , researched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; they tried to call things in the name , for the feeling of gratitude that is vacc@@ inated by cri@@ mp , is generally down@@ hearted . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family , who take their daughter in their belief that they will complete their education to improve their position in society and who can &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who takes up the girl in himself and justi@@ fies its exploitation by faith that they would never give someone an opportunity for anyone who would otherwise have no education and might even be star@@ ving . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; if the girl is mis@@ ed , his family will only experience many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the formerly quite unknown phenomenon , which takes place in secret in par@@ agu@@ an households , but a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of intense strikes . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was Cri@@ adi@@ ta in the household of the former Military Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a be@@ amer at the local population .
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived in her house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small village with only 3,000 inhabitants located 250 km east of the capital As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ re@@ ira struck as long as with a stick in Mar@@ Ã­n until they suffered fatal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
some days later the media reported about the incident .
stres@@ sing that the murdered child was a cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UNICEF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made deeply rooted in the par@@ agu@@ an Society &apos;s practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go for the death of the girl .
they marked the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest leaders and called that there is &quot; no other Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widespread in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay are more cows registered as children , &quot; said Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to violate the rights of children .
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control , under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbors of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a rapid investigation of the case .
they want to be Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ re@@ ira and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ adi@@ ta to be sentenced to 30 years imprisonment .
&quot; when the case comes to judgment , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n , could be the case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go to judgment for the first time in the history of Paraguay . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; crimes are exploited not only as labour force , they also live isolated from other girls in their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k worked as the Far@@ bi@@ k , who worked her father , who lost her course and lost her father his work . &quot;
their brothers had to go all work now and started to sell on the streets or on the sweets to earn money .
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ on to the capital As@@ unci@@ on .
in the house of their employer Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day .
&quot; at the same time , they had to split the time so that you still have time to learn . &quot;
she stood up in the morning against five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for their employers .
&quot; happy for example , puri@@ fied the fridge , puri@@ fied the living room , polished the furniture and des@@ infected the ground . &quot;
&quot; when the school was finished , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the sooner it was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
&quot; but that time was limited , because they had even had dinner for their employers . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says it had never had to go hungry , but did not get unlimited food . &quot; I could catch more books from the house library than eating from the refrigerator , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and was included in the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party , which was in power during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings of the Hou@@ ses of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , next to him stand and editorial from Op@@ position@@ ings such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ dero &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to persu@@ ade them to give no faith to the official media reports on the regime of the dict@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; he held her not for intelligent , but did not keep him with her . &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who spoke , while he sp@@ ake about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
they allowed me not often to visit my family because they were the opinion that I would go there again &quot; bad habit . &quot; that said they that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a belongs to the Indi@@ genous group of the Guaran@@ i would be back home again their native Guaran@@ i .
&quot; their Lord feared that they had the education , that they had enabled them to lose again , explain them . &quot;
&quot; it was absolutely clear , however , that they did for everything they got from them , with their hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a is discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing that is almost never spoken about , Mob@@ bing and the ra@@ ils are exposed to school when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognize that anyone who has no parents , a cri@@ adi@@ ta is . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to invite my home . I had no friends in school or neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in time , where friend@@ ships arise , I particularly notic@@ e@@ ably that I was not part of any group . &quot;
&quot; the insulation was the worst of everything , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the company recognizes the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman released the following text in a Facebook group where you can share vac@@ ancies for clean@@ ers and c@@ anny in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administration of the group is PE@@ PA Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city carrier in the district of As@@ unci@@ on . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
learning .
please log in .
start from Monday if possible .
the ad got five &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had a miserable girl and gave their phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came out of Ã@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes little children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; the third comment was written by &quot; &quot; a girl from the country &apos;s inner , which I want to work &quot; . &quot; &quot;
then the fibers in the display once again become a :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I look forward to whether it works with her . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again if something is . &quot;
the store was complete .
&quot; in the pro@@ log to the report Cri@@ adi@@ ta , Â¿ H@@ ast@@ a cu@@ Ã¡n@@ do , &quot;
&quot; ( Cri@@ adi@@ ta , how long yet ? ) , a collection of testimonies of former Cri@@ adi@@ ta , writes Or@@ ti@@ z : &quot;
&quot; in the course of our history we managed to manage systems such as slavery , Cu@@ Ã±@@ ad@@ az@@ go ( a practice from the pre@@ fecture of Paraguay ) , and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the workers had conquered toll and their &quot; wives , &quot; ) , and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the worker ) had paid tribute to them , and the natives of the Men@@ s@@ Ãº ( in which the worker ) had paid tribute to them , that many girls and boys moved to a system of slavery during which they are light victims of abuse and exploitation . &quot;
the social inequality in Paraguay and the vision of power is the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill draft of Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian elections recently voted &quot; draft &quot; to the regulations regarding the use and usability of social networks .
&quot; when he is adopted by the Parliament , beneficiaries , and users of social media have to register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media , including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established in order to give citizens a permit to place social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of adopting the law , beneficiaries and users must register on the site of the site with their correct name and human resource numbers to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; will it miss this to do so , this could be a penalty of up to six months in jail or a money @-@ bu@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; the bill introduced which consists of six par@@ don@@ ors and in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defined social media as &quot; any application that runs through the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video calls and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when the design cannot be assumed , as Egyptian authorities work on the registration process . it is uncertain how the Egyptian government is not able to sign up for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ du@@ l Satt@@ ar , MPs and sponsors of the legislative situation , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users and users received a username and password to get through the fire@@ wall , the Facebook blocks . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to set a fire@@ wall on national level all around Facebook . because of which , it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not yet known that such plans exist .
experts from the site are scep@@ tical regarding the technical fe@@ asi@@ bility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research @-@ related drugs &quot; ) the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , &quot;
I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they did so for@@ ci@@ bly physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; when I take it seriously , then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to request citizens who request a permit or not . and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; &quot; &quot; to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legis@@ lat@@ ure of parliament and constitutional committees , before it enters into the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not , the design is consistent with a pro @-@ military thinking of the parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ised and safegu@@ ar@@ ded that no ab@@ err@@ ation of scar on the image is present , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the MPs called Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ ha@@ wy established a legislative situation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence for those was destined to threaten the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how an Kurdish natur@@ alist of the Persian leop@@ ards protects the Persian Leop@@ ards in the war in Iraq

&quot; this contribution of To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was published in the original at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . this contribution is published here as part of an agreement on content sharing . &quot;
high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the northeast of Iraq do work with animal @-@ based H@@ ana Ahmed R@@ aza and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq to protect the gh@@ ost Persian leop@@ ards .
&quot; a sub@@ type of the larger family of leop@@ ards , which extends through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian Leop@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sa@@ x@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are found due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they are always less prey . &quot;
why is this particular type of leop@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as R@@ aza shows in the video , the Persian leop@@ ard is the only remaining rob@@ bery in the Kurdish ecosystem , and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem will also depend on the fact that a big car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es exists . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian Leop@@ ards actually in the free wild , is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video ensures that they have a shot of a big cat at camera all , R@@ aza breaks in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a trained Bi@@ olog@@ in , R@@ aza is passionate about a different side of their country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in trials studies on wild animals and education programs by Nature Iraq for six years .
it has also been a member of IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to setting protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdistan region .
&quot; Sebastian Meyer , an award @-@ winning photographer and film@@ makers , has produced this video for si@@ sia . &quot;

&quot; in early March 2017 , Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o documented the progress made in the last six years in order to re @-@ rebuild the lives of those who had been hit by the &quot; triple catastrophe &quot; of March 2011 . a major earthquake , a Tsun@@ ami and a nuclear accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hima had triggered a disaster . &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ da@@ i , which is in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ fecture , the Pre@@ fecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was a et@@ in@@ pre@@ fecture in Japan &apos;s northeast who had both experience the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
&quot; hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring @-@ not@@ ations of Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to depart from the country of the ts@@ un@@ ami , because the ts@@ un@@ ami had a whole coastal cities disappear from the map . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , the Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture experienced a nuclear accident - already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses . &quot;
the special report of the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from a local point of view which advances the progress six years afterwards to rebuild the life of the local residents .
the detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves .
&quot; housing construction at Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reported that by December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses ( in the context of this event , so@@ ig@@ ai k@@ ou@@ ei ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) were completed in the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the biggest success among the three pre@@ fec@@ tures could see Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of these houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hima has 70 percent of the final light . &quot;
&quot; however , one is still trying to res@@ ett@@ led six years after the disaster , ev@@ acu@@ ated from Beh@@ el@@ fs@@ ac@@ elle ( in the context of the &quot; &quot; Kaz@@ ak@@ su Ju@@ go@@ ak@@ u ) &quot; &quot; into final sub@@ houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hima and I@@ w@@ ate in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of 2011 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i has been more successful . more than 75 percent of the ev@@ acu@@ ated shel@@ ters , which were taken after the disaster in the homes of accommodation , were settled in final houses . &quot;
for I@@ w@@ ate the number is here at 34 per cent .
the state of works and daily life in the three affected cases .
&quot; as the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to determine 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , which were affected by evil , their doors to December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ fec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; six years later , industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures are far more difficult . &quot;
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fisher@@ y in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i have been in operation again , at Fu@@ kus@@ hima only 30 percent of the fisher@@ y were re @-@ recorded their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , have raised in the three pre@@ fec@@ tures of agricultural land in co @-@ passion@@ ately . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hima . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed arable lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hima , are located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ect of the pre@@ fec@@ tures , tourism has recovered further again , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hima still remains un@@ stable . &quot;
the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hima still can only have 75 percent here .
&quot; however , the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reported that since the disaster nearly half of the coast @-@ inhabitants , it became more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population being prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; to be able to determine an overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and among the ev@@ acu@@ ated ones . she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how their rebellion have changed over the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
in the introduction of the article the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper explains :
the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o introduced a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the local people in experience .
&quot; the survey conducted that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ate prevention was done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima pre@@ fecture
in its edition about the anniversary of the earthquake the Ka@@ ho@@ ku Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the position of the ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima .
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hima still had to experience the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , the pre@@ fecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hima was also a witness of the worst , disaster relief , atom@@ an accident that had ever had to experience in Japan . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 ev@@ acu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hima , nearly 63 000 people were reported in areas outside of the pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in early 2016 , some more than 23 000 people have been converted back to Fu@@ kus@@ hima , in permanent spare parts . &quot;
&quot; according to the state of 2017 , more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hima still live from their home pre@@ fecture . &quot;
&quot; in disaster situations like most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation areas , most of the ev@@ ac@@ uation shel@@ ters are older than 50 years old . they do not have to compete with massive construction projects . this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games , which will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the World is small : our Pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when one encounters people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences appear to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important , as they challenge our prejudices , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at exactly these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat topics that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
&quot; we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members , who remember a moment in which they have felt very strongly connected to someone over language and country borders . &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the similarities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ aci@@ as talks about the time , how a hike has made their affection to the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time when it has worked with people from all over the world ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has collected in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva on a widespread photo .
&quot; at the age of 33 years , a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered in the intensive care station : last Friday he had taken a police officers during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with a stroke against the head . nationwide , millions of demonstr@@ ators participated in a protest against austerity . &quot;
Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on this Saturday and have now moved him in an artificial comm@@ a .
his condition is regarded as critical .
the local image colum@@ n@@ ist Lu@@ iz da Luz made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which quickly spread within a few days rapidly in Brazil .
&quot; the images also identified the face of the police officers , who attacked with a stroke . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident of the active service . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes at Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his impact on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Luz ) .
&quot; if a police officers would count on a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care station , his face would be six months on TV and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a press channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officers , and several san@@ itation shortly thereafter to him . &quot;
&quot; filmed a further video of the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , also appeared in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another federal state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2.@@ 700 Euros ) to stay part of the cost of medical treatment and to keep his family in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , while he is in hospital . &quot;

&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s experienced a wave of political force : here , the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was murdered by his father because he joined the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have attacked the most sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ re@@ ira since Silva , who has been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an , having been attacked by a poli@@ cem@@ an , who struck him with a stroke . &quot;
police attacks
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police forces on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; poli@@ c@@ emen set in protests in the center of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for Red@@ ner , rubber bul@@ lets and Tr@@ Ã¤n@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the MP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Social and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asking the police via loud@@ speakers , to refrain from violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers around the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian Media street prot@@ ested by placing the focus on another , unexpected prot@@ agon@@ ists : a shut@@ down . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo reported targeted about a bro@@ w glass window to make it illustr@@ ative with a photo of their front pages .
&quot; in contrast , the O Glob@@ o preferred a title story with a set of fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason , more about a broken window wheel than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defence of a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this must also be recognized , if strictly against any form of damage . &quot;
&quot; here also the term &quot; V@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dis@@ proportionate meaning , and the typical power of violence by the head@@ lines with the title &quot; demonstr@@ ators on confrontation with the police &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the forgotten villages of the de@@ induc@@ tive villages in Cuba
with the introduction of the Law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso we joined almost hundreds of sugar farms throughout Cuba the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the people of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , who is located in the Western Cub@@ an Province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - regardless of which there is no typical sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years ago when the activities were included in the sugar cane factories .
&quot; after the yield , the sugar cane industry remained silent in the region , and the factory lost gradually , after its lines , until only the rum@@ st made of steel and concrete remains . &quot;
about 2@@ 72 workers had to be re@@ inv@@ ent .
some are rarely the work .
&quot; other res@@ ig@@ ni@@ zed and com@@ mu@@ te daily to the factories , which are ex@@ hor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who runs every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ bed his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar@@ ro@@ foam factories in the east of the region , which have been in operation after a long in@@ active time because they were received . &quot;
it was something that he did not expect .
N@@ ene remembers that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ am I would receive the sugar cane factory but the promise has not been held .
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist the pl@@ agues , the case of socialism , the low market price , of in@@ efficiency , the bad administrative decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , the production was 1,6 million tons of sugar , less than the 1910 produced . &quot;
&quot; a few decades ago the message would have been a motive for alarm for the country , but the poor harv@@ ests are no new . &quot;
why was the Cub@@ an sugar industry turned off ?
the old railway escal@@ ator of the church already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated , and hardly competitive they were un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories that can produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
&quot; the motives , which resulted in such measures were the low productivity of the sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar @-@ price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 until 20@@ 25 the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 published report &quot; &quot; Agriculture &quot; &quot; of the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organization of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.@@ 6 million tonnes ) , the raw @-@ sugar @-@ export would manage approximately 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will come into history with certainty , that was the first words of the Cub@@ an President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from there , the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the lac@@ tation period of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sweet@@ ness factory Greg@@ orio Arl@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ am on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , is the word that he repeated most . &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
in order to obtain the place they formed a full @-@ time working group .
&quot; before the first turn of the year , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents containing just relating to the parts that would be removed , the address sat and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could have lost any acceptance . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was over and the letters were always more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was in charge of the still@@ s factory for two years and he was one who received letters . &quot; &quot; the country had no money for the still in operation . &quot; &quot; he received no money . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , waiting for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the stagnation of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the industrial area developed by Cuba and the most important job producers has been removed .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for working and services that the systems were generated in the communities in which they were present . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the present persons , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories have not been in operation for five years . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar tube is extracted only high by the elections .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the Municipality of Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar @-@ pipe factory closed , or better said than they began to dis@@ credit them , they also heard on the road to asp@@ hal@@ ting it , this also disadvantaged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with already advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to seek other factories . &quot;
you have been invited to spare parts .
&quot; without future perspectives , many young people also left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production is not even used for the supply of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new facility are still imposing .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene came back to the factory , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ un@@ und@@ forty were bringing the old soldiers a r@@ ents of two thousand Pes@@ o a month , to reti@@ re the years in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a subsequent person , nevertheless he gives the lies that you told him not . &quot;
you have joined him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is over 65 years in R@@ ent , not because it is lacking in power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

&quot; youth of the First Nations communities in all of Canada are dealing with topics that are important to them . they do they by hi@@ p Hop , thanks to a series of migration workshops . &quot;
&quot; as part of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , the workshop manager mobile Ton@@ studios have been directly involved in schools and youth centers in order to teach young groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live appearances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by the Ped@@ ago@@ gues David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and in North Que@@ bec , with ten Cre@@ e communities , and then together with the Cre@@ e Hi@@ p Hop group The North@@ stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop ends with that the young participants in discussions such as &quot; cultural identity , language , examination , love , self acceptance &quot; or whatever can arise in mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the main actors .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and invited to organise similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in the U.S. state Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; yo@@ o in the area of the tribe of the kitesur@@ fing First Nation in British Columbia , for example , called the history of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; in which nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were largely un@@ explained .
&quot; the next video of Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motive for a video player to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs , despite influences by globalisation . &quot;
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always master the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation has recorded , the chor@@ us will be sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
the young people involved got some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North@@ stars Hi@@ p Hop Group which gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e lying .
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the St@@ rop@@ he is available in trans@@ cript , as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in myself
but I try to go on earth on earth
this is the day when you get out of our cry
because we as youth have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise one day
I do not want to see how to live a bad life
this is how they can grow and go ahead as our youth
so they can do what they are determined by the creator .
&quot; in the commentary box , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ents of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the st@@ rop@@ ry in silent ins@@ cription ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
in Japan @-@ plastic meals are not only shown in the restaurant

in Japan one can see in front of almost any restaurant plastic courts .
&quot; to show potential customers , which is exactly on the menu , will be located near the entrance sho@@ ku@@ k@@ pur@@ u ( which will be issued by the &quot; &quot; Plas@@ tic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of each food , which is served in this restaurant . &quot;
&quot; the customers see these plastic courts , and then decide whether they enter the restaurant or go on . &quot;
there is a whole industry dedicated to making these plastic meals .
&quot; the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district is a large number of these small companies that manufacture those plastic courts , which the German film@@ makers W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a over 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese people , these plastic dishes usually are so common that they can not see them once again . however , a new trend is turning it into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gadgets . &quot;
&quot; with Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series published by social media links and photos that this unusual twist with the sho@@ ku@@ k@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now on special sale : new with plastic rib@@ bed mobile phones as shown in Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ yu Kauf@@ haus .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were turned to kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , refriger@@ ation magnets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ vel heating magnets for a new exhibit in the Tokyo station .
the new boom of the Essen@@ tions is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ isen @-@ don ( a popular travel bowl with seafood ) turned into a cell phone .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as mobile phones .
&quot; also , this part we have produced for the exhibition at the Tokyo station . &quot;
and here is an apple that keeps your cell po@@ orer :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that is only the beginning of an increasing attraction .
&quot; some mobile phones and mobile phone designers allow you to manufacture your own artwork . in this case i@@ kur@@ a or salmon , a favorite but@@ t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
on Twitter some users had their doubts :
&quot; can there be someone who would say : &quot; wow , cool , now I can put my cell phone with salmon @-@ o@@ estrogen ? &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appe@@ tizing form , to surprise for example colleagues or family members unpleasant . &quot;
our newest cell phones has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( on@@ ig@@ iri ) , ear@@ rings and wr@@ y@@ ills from dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other sk@@ ur@@ ri@@ le plastic meals can be viewed under : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow on Twitter using the h@@ ash@@ tag # , in the event of &quot;
&quot; if you would like to find out more about the origin of these trends , then this video gives an insight into the K@@ app@@ ab@@ ashi district , dedicated to the Bel@@ ie@@ fer@@ ment of the restaurant industry . as for example , with the sho@@ ku@@ k@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic meals are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers , &quot;

&quot; in reports in foreign and foreign media on the in@@ famous &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; in Mexico , the Ver@@ mis@@ hes and Get@@ ter regularly dive on statistics . however , these are not reflected in the extent of the human tragedy which will bring about this struggle . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a Kart@@ ell , urged the stories of the victims of the conflict completely into the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the dream or the churches which have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; standing behind every body , behind each bone report in the hundreds of heated tombs , the stories of loose parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never cure . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico launched the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; with drug trading living &quot; &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and stories of people who are involved in the battle between law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico describes the project like this :
organised crime does not just let us fear our lives .
the effects are far more profound .
&quot; for example , if businesses close , because they are threatened by drug traders and all the churches therefore have to drive many kilometers to do something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of victims
a video with the title &quot; Vi@@ a@@ que cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changed &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; one main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father , which is seeking every weekend married tombs after his son . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ guez , who lost only one day her father , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ew . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves again for the task which we have placed to go , go and to graves after the people we loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 as he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical business in El N@@ aran@@ jo .
on October 13th he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need a training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , which is here with me . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my Father , but they do not receive them out , because they demand a death penalty . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must not only show the faces of those who make themselves of fear . we need to show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some extracts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a writer of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; your contribution reminds us that you should never look at violence as normal , no matter what form it does occur : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensors for some years now .
I come by newspaper cli@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures that can actually only come from a textbook for crimin@@ ology or from specialists .
it brings me out of the version .
&quot; sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who disgu@@ sted or sad . it acts like a lack of respect towards the person , who once belonged to this body . &quot;
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
it continues :
&quot; no , it is not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old C@@ ousin thinks he wants Nar@@ co ( German : drug vendors ) if he is big . and it is also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the pen@@ er if they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they washed those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that they also have something like that . &quot;
I see our weakness if hist@@ ories will be mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
the in@@ som@@ nia of the people is incredible to me if the death of six people and the intensi@@ fication of 43 students in a neighboring village can be justified that they were &quot; purch@@ as@@ ant .
&quot; I think they try to speak out that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies when they are not stir@@ ring and silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four @-@ month Ex@@ pres@@ tion in the main city district : how a family has been lo@@ oted in the main city district . therein , it describes how to sup@@ press the armed crime month for month money by their business , until they ended up not only the store , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think everything you have lost and how many people can change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; pain above never dies , the trau@@ ma remains , the fear goes back high , if you are alone . &quot;
habits have changed , phone numbers also . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the further we are from each other , the better . &quot;
it included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , for they don &apos;t know when they will cause you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days if crying out my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answers is no , because I forgot how to cri@@ be . I have to learn to live with pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : one by force awarded generation . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the edge of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a guard and he tells him that he had to teach herself how to cook a egg , potatoes , tor@@ tillas and &quot; Chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies that live with him . this is his name for the preparation of bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
&quot; however , they are insignificant in comparison with the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for the whole life of violence and who had to learn to live . &quot;
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had van@@ ished . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood has been over two years before , when he was just a couple of blocks away from his home , the bloody mor@@ che of his father saw that was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born as Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence was mixed by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world because of the number of kill@@ ings according to the Council of public security and government of the United States Government . &quot;
in 2010 the Public Pro@@ secutor is 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to the average of 8.@@ 5 Mor@@ den per day .
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leaves organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
few stories live in view of getting new head@@ lines . this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ tico 2015 has launched the Dat@@ alog@@ ous project of Nar@@ co@@ data , whose aim is to present the complex information behind the fighting fight against drug trafficking , which has tor@@ tured the country in the last four decades , in an intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
&quot; sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; from Flickr users Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) warning : this post and the pages to which he linked , contain images on which violence is represented . &quot;
the fact check is important in a moment in which it is about to lift up a rum@@ or or for@@ gery .
&quot; but what is the year after something has faced the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( DRC ) .
&quot; since its first publication , it was mis@@ leading to prevent trage@@ dies which actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false copy of image and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in terminology of Global Vo@@ ices , or First D@@ raft News - does not deny the fact that there is abundant reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a petrol station wagon the place of San@@ ge in the east of the DR Congo , ki@@ cked off and explo@@ ded . thereby 230 people came to life . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected and thus devast@@ ated . the streets in the region have become dangerous paths , which were difficult to drive . &quot;
tra@@ gically fell victim to the tank @-@ carriage to the victim .
&quot; administration officials described a fire@@ ball , the d@@ utz@@ lig@@ ador@@ ned houses including a movie theaters in the vicinity , which was full of people , which illumin@@ ate the football world @-@ master@@ ed . &quot;
houses are disper@@ sed and shortened cor@@ p@@ ses were disper@@ sed in the streets .
many people were burned to the nonsense .
&quot; a picture with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; by the Im@@ g@@ ur user My@@ sti@@ cal Mon@@ key , 12 January 2015 Multi@@ shot photos of the incident , make the hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example for this .
it shows rows of stun@@ ned body that are kn@@ itted on the floor while people are looking at it .
but here the story does not find its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo has been re@@ written several times on social media , blogs and other platforms , but not to be attributed to the trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
on 3 January 2015 fighters of the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of B@@ aga and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on .
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dras@@ tically of atro@@ cities which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and cor@@ pse storms in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were mass@@ ac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the numbers could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; nobody was left to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a citizen to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many have been sm@@ ashed , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be displayed . &quot;
&quot; the occasion for the attack remained un@@ solved , but the army @-@ based position in B@@ aga was a permanent conflict between the military Nig@@ eri@@ as and the attempt at the B@@ oko Har@@ am , country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the image has emerged from the DR Congo , as proof of the fact and the potential extent of the attack was presented : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days to Paris . &quot;
you are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this mis@@ used use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of failure ; Africa Check has documented orders to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
in all these cases the image was presented as proof of mass@@ acres .
yet another step continues to bring personal comments such as the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in relation to arguments .
the image from San@@ ge also appeared in conjunction with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning written , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee beats , rape and a number of dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported from violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following that they brought together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an acid @-@ Arab news page , which in 2012 confirmed that the President of the mar@@ s Th@@ an being said , monks and politicians had participated in the assassination of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image of the DR Congo to record this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was accessed last on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations , who called AF@@ P as their source , had likewise mis@@ diagnosed this testimony , but had not brought the picture from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dis@@ closures have come back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from anywhere around the world .
&quot; using a &quot; &quot; opposite picture search &quot; &quot; you can see how far more information can be crossed . &quot;
&quot; an up@@ lifted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has at 18.@@ 8 billion images ( status of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 images found , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mix@@ er private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are in many different languages like English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
some have conve@@ yed false reports ; others have tried to expose the counterf@@ eit@@ s .
&quot; we have taken examples of the mis@@ used use and brought them into contact with the respective countries , based on which page they had been published . by this , we want to be more clearly visible than by the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which were also connected in some cases ) can be used several examples of mis@@ used use .
here are some cases which can now be completely demol@@ ished ( on the map in Orange ) :
map : news frames .
state @-@ examples of false cou@@ pl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange colored countries indicate the examples of counterf@@ eit@@ ing or fal@@ low messages are still available .
&quot; the countries in Gray are examples , the according to the met@@ adata and information that are available via Tin@@ Eye , probably also for@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo has been posted in an online discussion forum ( directed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a threads to the &quot; war of Buddh@@ ists against Muslims . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; the Myanmar government released a ri@@ oting position on what they came as &quot; inten@@ tional &quot; news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ concep@@ tions regarding Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this ri@@ oting , which appeared exclusively in English , also contains references to counterf@@ eit images of rum@@ ors , that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech operate and used by extrem@@ ist groups to realize that Muslims are killing Buddh@@ ists and other coun@@ ties ( which is often transmitted by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;

&quot; this post , which directed to the members of the Rus@@ so @-@ Orthodox Church , is clear that the image of the DR Congo is NOT showing the Muslim Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news , however , claimed that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein Sein was given in 2012 that monks and politicians had been involved in the killing of the Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought together the story with the image from San@@ ge . &quot;
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of this publication the picture continues to be included . &quot;
Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article of 2014 on students published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the B@@ oko Har@@ am , has explicitly stated that the picture did not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it was a &quot; similar d@@ schi@@ a &quot; attack . &quot;

&quot; they wanted to achieve that their communities found these events , the mut@@ in@@ ous in the name of Islam , a greater attention . &quot;
United States of 2015 .
&quot; the picture was we@@ ather@@ ed as evidence of the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 ( and more than 9.@@ 300 times saved ) . but the messages that were associated with it , were adopted in no religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to attract attention to the relative number of the dead and a comparison of media reporting , compared to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
Vietnam ( Portuguese ) .
&quot; after a message that supposedly was dra@@ fted by a &quot; &quot; P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ erian mass@@ acres , put it in circulation like this in the Vietnamese and declared it for counterf@@ eit news . &quot;
&quot; from the message in which the image from the DR Congo has been , the organization of the Clar@@ ity mission@@ aries and P@@ ater Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; there are other examples of a faul@@ ty use of the picture from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;

frames and pictures
&quot; there are two strong topics or frames ( fr@@ ing@@ es ) , which will undergo this post@@ ings . the first frame focuses on religion . &quot;
the photo was used in relation to larger discussion about the silence in relation to the wor@@ m@@ ations of Christians through Muslims or - to the defence of Muslims - the prevalence of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Buddh@@ ists .
a second fr@@ aming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated compared to a European or French life .
religion is to understand and the value of human life is both important . therefore it is worth to examine how images are used in connection with these efforts .
&quot; a deeper question is , however , what happens when readers can no longer believe this pictures . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who share un@@ intended to practice the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; sug@@ ary this mood of mis@@ - and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ins@@ ists it the real Gre@@ ys of what actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of extensive images has already been deb@@ ated in detail ( for example ) .
&quot; an argument is that the res@@ tra@@ int of images of a ref@@ usal comes like to acknowledge the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern that violent images readers and spectators are des@@ ensi@@ tizing and give them the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , the analysed , how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to be discussed with regard to violent representations in the news media , it is that they are indispensable for the current news report . &quot;
&quot; Techn@@ ologist experim@@ ented with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; F@@ ake News &quot; . they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something that actually , however , can also be replaced by the context or on completely mis@@ used manner . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false grants should also be taken into account as internationally . &quot;

the &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqueness of smaller languages
phot@@ o- of Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog with the name Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( eg . un@@ practic@@ able ) strives to offer language inspired by a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words exist in any language : they express certain situations or feelings which are often very complex or specific .
some of these un@@ predictable words are already well known ( like the famous Portuguese su@@ da@@ de ) and others who are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ k@@ esa ) .
but all resist@@ ances stand stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt to a simple translation .
&quot; a word or phrase is not enough , why a full explanation and sometimes some context are required to accurately understand what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , Portuguese or Finnish words , while author and lingu@@ ist from &quot; Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find for example words from the M@@ w@@ ot@@ sy language of Van@@ u@@ at@@ u , like : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Bem@@ mel for your parents in recognition of how to have tried you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ creen language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The convenience or la@@ z@@ iness that you feel after having been stir@@ red up on cold days in the sun .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog about :
they neg@@ ate other cultures to un@@ cover other thought and wake up our curiosity .
&quot; sometimes you can influence how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this side , want to publish more of these &quot; &quot; insur@@ able &quot; words and show them how different , valuable and impressive these small languages . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages &quot; , &quot; which are highly appreciated by Un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite clothes here . &quot;

like Sri Lanka with the worst fle@@ t@@ disaster of the decade
the island of Sri Lanka is currently looking forward to the worst flood and cat@@ astrop@@ hic disaster in this decade .
&quot; triggered by mon@@ soon , which usually advocates the end of May , are due to strong rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country over the banks . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ ere centre of Sri Lanka on 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundred people are missing because of the floods and loops . &quot;
over 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100 000 people have been transported to 30@@ 4 safe locations .
&quot; the rains left on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water@@ beds in some areas went slowly . &quot;
health and hygiene changes are a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the scale disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with waterfalls of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am Ame@@ or and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
Sri Lanka deadly flu@@ ently wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue crisis . save the Children &apos;s Children after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way .
&quot; today , the Nel@@ u@@ wa Bus stood in the high water , water level up to 6 meters . village Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the thunder@@ ings of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force has provided five aircraft for b@@ ail@@ out campaigns , and other five are made for transportation of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organizations and star@@ tu@@ ps have also been explained to help .
Facebook @-@ Pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tory in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Rel@@ ief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information about flood situation and humanitarian aid .

&quot; the Tax@@ ir@@ u@@ f @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks for people to share their location data with the help of the app , so that the Cat@@ ast@@ oph@@ thal@@ mic Centre will be informed . &quot;
&quot; last year after the disaster of the Tro@@ pen@@ chant Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me led a &quot; &quot; high @-@ water aid &quot; button , which allowed it to access a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then passed on to the Sri Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; likewise , they carried out a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which had more than thousand requests and 150 successful boat trip actions for floo@@ ding and lands@@ li@@ ger@@ ent people . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts by the government and the civilian population of Sri Lan@@ kan , where multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , inhabitants in need in need of security and provide support . &quot;
this has prevented the loss of other human life ; the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restoring norm@@ ality .
Muslims who cannot see
the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo of the Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ ha@@ zi .
utilizing Per@@ ig@@ t.@@ Dam@@ as in January I took part at the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
&quot; I trust her four year old daughter , she trusted me her children ; she is my rock in the br@@ anding . &quot;
at one minute we will call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights .
in the next we call rights for trans@@ gender .
&quot; we are located in a sea of Um@@ br@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic image of a woman with a head @-@ cloth , bound by an American flag , other sk@@ ating slo@@ gans against Islam@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says : &quot; &quot; these things do not concern yourself , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not an atmosphere ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims , &quot; which has built themselves in their imagination . &quot;
they discour@@ aged me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we can identify Muslim to be a Muslim , in different kinds . but somehow we shall all be put into the same Muslim dra@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; this dra@@ wer is in our collective imagination , so well designed that once Muslims , who , as I do not fit , discour@@ aged there . &quot;
Muslim is to be discour@@ aged
I am not alone with it alone .
&quot; this is even happening to the poet , whose poetry in America is most sold : Rum@@ i . &quot;
which pictures come to mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
when J@@ al@@ alu@@ dd@@ in Rum@@ i was as old as I am now he was a Orthodox Muslim and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western idea , religion was deleted , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; this del@@ e@@ tion makes a large part of the history of 1.7 billion Muslims in this world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
another consists of the reduction pictures of Muslims that have known Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man that you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the groundbreaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid was breaking down the history behind these pictures in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ rude today .
&quot; our politicians , the news and Hollywood , they continue to stand . &quot;
I worked thirteen years in the news industry and I have seen how this powerful , faul@@ ty scar@@ f dominate our News@@ fe@@ eds . &quot;
&quot; this s@@ cr@@ acy over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed the reality that in the last three decades of nine Muslim women have led their countries , while the US could not even choose their first female candidate . &quot;
&quot; this s@@ cr@@ acy fails to acknowledge that if French , Muslim women are prevented from taking their head into public buildings and to cover acid @-@ Arab , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body , which these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group exercise his &quot; control &quot; on the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ cr@@ v weak@@ ens Muslim women to guide movements for change .
it looks over that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans who were meanwhile brought up with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of Que@@ er Muslims .
this s@@ cr@@ acy has occupied our collective imagination such deep and flawless that often Si@@ kh men and children become the goal of anti @-@ militar@@ ist attacks and ra@@ ils .
&quot; on account of these stories , which we tell and due to the nature in which we tell them , is Islam@@ ophobia today not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to include 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just tell stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we are also creating Nar@@ r@@ atives to help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to grasp the s@@ cr@@ v of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed here where seven million Muslims face the highest degree of &quot; various &quot; religious group in America .
more than one third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ African Americans .
&quot; six out of ten American Muslims belong to the immigrants of the first generation , which come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the authors in 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my parents came to live in New York for their American dream .
&quot; my mother put her first jewelry design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the skyscrapers of New York ; skyscrapers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan had newly discovered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were unavoidable Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I not f@@ aint and Americ@@ an@@ erin ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t give por@@ k , I say - instead of my Muslim recipes , or my hand@@ some pocket records , whom all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; from respect to Pep@@ pa W@@ utz &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I jo@@ kes , we do not carry all the flas@@ hes with us . &quot;
we also have to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to almost always be selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight far widespread lies over Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced at the current volume of a well @-@ supported Islam@@ ist environment with money , thinking tanks and experts for fal@@ con@@ information that is ours already faul@@ ty image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ ist forces exists in more than just a stranger who cap@@ ri@@ ps a woman into the head . &quot;
&quot; or as the start@@ ling map of attacks on mos@@ ques in the whole USA , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ ist campaigns in its ugly forms acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity that is so far , so versatile and multi @-@ lay@@ ered that it can be impossible to fit into a dra@@ wer . &quot;
in 1986 the author in 1986 was on a picture of their nursery .
use approved .
I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as Mus@@ atmosphere , but a mus@@ es was born only then into my imagination , when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientist describe religious life , they attack the following terms : faith , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief and behavior are perhaps not always visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , my neighbor in the Brand@@ ing see that I am a climate when they could look through the 15 feet of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
she would see the evening ritual with my daughter when I am talking about them in my arms and her the Arab verses to protect the oppressed ones called the Koran and the Q@@ ul@@ s .
each of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask for that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one could not see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim belief is probably not always visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an I@@ k@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , with her sisters sometime in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
belonging is the image of my grandmother maternal part with her sisters ; how long ago she won a contest of the art of flower arran@@ ging in Kar@@ achi two decades ago .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I will see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by their finished and un@@ finished painting painted Su@@ fi sanc@@ ti@@ es. and a cor@@ k with many book@@ marks , a book with a hundred and fourteen chapters that can be almost mem@@ orized . &quot;
&quot; it means to be a mushroom , to speak the prayers they said to me when I have a bad day . &quot;
&quot; it is what they have taught me to relate to God , Allah Mi@@ an what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people that was founded through centuries - through an &quot; &quot; Empire &quot; , &quot; which has established a company with the name Ehr@@ worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;
the author in 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means to grow and hear that men do not cry , but at the same time see that my zu@@ ander@@ thal grandfather are crying . &quot;
&quot; while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of Kas@@ h@@ mir@@ s , crying N@@ ana J@@ aan excluded to his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family that he did not include in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging to know is that there are millions of Kurds and Palestinians , whose families , like in my grandfather , were torn apart from colon@@ ists , who have shared the Muslim world as at the play risk . &quot;
&quot; having to be an atmosphere means to know that over the past two centuries Europeans all have &quot; &quot; coloni@@ alized &quot; &quot; to four Muslim countries . &quot;
knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history dates back to a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indones@@ ian sub@@ tan of the British empire , was designated by the newspapers of his time as &quot; dangerous &quot; , &quot; because he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; even before they were air@@ planes he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was , preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;
the Word of Islam .

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion are goes deep into our unforgettable pedi@@ gre@@ es back ; our un@@ plug@@ ging history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops being distributed across every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , has gone to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that over half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried beneath the ruins of the war .
an American Mus@@ h@@ ore means to know that the self @-@ ord@@ rate among veter@@ ans have risen by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that if a tragedy is da@@ wning the US and the susp@@ ects has a Muslim name , the story will report four times more than a story with a white attack . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that before fourteen hundred years of the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a friendly black slaves called Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islam@@ ist , called Bil@@ ali Muhammad , ens@@ lav@@ ed and brought into that country . &quot;
it means Mal@@ col@@ m X has an American hero .
&quot; it is the warmth that I sen@@ sed , when people crowded the airports in order to fight the Muslim Ban . &quot;
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black lives .
&quot; being a Americ@@ an@@ erin , a Pak@@ ist@@ ad@@ i , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Mus@@ cle and a journalist , means the in@@ dur@@ al inter@@ sec@@ tional part of our with multiple rods , but to fail them to communicate with others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ rati@@ fication of 1.7 billion has more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reduced doubt &quot; against it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; being a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , well @-@ knowing that powerful and privileged people on this branch are structural Islam@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; structural Islam@@ ist forces consists of the Muslim registr@@ ations , started with President Bush and extended to President Obama . &quot;
it consists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists in the immigration officer , who takes five years old child in a manual . &quot;
it consists in a country that closes its borders with people from just across the countries that bom@@ bed it .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly @-@ list &quot; which is largely Arabs and Muslims to Vis@@ it .
they are the wars that we lead and the bombs which we have Muslim countries .
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study with the title A@@ scent of Man , scientists from North@@ western University participants showed a scientific un@@ real picture and pointed them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the Con@@ vers@@ ations we have to guide
&quot; we are too deeply dar@@ ing to dis@@ sect the Muslim or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we stand for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the faul@@ ty and dangerous ima@@ gery , which we put in our news alert . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims within the media industry , which tries to capture our frequently mis@@ placed identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast See something , S@@ ay something from Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the Pod@@ cast # Good@@ Mus@@ lim@@ Bad@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ ale Vide@@ os@@ ery Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; S@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative , growing Muslim authors to print and Ms Mar@@ vel , the Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ese , Muslim , American Super@@ hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
&quot; but I am worried because of this difficult global time , in which we are . &quot;
and this moment has consequences that go beyond 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is one reason for that conspir@@ ist the@@ or@@ ist , which existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now the White House . &quot;
&quot; they have grown expon@@ entially , because they have made Muslims on &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there is another group that has grown expon@@ entially , by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , it had not yet given them ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am worried about the realities and the history , which I was not aware of when I was old , as it is now my daughter , but which today made me a inevitable muscle . &quot;
things that I left here like a Br@@ ot@@ kr@@ umen@@ ical track in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps aw@@ aken memories , because in all the inter@@ sections that our mankind constitutes , a story may lau@@ ern , where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , the conversation in Berkeley can be held in the context of the 8th annual conference to Islam@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militarism &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are no terms with which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ side of the Islamic Studies Network .
we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people re@@ acted by the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public presentation , four decades himself of scientist Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves un@@ convenient questions after the role of it , consciously and consciously to solidi@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; because the employment that we have not met a new future in which we have no president who bombar@@ ded already cap@@ ut@@ te countries and &quot; to other made &quot; people &quot; goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for Nar@@ r@@ art seeks to preserve urban diversity
&quot; stor@@ yt@@ ellers , from Flickr users Daniele Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be an opportunity to connect to someone here and now in spite of a language barriers ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the list of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative of Steven Bird , the Un@@ en@@ force@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to maintain and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or Oak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has been conducted since 2015 events , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children there . &quot;
for the creators of the project apply :
&quot; the slaughter of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities , the diversity - safe spaces where citizens must not forget who they are to belong . &quot;
&quot; while &quot; listen often to it to understand , &quot; &quot; see these events instead &quot; &quot; listening to you to feel &quot; &quot; to feel &quot; . &quot; &quot;
in this format you will tell your story first in their own language and then translate them to English .
&quot; even though the participants are not professional table @-@ stor@@ yt@@ eller , their devotion and their representation makes sure that the audience &apos;s audience is ins@@ isted . &quot;
they call laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story of Burkina Faso , which is told in the language D@@ af@@ ing . during this round the story t@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou was also an opportunity to explain the stories of narrative art for their land . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara tells the f@@ ences of the hare and the Pavi@@ an in the language Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after he declared the importance of his Fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ us@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is it to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile he shares his sense of inclu@@ siveness : &quot;
you have listened to !
you were attentive ...
you were all with me !
&quot; up to now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling in three cities took place and the organis@@ ers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project , can contact T@@ LS to get their own stor@@ yt@@ ellers . &quot;

&quot; thus , the so @-@ called &quot; Center for New Economy , &quot; is a non @-@ governmental non @-@ profit organization without Party membership , with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law for government responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian Web@@ ler Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bas@@ sel Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives were continuing the campaign for his freedom and remind of the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; this year &apos;s annual report : public@@ a , the annual conference on digital culture , which is hosted in Berlin , is devoted to an event of the # Free@@ Bas@@ sel campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie D@@ ul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , manager of the book of Freedom : A Collec@@ tive In@@ des ( The cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ) . &quot;
the book that was published last year and is available here licence @-@ free contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the coun@@ tenance of oppression .
it is a homage to Bas@@ sel and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book wishes to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge , and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge , have been working side to the fog that surrounds our news@@ fe@@ eds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bas@@ sel Kh@@ art@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers , who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was rep@@ ain@@ ted from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on 3 October 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or place of residence . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and family , who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bas@@ sel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , has many of us start to think about their own dest@@ in@@ ates , deeds and decisions . &quot;
why are we now here ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of time @-@ wise convic@@ tions ?
the web@@ Develop@@ er for Open Source and digital activ@@ ist has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 Bas@@ sel was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer of N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi , reported that the &quot; military police Bas@@ sel reported on the basis of a &quot; &quot; secret &quot; &quot; command of the military base from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015 , advoc@@ ated themselves as in@@ sider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bas@@ sel played a crucial role to expand access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , Techn@@ ologist and at the moment over@@ riding the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bas@@ sel , writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; perhaps none of Bas@@ sels cultural prototypes was fores@@ ee@@ able than the work , which he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important arche@@ ological sites of the world , was the cross @-@ crossing of many civilizations and here merge Greek @-@ Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bas@@ sel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything about it , this architecture that not only em@@ bodies the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
&quot; this strike into the digital arche@@ ology and conservation has created a time clause , which will be invaluable to the public and for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
iron@@ ically this project has not yet been completed so far .
&quot; N@@ oura G@@ ha@@ zi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband , to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my whole life with this , dream of freedom to dream , and Bas@@ sel taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhelmed when I call his name .
Bas@@ sel gave me English at even when he was already in custody .
I learned to read and speak English well .
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked . he taught other de@@ tain@@ ees to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bas@@ sel has opened me the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computer and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners of how they use computers , at least theoretically , without fact that they actually had one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ ha@@ zi is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , an instant smell , which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015 , when he was in custody . &quot;
Bas@@ sel and N@@ oura worked together in the book for a year .
&quot; she gri@@ pped the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he transferred them from the Arabic to English . &quot;
the book is license @-@ free .
book of Youssef Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to public domain .
here an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a with the title &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens when you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I miss in the world of your enchanting sight , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
that any of the dangers certainly doesn &apos;t care
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ackl@@ es and gu@@ ardi@@ ans &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I went in every detail of your voice and words .
I am carrying passion with me
if your eyes may say well
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
to pick up all the moments
and for your absence to we@@ ep and smile .
I remember myself that I will return soon ...
on the first anniversary of the imprisonment of Bas@@ sel wrote G@@ ha@@ zi :
&quot; a year passed , my soul &quot;
during the period
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ sels history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of the protests in 2011 against the regime of Bashar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 6@@ 5,000 people have disappeared from the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian network ) . &quot;
those who were arrested or were accused of violence by the regime were tor@@ tured or even executed .
&quot; since 2011 , Am@@ nesty International has died at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bas@@ sel for 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call in the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Moz@@ ambi@@ que : because of corruption in@@ separ@@ ated director after prison @-@ release res@@ c@@ ission again on previous post
&quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ ans re@@ acted with anger on a corrupt situation , in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus , where the corruption has been committed . &quot;
&quot; this is the Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in 2010 with four other def@@ endants ( about 800 000 Euro ) to 22 years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of the Moz@@ ambi@@ que airport , whose Council of Cam@@ ba@@ za set between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately called for its re@@ inst@@ at@@ ement in the company , which happened on 19 April as well . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with an opinion of the General State @-@ General Pro@@ secutor of the Republic , which claims the application , there would be no obstacle for Cam@@ ba@@ za to re @-@ assert his old post , since the company was not completing a discipl@@ in@@ arity after his custody . &quot;
&quot; however , many citizens called the action not well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public integrity ( Centro de Integr@@ ated de P@@ Ãº@@ blica , briefly C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , was condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to re@@ configure the director : &quot;
&quot; represents a back @-@ back in the fight against corruption and clari@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a reg@@ ress with regard to the efforts of our legal system , the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we take note is that the company should have a discipl@@ in@@ arity against the with@@ held obj@@ ections .
&quot; however , the company apparently slo@@ g up and does not set any reasonable legal steps to apply the respective functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ an social media , re@@ jects this behavior also and considers the case as &quot; black@@ ness &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and to eat half of them . &quot;
&quot; he could hold talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could consult and pol@@ ishing his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to cause harm . &quot;
thus it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is going to be paid for his silence .
contradic@@ tory !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ an and student of political sciences in Brazil , the director had no morality : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state , because he was in@@ vigor@@ ated I can not believe that someone was rewarded by the state that the state has already been so massive . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks the morality to return and serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served themselves on the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as a hand@@ ler to an in@@ exhaus@@ tible money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who re@@ charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ te preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Moz@@ ambi@@ que , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el to remember that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; th@@ iev@@ es belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , the Moz@@ ambi@@ ans will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp one @-@ cutting , and - next door with said - prophe@@ tic speakers . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous verbal depic@@ tions was , when he was vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; a ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for his ambitions , his own individual interest to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ah said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know if a ambitious man changes , my experience shows that this is not so . he changes the tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambitions . &quot;
a ambitious man is de@@ crimin@@ ally at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison ; he sat 10 years and came free .
&quot; and today , the company , in which he comp@@ ute funds , again under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - Ñ@@ Î±@@ No Ev@@ ros ( @ az@@ mal _ Raf@@ ik ) 12th May 2017 &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users to injustice
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; means Ki@@ cher@@ her@@ se or Sp@@ age .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Commons , Creative Commons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network received its post@@ ings from the net because they included the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people with East @-@ Indian origin , or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; in@@ ous . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; doing this &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
in recent years the rise of radical nation@@ alistic movements the Word has given an extremely radical con@@ notation .
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is commonly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on his platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;s may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself is not automatically called hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also Po@@ sts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts , for his use . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , there are several bur@@ mes@@ sic words with the different meanings that have the same letter as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ isch also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as also other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &apos; ( Sp@@ age p@@ sis ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar o@@ at &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ ook@@ y A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different meanings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail of one of my friends was er@@ ased today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in spiritual manner , whether she knew how he could allevi@@ ate his back pain by playing a word game . &quot;
&quot; the set ku la - &quot; &quot; cure &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the Fra@@ ck word ( la ) at Bur@@ m@@ isch - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that the hate speech will dimin@@ ish more radical nation@@ alists , stres@@ sing that Facebook must be analytical before it all post@@ ings to spread the suspi@@ cion that racism has been suspi@@ cion . &quot;
Facebook del@@ etes the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; not manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm is not understood what you write to Fac@@ be@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and control it by checking the following words .
&quot; for example , Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar PA@@ E &quot; ( Sp@@ age @-@ age ) . &quot;
&quot; the good is that these three @-@ earth nation@@ alists will spread the hate speech , a fairly good lesson . &quot;
&quot; now , it is time to be circumc@@ ised by its nationalism . &quot;
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who may distribute hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long . &quot;
&quot; the experience of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords are often a cat@@ chy and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are just starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the Word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his post@@ ings , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished off the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is closed . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post @-@ mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited to delete posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards did not talk &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has a variety of posts that have no negative purposes or simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech more radical nation@@ alists .
Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
post without hate speech from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Chan My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet Community to ask for advice : &quot;
Facebook may have a well @-@ performing intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform but it does not work .
to cens@@ or such words will only bring more hatred inside the various communities .
it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like &quot; chair &quot; or &quot; inheritance curr@@ y &quot; have forbidden .
&quot; even when they have found that they have made mistakes , they did not attempt to report the fal@@ si@@ ly dissolved posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that were compl@@ aining for them , would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebooks provide automatic cens@@ orship for a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make funny and write aware of the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech , in order to see if their post@@ ings are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots from Facebook @-@ Po@@ sts , which included no hate speech , but still removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and see pe@@ sen@@ curr@@ y and watch a Indian film .

scre@@ enshot used with permission .
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nationalist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists are used to have used social networks in order to increase their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks aims to heat violence in the communities in Myanmar , in particular in the territory of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where disputes between Muslims and Buddh@@ ists have forced thousands to escape . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to critic@@ ise the endurance @-@ hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages under control .
&quot; but instead of simply being cens@@ ored the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better running more on context than on code concentrated and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is at the end with the child &apos;s notice
a wedding ring in the sand .

the children of children is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on June 9 , 2017 , the parliament of the country unanimously decided to ban this practice , which this practice should for@@ bid . now it is 18 . &quot;
&quot; in particular , this change of marriage held some members of du@@ alistic and mus@@ li@@ ous religious communities in practice , and in May 2016 there came to a great public cry ( IR@@ O ) , a group , representatives of the various religious groups of the country , that the state does not interfere with as that , age did not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; this happened regardless of the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a solic@@ itation of the UN Human Rights Convention , the Min@@ ors as , every person under the age of 18 . &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were already married to 15 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and with 18 it were 8.@@ 1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal State of the country confirmed that from 1997 @-@ 2007 more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1300 boys were married under 19 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which tried to set laws for children before , followed the foot and pleasing of great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring this outcome . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Hin@@ du leader Z. B. had no concerns about the critics of the children before they should say , they are do@@ omed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition sort of tension in this actually in@@ complicated thing , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would not agree to the law . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of 2017 , the law was decided against the children &apos;s before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which included himself , so that he would be deb@@ ated in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and pro@@ claim the law .
&quot; one of the Sen@@ ators of the country gave us an update to Facebook , which has posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agram once again : &quot;
&quot; Mr Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children &apos;s before was agreed in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for this , and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; after he had decided previously in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of the social media users had been enth@@ r@@ alled because the laws were finally changed to the children before .
Facebook @-@ member Lo@@ vell Francis , who ar@@ ra@@ yed a ministry in the Ministry of Education : &quot;
&quot; it has taken too much time and unnecessary talk that has wasted the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the children &apos;s before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that is almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while A@@ bel Jackson &apos;s opinion was , it was definitely long enough to lay down the practice , Lara Qu@@ entr@@ e @-@ Thomas was happy that the day was finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status @-@ Update on Facebook by Lara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , , Excellent News ! &quot;
the marriage law has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , voices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ low Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( W@@ I@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that said quite openly about how important the adoption of the law was noted , &quot;
the pan@@ try age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent from the religious state of 18 .
&quot; the draft for the change of marriage was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
in the House of Represent@@ atives there are 41 members and of which 35 were present at the voting .
&quot; members , who were against , have voted for the law . &quot;
the children &apos;s before is in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ care .
many thanks to all activists who challenged him .
congratulations .
a thanks to our MEPs .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du @-@ organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago Mahar@@ aj has proclaimed his intention to undertake judicial steps , the law should be passed and he seems to be em@@ ulate his promises . &quot;
&quot; during the general pro@@ secutor Paris Al @-@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , meant it is quite lawful , if Mahar@@ aj wants to proceed against the law , the majority of social media users would like to address the debate differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rell proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , instead of holding the discussion so generally speaking , in a way we would , instead of talking about the problem , that the state , our daughters are protecting them that they are compared to the advantage , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether there is no legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where children &apos;s before in different gra@@ dations are legal or still the norm continues , although there are laws that they say . &quot;
h@@ ackers broke the office of the pro@@ secutor in the country @-@ wide protests on the Russian National Day

&quot; on the eve of national demonstrations against corruption , coinci@@ ded with the Day of Russia - the Russian National Day , the website of the Pro@@ secutor of Yar@@ os@@ lav@@ l was ch@@ opped off . h@@ ackers have left a wit@@ ty message . &quot;

&quot; around 11.@@ 15 the news from the site was removed , however , it remained intact . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the office of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s office divided the local news service of Yar@@ news that they were h@@ acked . &quot;
&quot; by mir@@ rors of websites , Turkish users can again look at Wikipedia content &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia @-@ page was reported on 18 January 2012 , contradic@@ tory to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the US , internationally dark@@ ened . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
for over a month Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pe@@ dia Wikipedia .
&quot; day by day becomes more evident , as important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV @-@ series are fighting against the blocking .
&quot; although many techn@@ ologic Internet users are used to use revers@@ ing tools for block web pages ( an current article of the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ val@@ ence of the world ) , most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been posted article by Wikipedia , as recently published in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , has been taking place regular block@@ ages of the Internet since 2007 , after the Internet Act ( No. 5@@ 6@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; in China , Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain closed , there are now several mir@@ ror@@ sites ( pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary file system ) , used as the platform for all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its de@@ centr@@ alised Peer @-@ to @-@ pe@@ er network ( computer calcul@@ ator ) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete zen@@ cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
the content is available in spite of legal b@@ anning .
in a blo@@ g@@ post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after we have heard the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put everything from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility of reading the content on de@@ centralized and distributed mode . &quot;

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was with the photos he saw around him never cont@@ ented . they were bl@@ ur@@ ry with poorly position@@ ists and washed colors .
the motivated him self is a camera to carry and try to understand the situation .
at that time he was still a kid .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar is endeav@@ ored to bring Nepal to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his homeland right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nep@@ als . &quot;
he described on Facebook like this first @-@ class situation in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could there be better for a passionate game of wildlife ! &quot;
&quot; I just rested from home when suddenly called Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) . he had received a call from my father , that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river would be a leop@@ ard . &quot;
the river dam@@ m is just a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him , and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the leop@@ ard was located and I immediately began to kne@@ eling pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar plans to co @-@ operation with the authorities to gain global recognition for Nepal &apos;s nature and would like to deepen understanding that wild animals are not so scary as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood tigers already from face to face : &quot;
a tiger cannot be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep not during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness on the way home , when suddenly the king of the Bu@@ il@@ k appeared . he immediately sets up , we see ourselves and he gaz@@ ing me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar is placed the logo &quot; I click for Conservation &quot; ( lit . : I clicked for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ hi@@ ves and wild animals is not always easy .
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent in order to take pictures from Ot@@ tern . up to 12 days it lasted until he was able to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds , which live near the tourist accommodation . &quot;

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az des an@@ wal@@ a and originally published on video Volun@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published again as part of a content sharing convention .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the greatest care to speak the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead they use a pron@@ oun or tell &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h give women to respect that they should respect the husband due to social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences they should equi@@ p this practice in life . &quot;
&quot; last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was condemned by the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a by a sho@@ ve , and rejected by her family and the village community after she had taken a da@@ unting relationship with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not mention in the name , is also prevalent among men . however , they have far less adequate instructions to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the district of P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health professionals , as well as house@@ wives , a unique club and thus became fast to the main table theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them only to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs , which exists in 13 Indian states , it is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al that is operated by the community Video Volun@@ te@@ ers , and committed to the reduction of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices , such as children &apos;s marriage , up to the exile of H@@ IV@@ - and AIDS infected persons , and guides these clubs . &quot;
they reported how these clubs made a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them amb@@ ass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video , the Roh@@ ini was shown in its discussion , acted by women who did not name their male sp@@ ouses . &quot;
she chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem that the women could easily identify .
&quot; to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands , is a bread which she is maintained and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini writes :
this tradition testi@@ fied that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
&quot; a woman who does not conce@@ al this , is seen as a back@@ rest , as a woman without morality . &quot;
the tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought to that discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name for her husband , to try out at home as it runs . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini talks :
&quot; my mother @-@ in @-@ in @-@ law and my husband stayed for a long time , after the video was finished . &quot;
&quot; Practi@@ se , my husband , turned to me and said , I should name him from now on in his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in his luggage the Roh@@ ini started its first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; Patri@@ arch@@ ate &quot; before . some felt it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ tt@@ ar Pra@@ des@@ h .
after the video projection the women tried to put the discussion with a exercise .
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , upset , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then asked them all , &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want it , does that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their hus@@ bands over the lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra over the Bre@@ chen of a centuries @-@ old tradition , in which married women could never say the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini talks :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she had hired only before the whole exercise , and another decided to let him out all the v@@ au@@ te frustration against him and his family by cur@@ sed him . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; in addition to the ad@@ renalin rush over , having broken with an old bread , the women decided that they were actually trying to call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
in the next few days Roh@@ ini received a variety of reports .
&quot; the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas they put into the head : his wife could not cease to say its name . &quot;
another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law she gaz@@ ing , she was afraid and said that there was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; Roh@@ ini said it . &quot;
a husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation rests in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the galvan@@ ic red spot on the forehead , showing the E@@ h@@ est@@ atus : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would carry the cin@@ o@@ red spot if he too . &quot;
he only lau@@ ghed only and I listened to him to wear him .
&quot; the other women have not fully ceased , but mine , they are now in a better position to choose themselves , to do it in some days . &quot;
for many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are doing a trip at every panel . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want the women to worry who what could hear , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things , such as our identi@@ ties on our hus@@ bands , have never been so honest . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to say certain things loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
in a panel we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing .
some women in the group have only worn s@@ coff@@ in since their marriage .
&quot; for most is the okay , but some wanted a sal@@ em spa , a broad shirt over a p@@ ants , wear ; they did not do it . &quot;
&quot; after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes @-@ choice , mor@@ als joined with the Sar@@ is and much more , ornam@@ ents Roh@@ ini her own pair of Kur@@ d ( Ober@@ inhi@@ den ) into a panel discussion , so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans , and Roh@@ ini is sure they will be able to do it . &quot;
&quot; the question whether things have changed in the five months since their first discussion club , Roh@@ ini , that things slowly enter into the roles : &quot;
we have only made small steps so far .
some women tried it a few times but then they listened again to say the name of their hus@@ anne .
&quot; some , included me , do it still , but only if they are alone and are not other family members . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women are now wearing Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their forehead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the cra@@ w@@ ling for more freedom of movement or the own clothes @-@ choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each one of us is a sacrifice of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am there too .
but this club gives each of us confidence that something will change .
and I know that it &apos;s not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and other people told what we talk about and what we do .
we all sit in the same boat .

G@@ ossi@@ ans men are de@@ ported in Moz@@ ambi@@ que and killed in Moz@@ ambi@@ que
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that glorious men could be in Moz@@ ambi@@ que &apos;s target of attacks .
&quot; photo : differently Bol@@ in / Flickr , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apped persons for the organ@@ ist , probably for ten@@ ant purposes , troubled the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Moz@@ ambi@@ que . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ k , a few kilometers from border to Malawi . &quot;
&quot; one of the victims was de@@ capit@@ ated , and some of the organs have been removed . &quot;
two men were arrested and subsequently stood that the organs of sham@@ ans are used in Tanzania and Malawi .
&quot; it may give the local super@@ sti@@ tions that the head of a man @-@ piece of gold could bring gold bi@@ old or wealth , explained the police spokes@@ person from Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia on the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on gl@@ atz@@ ers were registered in Moz@@ ambi@@ que .
another group that is the target of en@@ ord@@ ances for ob@@ sc@@ ure purposes are people with al@@ bin@@ ism .
this resulted in examining a mission in the South African country in order to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with Al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighbourhood of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight these super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudices . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Moz@@ ambi@@ que are the aim of ritu@@ alistic attacks which warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ que police following the latest qu@@ ord@@ ances of three glasses of strong men based on their physique .
&quot; two susp@@ ects , were arrested in the district Mil@@ k , where the m@@ ord@@ ances were taking place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ky Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabitants of the town of In@@ ham@@ bane in the south of Moz@@ ambi@@ que said that the local police have already asked the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the glorious men .
&quot; the persecution and assassination of glass @-@ strong individuals for extraction and selling of their organs in the district of Mor@@ per@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , for presumably the police of the Republic of Moz@@ ambi@@ que ( PR@@ M ) , which also assumed that a faith existed , according to which the victims were in mind , the riches of the labour . &quot;
during the last days three men were murdered with hair removal problems in this part of the country .
&quot; Angela Fer@@ re@@ ira Samantha divided on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blo@@ gger arms Sn@@ ai@@ pp@@ a , who pointed out that the problem is part of the larger social difficulty in which Moz@@ ambi@@ que faces : &quot;
&quot; I would like to ask E@@ IN Moz@@ ambi@@ que , DAS S@@ ICH , in which the people would have ashamed to go on the streets , and other services , a nation in which people would hurt honest notes , and other services , a nation in which neither the Al@@ bin@@ os nor cat or &quot; black magic &quot; were ch@@ ased to aim to get her own wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seriousness of the phenomenon , some of the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ ren humour could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Moz@@ ambi@@ que , and avi@@ d Twitter virtu@@ es , twe@@ et that both the head of the district Mor@@ t@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ange , as well as the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , both gl@@ atz@@ ro@@ fig are : &quot;

free bas@@ sel : Ne@@ ver Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at in December 2012 ( in English ) Neu@@ n reactions of the international community to medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o
a photo by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia which was probably made recently .
this story was originally published on 8 July 2017 on Hong Kong Free Press .
the following version is published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent Chinese Dis@@ si@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o drew attention in the international community after his lawyer by the end of June had announced that he was delivered to hospital because of liver cancer in the end stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years in prison for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; after having participated in the draft of the Charter 08 , a manifes@@ to that demands the democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China referred to as &quot; an internal matter &quot; and a speaker tells , he did not take it as &quot; &quot; not required to discuss this issue with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to call up calls from the international community , the Nobel Prize winner and his wife , Di@@ chter@@ in Li@@ u X@@ ia , release or give it a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the Pa@@ ares in Beijing , others are completely off the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has compiled some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the High Commissioner for Human Rights , met at the end of June Chinese officials in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a speaker refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to aid Li@@ u abroad for treatment . &quot;
Norway Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Secretary of Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Bren@@ de have refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway was ho@@ oked , after the Nobel Peace Prize in 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian Government claimed that this is ultimately nothing to do with decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued until December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement in order to resume the salmon of salmon to China since the exports have been largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; once the message had spread that Li@@ u was seriously damaged , the Nobel Committee brought its hope for a unconditional release to express and lu@@ d Li@@ u to pick its price in Oslo . &quot;
because of its imprisonment he was not able to uph@@ ill his price .
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July the European Parliament passed a decision to free from the house , Li@@ u and his wife immediately from the house arrest , and permit him to seek medical support where he wants . &quot;
&quot; finally , China &apos;s top diplom@@ at of the EU , Federica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us on how she ins@@ isted in a statement on 30 June . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we are expecting that China lifts all the restrictions of Mr Li@@ us wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they wish , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; U.S. Ambassador Ter@@ ry S@@ stad shared with that the Americans &quot; &quot; wish him &quot; &quot; that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , insofar as he may help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; spokes@@ person in the U.S. Embassy in China , Mary in the Pol@@ ley , gave the message agency AF@@ P on June 27 , giving the message to release the Chinese authorities , not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from their house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the U.S. Embassy moved an angry answer from China , with the utter@@ ance of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; no country have the right to interfere and un@@ answer@@ able remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley shared with that China should offer the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom such as travel free movement and access to medical care of his choice , to which it is entitled according to Chinese constitution and judicial system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Fro@@ ley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision to press the Chinese government to release the Chinese government on it , Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I call China to un@@ condition@@ ally release the Nobel Prize winner # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he has known himself into a proper medical treatment . htt@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany
&quot; the German government speaker Steff@@ en Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3rd , Berlin hope that Li@@ u &quot; won all the medical support he needed &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese President X@@ i Jin@@ ping was released on 7 and 8 July at the G20 , in Hamburg . &quot;
previously announced diplomatic sources in Beijing the message agency Re@@ uters that China had great concerns if the vor@@ tex could over@@ see the visit in Hamburg .
Canada
on 28 June the Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um China called for appropriate medical care to provide adequate medical care and giving him the opportunity to take care of his family .
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P before that Li@@ us woman , Li@@ u X@@ ia , who could visit him every day , but the police are always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not allowed with anyone outside , including his lawyers , to speak and contact . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um talks on :
&quot; Canada calls China on its international human rights commitments , including free speech , to preserve and release the rights of these rights . &quot;
France in France
&quot; by France &apos;s Foreign Ministry , China called for China to release a statement on 29 June on Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o gets all treatments , which he , regardless of where , needed . furthermore , his wife and family can have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news sen@@ ders France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was announced that there is no further information out whether France will eventually pick him up . &quot;
Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of the Council affairs in Taiwan called on June 27 to release Li@@ u and to demonstrate a greater tolerance of those who require peaceful means for political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
the Tai@@ wan@@ ese regul@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Party Party also called for China to allow the sick intellectual light to treat in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leaders in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , showed himself very concerned in an explanation on 28 June by Li@@ u and gave me that many have asked him to pray for Li@@ us &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had strictly punished , to a harmon@@ ic , stable and prosperous China , had contributed to a peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged , when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , the Charter of 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and the rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am should be considered as a city in Singapore . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osph@@ ere .
&quot; during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York , the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supportive that Singapore was to be regarded as a city .
no @-@ one has questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice , &quot; turning its logic to defend the existing author@@ itarian practice of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrific@@ ed to create this valuable country , we hear that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the semb@@ lance of escape from the responsibilities , a mandatory infringement . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons made by Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it he seemed un@@ disturbed . &quot;
&quot; however , he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York should be compared , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the issue , the good old ly@@ re of the author@@ itarian rulers appear to be the prevailing logic , as they fit better into their power . &quot;
&quot; in the final week , the last week of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
related questions will be related to non @-@ answers of rational kind .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng is calling for Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am to tell his opinion , because she didn &apos;t understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally think it &apos;s a bit difficult to swal@@ low .
&quot; in Singapore no country , but a city is , thus to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I understand nothing . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our appreci@@ ative K Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am would take the effort to clear that point , if he was paid highly , to be part of the government of the city of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by announ@@ cing his comment on the blog , he notes regarding the reviews that one should begin to read the entire trans@@ cription of the conference , so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , according to which Singapore was a city and not a country . &quot;
read the trans@@ cript .
&quot; he said that Singapore was more like a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he said why the elections in Singapore are as insignificant , even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he held Singapore with cities in the United States ( and how many of these cities were winning a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; he said , Singapore &quot; &quot; is not a country , &quot; &quot; he obviously does not mean it in that sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , who is a leader in a growing generation , such a polem@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said , very ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expect - would I agree with them or not , but that is another matter . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am , a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore , I have doubts and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the Tem@@ as@@ ek review sets the weaknesses of Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; , &quot; or was it a bol@@ d@@ scher speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , which country would go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is equally land and city . &quot;
&quot; since it plays an important role within the government of the cabinet , the statements made by Mr Shan@@ mu@@ g@@ am are of severe importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the hunters have their military service , they only defend their city but not their land ? &quot;
who must pay our Prime Minister bills ?
what is the value of our pink pay@@ roll ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; tends to Jour@@ ney of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore and always was a city : &quot;
&quot; I have not told what I said ... &quot;
this set seems to have anno@@ yed many of its strength ...
nobody ever told that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements such as &quot; &quot; defense of the country above all &quot; , &quot; but that is not entirely correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the city &apos;s defense .
myth of &quot; nice Kan@@ adi@@ ers &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Fl@@ anders .
scre@@ enshot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices asked recently his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect about your home or home country ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of a continuous series , with the rum@@ ors of certain parts of the world to be revealed and another fac@@ et shall be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question which is most asked me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I am sorry . &quot; I am coming from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation taking place in the situation , it is considered to be polite , interest in his conversation , by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; then , mostly the default answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Eis@@ ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Can@@ adi@@ ans may be bo@@ dying from anger , if they are held for Americans , but don &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Can@@ adi@@ ans of Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Can@@ adi@@ ans see a Canadian flag well visible in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all dear Can@@ adi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ...
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , the invasion of Iraq and the 11th September . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le blades at their luggage in order to differ from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care !
with us there is no weapons !
homo@@ sexual marriages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
&quot; all seem to think , Canada is so great . &quot;
we are polite .
&quot; obviously , we are saying very often &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered as the most tolerant country in relation to ethnic groups .
we are not like these types south of the border .
we Can@@ adi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first , I have many American friends who I admired . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t make anything if one would change me with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ulu .
&quot; but there are also some problems with the stamps &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; first : as a &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; to be said , is basically to be true , gentle , but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Fl@@ anders from &quot; &quot; Simp@@ son &quot; &quot; ( who has a own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤nger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Fl@@ anders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing in which you can come across . &quot;
&quot; being harmless , means in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and no attention to earn . &quot;
&quot; this can be something good , if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even come to say , to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major property of Can@@ adi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to just take care of our own affairs .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders as &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Can@@ adi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with the neighbors .
&quot; we are lacking the warm , open friendliness that I am now connecting with my American friends . &quot;
thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) then J@@ ustin Tru@@ de@@ au entered the stage to show that Can@@ adi@@ ans are more than just &quot; nice &quot; . our prime minister has made Canada down@@ right sexy .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ iled Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video published in Thailand has released a music video that took the Jun@@ ta , which took power in 2014 and restore the civilian government in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) the band tat@@ too Col@@ our describes a young man who tells of it , what rules he makes his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; although not expressly politically , the music video refers directly to the ongoing military power of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was an amazing success .
&quot; within the first three days , this was shared by Facebook up@@ loaded video 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8.@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin @-@ Video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists called the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , particularly as it beha@@ ves on the state of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; once again , look at these recordings of the video related to some of the political topics that Thailand has per@@ secuted in the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ ined section 44 of the provisional constitution , giving an absolute decision to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army as absolute decision @-@ making . &quot;
&quot; 11 . rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the in@@ famous program for &quot; setting change &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other individuals who are regarded as critics of the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose v@@ ague and un@@ clear rules are often exploited by the authorities to susp@@ end activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was established in the army , supervised the online content , and individuals who pre@@ thrown , the monarchy will be sl@@ ander@@ ed . &quot;
Thailand pres@@ upp@@ oses a stri@@ pper against &quot; lo@@ ese Maj@@ ors &quot; ( Maj@@ estic ins@@ ult ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , the War II was established in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a put@@ sch of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the jun@@ ta continued to follow is their decision to buy expensive U @-@ boats , although san@@ itation they warned that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video even more , how people will be thrown into a black hole car before moving them into an inter@@ ni@@ cal storage facility , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they said supposedly &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users will face long detention centres , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , who im@@ it@@ ated the Sal@@ ute from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em &quot; , &quot; which was already used by put@@ sch opponents during the protests of 2014 . &quot;

&quot; the post @-@ war society reco@@ vers only very slowly in East @-@ East Asia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; now over 20 years have passed since the Georgian @-@ ab@@ err@@ atic war was officially ended , but its s@@ cars are still heavily visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the deserted villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show distinctive images .
&quot; villages like D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ th@@ aya Sha@@ kh@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ Chi@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carbon basin . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , sh@@ lands , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians , and worked together in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and Ab@@ ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called Ge@@ ister@@ on in Ab@@ ch@@ sia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in this gh@@ ost . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for sp@@ herical .
&quot; since 2011 the total population of the district in 16@@ ,000 people had barely risen up over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

the first five @-@ story room@@ mate of the Soviet Union from the early 60s called Chr@@ u@@ sch@@ t@@ Ã©@@ kow@@ kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are obsol@@ ete and are rarely inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native older man .
&quot; he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; all this is a consequence of war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; Why talk ? &quot;
nevertheless it is clear . &quot;
in front of war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gart@@ ens who served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splendor @-@ buildings .
&quot; the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union , have abandoned the district . &quot;
in the gh@@ ost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha live for about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ chev , which are still one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where laundry . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately pull back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to photograph us , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply has forbidden us , this is all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pering her girlfriend something and suddenly she left the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small tur@@ quoise mining enterprise called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ s@@ istence farming ( cultivation of agricultural products for personal needs ) such as cattle farming , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it is difficult to reach rounds .
the District management delivers free candles and bread in winter to the villages .

&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or T@@ ante G@@ alya worked as it is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Gen@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite their el@@ dest daughter who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left before Ab@@ ch@@ sia to live with her . &quot; &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ ch@@ sia &quot; , &quot; she tells . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to accept financial aid from her daughter and insist that she will support her young grand@@ son instead .
Gal@@ inas monthly r@@ ents are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very difficult to survive . &quot;
aun@@ t G@@ alya told that she and other villagers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
if holidays are we visit us .
but we cannot do that constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; calls aun@@ t G@@ alya her . &quot; she said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I already prepared the ground .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what is going to happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ as convers@@ ational Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and her five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they remember the village of thor@@ n before the war .
&quot; in spite of the relative , that live in central Russian , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ ch@@ sia were simply away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

Nat@@ ascha gets about $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband is working in the fashion jewellery .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asch@@ as kinder@@ garten was once found , keep them pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chickens . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark street or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it is rather something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right .
every day I remember the city and war once were .
when our conversation arose to the end a little boy is passing by us .
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hidden .
a ball flies from the window and another boy ch@@ ased him behind him .
he plays with the ball that rolls up the hill .
a group of children now write the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones at the dec@@ ayed building . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood who are caring for in@@ ti@@ ghtness in their lives .
they do not know it any other way .

in Mexico &quot; Mama Africa &quot; migrants &quot; migrants on their long journey
&quot; Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by Amy Br@@ ack was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PR@@ I.@@ org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; across the way of migrants , across Europe or Latin America , certain places for their hospitality are known . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he is on the border of Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is headed by a 5@@ 9@@ - year@@ old Mex@@ i@@ can@@ ine , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bril@@ liance and gold @-@ coloured ear@@ rings in t@@ ed@@ dy bears form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name of Mama Africa . &quot;
this nickname is the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ ti@@ ans who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rots in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , the people are told in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call : &quot; mom &quot; Africa ! &quot;
where are you mom@@ my Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at present it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also already slept on cardboard boxes . &quot;
you do not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick , they buy them medicines that they cannot pay , they mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ sam , from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived a short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if mom is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ en ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ sta@@ che ) pos@@ ing with Concep@@ ciÃ³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : Amy Br@@ ack .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
&quot; Sebasti@@ en travels with his sister , who hopes to get to Boston where she can find her husband and the three children . &quot;
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to normally take a first stop in South America and then move towards north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companion of Mama Africa . &quot; Mama Africa is a famous name on the track , &quot; &quot; Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that the Hai@@ ti@@ ans and Afri@@ cans often travel the track together and that the Afri@@ cans were already speaking on W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companion , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil beforehand and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy has weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
&quot; for months he has been a guest at Mama Africa : he sells SIM cards to save the required money , to buy the ticket ticket to Ti@@ ber . &quot;
I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always keep in touch . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez tells her guests her often to send text messages when they continued to greet them or to tell her about the course of her journey .
they explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work .
&quot; she does not know much about Africa , but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula .
&quot; on the other end of the city , there is a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela . &quot;
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a poli@@ cem@@ an and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants would be sold too expensive .
&quot; he has started to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; for the moment 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ ti@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the ground , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are doing .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; &quot; he tells . &quot; I have experienced what they experience . &quot;
I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s the reason why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived there for three years , he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travels through Tap@@ ach@@ ula , comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©@@ n@@ dez tells me that he was flo@@ wn in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money from him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula it is in demand of an accommodation and an unknown , one single @-@ setting , has offered him its roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests .
in the courses the travelers consult with their phones .
a mini@@ bus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to most of Somalia .
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but it is also nostal@@ gically , because of those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud Grand@@ mother she blows her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair ties that made her a customer satisfaction , some photos of her grand children and many travellers more , boy and Old . &quot;
they laugh so sad@@ dened while she pre@@ fers me briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; she repe@@ ats each time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;

&quot; on July 10 , the cell phone in the Ti@@ an@@ shan District of the city Ur@@ um@@ qi received a cell notification in which it points the District government , a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; web cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the message is said that the App &quot; &quot; is to give access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities use the app to be used for more than the fight against terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report on Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous I@@ li Kaz@@ ak@@ h pre@@ fecture , because they had installed just after they replaced the app , exchanged news with a private We@@ chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police stood that the app can identify and trace the sources and distribution paths of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ st website describes the app as follows :
J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service performance with system categories for children and adults introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om .
&quot; the main function is to restore por@@ no@@ graphi@@ cally websites , from online fraud , Tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to alert users how much time they spend online and remot@@ ely control their own home network . &quot;
this app with the filters for min@@ ors is supposed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
&quot; of course , an app with these functions can of course be used in a diverse manner . &quot;
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote &quot; state actors or even h@@ acker can manipulate the home network of a person or to ste@@ al from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to take control of digital activities in this region .
&quot; while reports about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , the reality is very often dark for those who live in remote , aff@@ licted ethnic minorities such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit the distur@@ ban@@ ces and dis@@ content in conflict areas , the authorities often classi@@ fy extreme cens@@ ors and monitoring measures as well as rout@@ in@@ em@@ ant Internet circuits . &quot;
&quot; the news based on Twitter based media out@@ let &quot; Images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( which can be posted from a check@@ point , at the poli@@ cem@@ an , as well as un@@ checked by the poli@@ cem@@ an , whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang App .
&quot; &quot; &quot; a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days . &quot;
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be de@@ tained by up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
&quot; they have forced the people to use equipment , which are intended for older people . &quot;
this is a form of imprisonment by The rest of The Hague .
we are back in ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from Main@@ land China &quot; ( perceive from the rate of this date , which also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can lift up the labelling requirement of a Windows operating system and therefore receive full access to the hard drive of your computer . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and mobile phones are used in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang to electronic manual .
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may possibly provide a response to the instructions of the city council to minimize the spread of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and with the party , including universities and research institutions are oblig@@ ated to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security office when operating their computer and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a current report of Freedom House , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities released on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi , a regulation with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs , up to 1 August their &quot; personal ID cards , cell phones , external drives , portable hard disk , not@@ ebooks , and media storage cards . &quot;
&quot; the intention is to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos &quot; and destroy them . however , this promotion viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a whole range of other possible causes , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cry for death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane illustrates his experiences in an Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and set out that you are alone in a place where all things disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has been dissolved and un@@ resolved and un@@ veiled a truth which is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one who makes her name all glory .
one who has put down in a list of feelings and expressions that no metaph@@ ors allow .
&quot; but when you get the reality again , and behind the curtains - beyond the actor , the beautiful scenes and the performer - turn the characters into beings from flesh and blood , and all cry out to death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts can be resolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the earth is spinning on the axis of the in@@ healing . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grandparents , stone built around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that didn &apos;t have any thing to do so I mean &quot; &quot; my lesson , &quot; &quot; as the head of the security service , it would be form@@ at@@ ted - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
&quot; he placed his power over us , that he even destroyed the simplest concepts we knew . &quot;
five young people were torn down during a peaceful protests such as we@@ eds from the beautiful garden of our revolution .
&quot; it was enough to make the city the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all city districts , only my own not . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , reg@@ im@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I found no high demands on a town that has moved to the arteries with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night things had cal@@ med down somewhat , after the power supply in the neighborhood had to work . &quot;
&quot; I broke the still@@ ness , by crying out several times &quot; &quot; All @-@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice out of the silence contradic@@ ting .
&quot; a few minutes later , some of my friends felt brave enough to together . &quot;
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we were talking about a beautiful picture , that filled my expectations and completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you realize that you are free the spirit from the lamp , but it is simply not interested in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father , &quot; &quot; makes you ready , we meet with the military security building . &quot;
he lay on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swal@@ low - nothing can withdraw your voice , after you put them all the way up to the office of the security service from the body . &quot;
I came there .
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Ober@@ st Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me hear me , as thou shou@@ ld@@ est cry out , or you are only brave enough to cry when we are not in the proximity . &quot;
his h@@ ash @-@ filled eyes rose on me .
&quot; and you don &apos;t know , what to look in the eyes and not on the floor ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I was in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fol@@ ly , van@@ ity , perhaps to the revolution . &quot;
&quot; I was so sure of my cause when I said , &quot; I would not have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; and I think I have never stopped to look at your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I regret not a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; in sol@@ itary , and his father is equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father is equal to this . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the stri@@ fe of this con@@ flu@@ ence of this movement lies with me until today in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psych@@ ic torture , which I was exposed to months . &quot;
I am crying the farm .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; afterwards , through the yard and into the second office , which leads through one way to the single cells . &quot;
I &apos;m looking forward to reading all details just before I cared for the room .
otherwise they have a larger cell to me this time .
I have to share it with only one other prisoner and may immediately put me immedi@@ at@@ ly without waiting for her permission .
&quot; after a few minutes , who felt like a whole life , the officials left the cell , and I attacked on an old and proven communication method : to beat the wall against the wall . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cy@@ ber @-@ fin was a &quot; &quot; occupation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hesitation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently , in none of the surrounding cells was one of the middle age that looks similar to me and &quot; &quot; doctor &quot; &quot; is called . &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness can not be seen in my complete coun@@ tenance , and doctors do not exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
&quot; maybe someone , whose voice like my sounds like me ? &quot;
all the answers are one of his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had insur@@ es me , they would not hate him if I stay . &quot;
Li@@ ar .
&quot; I would have liked to have a bird , in order to ban@@ ish all these cro@@ ws , which lab@@ eled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
from the distance I still hear &quot; All@@ ahu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ am .
it must be approximately 10 am in the evening ; always in order to get this time the scre@@ ams every day .
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of cal@@ am@@ ity , until I saw the yellow light which shows us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( about : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; An@@ spiel@@ ung on 13 s@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be questioned .
&quot; this was the secret to protect and prevent state security in order to protect the tra@@ itors and the terrorists in us , they speak in al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dial@@ ects - thus they played their sec@@ t@@ arian sound card and poured out the narrow eye view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which here is not a land ; it is a curse to call them coexistence to transform the criminals of their sound into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I cared for the inter@@ rog@@ ation and tre@@ et@@ ting on Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes before me . &quot;
&quot; he cap@@ tures a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the face press , which ent@@ ailed him , &quot; &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than you wish to join this diary and to protest on demonstrations that will eventually find an end anyway . &quot;
I answered not .
I used to get it used to answer .
I can really no longer say when insul@@ ts and blows become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary means of communication .
when and how this happened was un@@ important .
&quot; any voice in me said that I had to get used to it or to get used to it , although I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
on punishment in all their diversity .
its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this lovingly &quot; con@@ fession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your Hen@@ ker rejo@@ iced at your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure you with him , and you cannot res@@ hold your scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; my cry did not fall in him , so why she exchanged the pipe by a cable . &quot;
&quot; when I first asked me , I asked if the investig@@ ator had worked as a trash collection or if it belonged to the normal working equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined in order to present us the , from their perspective , great invention of a huge cab@@ al . &quot;
within one hour three of them usually came from while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feelings in my body - and my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noted the cooling and found no favour at all , which is why he finally reached an electric up@@ loaded wheel . &quot;
electricity flo@@ wed my entire body enough to supply my entire neighborhood .
&quot; my semi @-@ nude body , which lay down on the floor , was the perfect electricity leader . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night .
this must probably have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which happened to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room &quot; .@@ R@@ out with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father has to be fear@@ ful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; be quiet and walk you , you will be transferred . &quot;
this was new .
otherwise they had always been released .
where do they lead me away ? !
&quot; the j@@ ord@@ ani R@@ apper Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of the LGB@@ T@@ Q + community , free expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken from A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ s@@ all@@ am H@@ da@@ i@@ b spend most of his time in@@ doors ; sometimes he mu@@ te to his canvas , to his computer , and again also to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or its carot@@ ene lips .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967 ; the year , in which Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank , and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced themselves to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as fel@@ ah@@ edron ( about : Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their proven opinions on gender roles , sexuality and free expression through art and rap@@ music . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , but he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world . all these topics are not only found in his native Am@@ man relevance , but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind , and he can have compassion with the people who suffer under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not give it openly , he gets against the American foreign policy a special incl@@ ination . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b looks at his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b doesn &apos;t believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war @-@ areas to do anything with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees &quot; - so he himself , even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think that because I am a man , while he is poured into two cups . it is the holy month of Ramad@@ an ; during this time it is planned for Muslims , from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the law law also states that the public intake of food during Ramad@@ an are illegal . &quot;
&quot; obviously H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee in a sen@@ sing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
basically the sle@@ ds of hot coffee and the s@@ wa@@ ths of the cat cigarette in the nose first line of freedom .
&quot; at times , Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky , especially when you take a look into the neighboring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it simply avo@@ ids basic things to do - as to drink in public during Ramad@@ an water - in order not to land in jail . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry of Jord@@ ani@@ ens made an appearance of the band Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la already , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliamentary members who support the Islamic Programme of Action - the j@@ ord@@ an branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homo@@ sexual fron@@ ts of Ham@@ ed Sin@@ no , contradic@@ ted the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the S &amp; D spokes@@ person in the Islamic coalition D@@ IMA Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N , that the concert was said &quot; just &quot; because of the sexual orientation of the S@@ kan@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; many believe that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activ@@ ism that questioned the proven legitimacy of author@@ itarian regimes throughout the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la the &quot; &quot; progressive suppor@@ ter of human rights &quot; , &quot; which continued to stand for an intellectual and cultural plur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement may probably not be easy to track rhet@@ oric , but indeed a more evident reality in Jordan , which appears to be clearly visible in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs . &quot;
in 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b traditional gender standards too glue by playing his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have pre @-@ mar@@ ital sex .
&quot; the image shows the skel@@ eton of a clearly low @-@ established woman , whose arms and legs up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them .
in the past years Jordan has increased the number of &apos; Hon@@ orary mor@@ de &apos; - the un@@ official outside .
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of Hon@@ orary mor@@ de in 2016 reached its peak ; however , Jordan was still missing that Jordan has no institutional infrastructure to support the victims of murder or domestic violence , in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on fighting fight against the year 1954 , women who are subjected to risk of domestic violence , and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family need nothing to happen . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is well @-@ known for this , too , not to shy back on issues that lived in his country for a long time as tab@@ u . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , however , that he is his music , the full explicit ass@@ esses of sexuality , freedom and expression , cannot be separated from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was drawn into politics &quot; , &quot; he says . &quot;
in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b takes on the question of Palestinian identity .
in &quot; Lav@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus is on poverty .
&quot; the list of songs that are politically political , can be continued . &quot;
in March 2016 H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated often :
&quot; you are free , and any other it is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song , H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words &quot; that can be what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ sexuality or homo@@ sexuality . &quot;
&quot; he notices that hardly anyone talks in Jordan about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on the equality of LGB@@ T@@ Q + -@@ individuals will still be cens@@ ored up in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 H@@ da@@ i@@ b led an interview for the popular j@@ ord@@ an Online@@ program Ro@@ ya , to later realize that his comments from the context were torn down , and his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on Youtube it was up@@ loaded without cuts , but was only a revised version , &quot; says he . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b acqu@@ ires open to the arab@@ ic T@@ Q + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homo@@ sexu@@ als don &apos;t speak to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he mentions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who still has remained in mind thanks to its homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks : if Abu Nu@@ what , who later should work on behalf of the potassium , could write openly about homo@@ sexuality in the eighth century , why does Jord@@ an@@ ier do not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was canc@@ eled . &quot;
in the Has@@ hem@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Lebanese news service took several former government members and members of the educational association , with the reason they expressed themselves on comments in social media critical to the problems linked to deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the concert H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is said only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ an@@ ier . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress has been a continuous giving and taking . Jordan has made a performance to Mas@@ h@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time , but it looks like H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , depres@@ sing and internal changes . he is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Peruvian society . &quot;
&quot; finally , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams about how millions of other Arabs also , from a Arab world without interventions from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he dreamed not only to bring his work to Bagh@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region is going through music , art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs , streams and artificial kind of guided democracies . at least he hopes that . &quot;
&quot; so far , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the three biggest festivals in Japan .
these great , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors are so fantastic ! ! !
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is believed that there is a variant of Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually recorded in August in many areas of To@@ ho@@ cus . another theory asser@@ ts that the strongh@@ olds , the drum , and the tan@@ ces come over more than a thousand years ago and mar@@ ched from a period in the armies from the West of Japan to the northeast , to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to take a few great seats , so we got a great view . &quot;
you can only imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a joint centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , hosted a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( lit . ) &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two forti@@ fications are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only True - and a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Sommer@@ festival in the north of the country .
I was there and looked at the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high ceremony was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !

&quot; rarely , external appearance and body care was as important as in this history , as they help to keep away from the Peruvian youth from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like those of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Call@@ ao , Per@@ us most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , near the historic center of Lima &apos;s capital - a region with a very high crime rate , where street noise and illegal drug trading are all daily . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region did not feel safe .
Peru - like many other Central and South American countries are experiencing a growing demand for aesthetic services for men .
&quot; the trend , appearance , appearance and therefore also the fallen hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men like Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Brazil ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Brazil ) , or Ne@@ ym@@ ar ( Brazil ) , has resulted in getting more normal citizens in the experienced hands of hair@@ styles that can form these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of fantasy and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of Fris@@ alla de Barber@@ os , which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts will compete against each other to show who can create the exact looks like you can see in the following video ( further videos on current cont@@ ests , there are Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Barber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Call@@ ao , found here an opportunity to convince young people who receive their arms against hair@@ dressing tools and instead of poor ratings to receive training in hair art which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the offering opportunities , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job which is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school was commen@@ cement of special training workshops in March and reported on some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only professional school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because from love for the children we have built this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : love letters to guer@@ rilla warfare

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the working version of the paper &quot; &quot; love bot@@ h@@ ers &quot; &quot; on guer@@ rilla warfare , &quot; which has released the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
this article is published here within a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love notes to people we know ?
&quot; is it not yet much more important , people who have evolved to offer affection ? &quot;
this question was about the two young Colom@@ bian activists by the Stiftung Bogot@@ a and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os by the Young @-@ Youth @-@ Foundation not more from the head and inspir@@ ational her to the campaign Cart@@ as p@@ or la Re@@ j@@ li@@ aciÃ³n ( letters to reconciliation ) who urged young people to write letters .
&quot; recently her country was sw@@ aying a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part of it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ rilla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary forces in Colombia ) , which forms the junction point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
international was considered to be the sign of the peace treaty as significant that the Colom@@ bian president JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize .
&quot; however , prior to the Colom@@ bian , there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ rilla warfare , who lived for many years in illegal bearings , were exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carried out around the clock their weapons , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; Colom@@ bian society in turn , in turn to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ rilla warfare , must take in its ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young colum@@ bi@@ ans must join together and would have to help with the integration process .
and that &apos;s what they did : up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love hands on former guer@@ rilla warfare to welcome them back in society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ rilla war - which should then be given personally .
the Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bogot@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . there &apos;s Leonardo and Cr@@ istian the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ y@@ ar@@ thi in which 2014 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we love the people who love , Valentine &apos;s Day , write thousands of love letters , but those forget that they need much needed . &quot;
&quot; he plane , he told further to share his love with people this year , which needed the most urgent . &quot;
&quot; thus , the plan , letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now find their place in society and to establish a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse from a war story to a common history of peace . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Barran@@ qu@@ illa and Bogot@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
&quot; I had never thought that someone would forgive me &quot;
the first 500 letters were handed over to the region of Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students of the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the city administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogot@@ a have been moved to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
members of F@@ ARC presented themselves as they had done before to face the commands of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no prec@@ ep@@ ts , but the letters full of people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between , &quot; &quot; told the policy science @-@ student Manuela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
Sandra Par@@ ra , an assistant of the Govern@@ ors of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after we had passed the letters , a former fighter led me to the camp of guer@@ ri@@ llas fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bu@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut , in which the guer@@ rilla warfare ) saw , I saw a guer@@ illa which wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed a M@@ GL @-@ pom@@ e@@ aves , a deadly weapon in the bush @-@ sh@@ red@@ dish . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless I said to him and asked , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing right ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; I answered a letter , which someone wrote me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hope@@ ful letter .
&quot; never in my life has written someone something so nice , so I answered . I suddenly got the tears over the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ e@@ gran@@ ary .
&quot; perhaps he was not the war , I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters , and he wanted to help him to write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he never had anything else expected of life than war . he had never imagined anything from life as war . himself , the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger . &quot; &quot; I had never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there that is awaiting us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have only learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reigns , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; to the start @-@ up , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC came to a discussion . &quot;
&quot; the students were all raised up as a war , and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leader of the F@@ ARC , the history of the organization , their ideals , and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years now , we have experienced how the social injustice through the state has resulted in the entire Colom@@ bian people . now , where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party , we can contribute to shaping the society in this country . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this order , it is worth to overcome all obstacles , &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manuela was impressed :
&quot; listening to these people who had never heard heard before and had no voting right , and to realize that the people I often saw as Monster and even hate even humans with beautiful feelings , which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; reality , in which the land lives , does me hurt . &quot;
&quot; but it comfor@@ ted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage , we can teach us some and give a smile and a hug . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gust@@ avo Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example , Dar@@ Ã­o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Arch@@ bishop of the city of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
colum@@ bi@@ ans was prophes@@ y that after dra@@ in@@ age peace would reign .
but that is not the case .
&quot; as long as it is inequality , hunger and a lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to attack arms and protest for their rights and that is also completely justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now focus on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; therefore we call upon all defen@@ ders of peace - no matter which race , religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; homo@@ sexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ ca@@ sian region , are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
with terror activists have experienced the coverage of the past few months about the persecution of sw@@ ings in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but the threat , which , like a Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ hop on the LGB@@ T@@ Q community , is not only written overnight . &quot;
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to speak with a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of their experiences with us and talked to us about what is happening in the Republic . &quot;
&quot; the LGB@@ T@@ Q @-@ law in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published , the dis@@ appearances , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the first report was published by the journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in the No@@ wa@@ ja Gas@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities , which took da@@ ined que@@ er men soli@@ ds and they hid in secret prisons in Ar@@ gun . &quot;
&quot; you have brought a monster to the world , &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a Trans@@ woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; already since their childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for them , why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after having experienced a group of Ch@@ echn@@ ya of the sexually in@@ ox@@ es of their Land@@ s@@ ine , the hunt was opened on Sab@@ rina . &quot;
&quot; from fear for their lives , they passed the end to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was working as a volunteer assistant at a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend of D@@ ag@@ est@@ an , a trans@@ lady who tasted in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hesitation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone made from which I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread them anywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of mine . he squee@@ zed it to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made their way through the whole W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just going to show a few shopping bags from the back@@ seat of my car , I heard a men &apos;s voice : &quot; &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard one sentence , but this time at Che@@ chen : &quot; how long will you still be dish@@ on@@ ned the family , you Sch@@ and@@ stain ? &quot;
I knew the person not .
&quot; I only know that there was a young man , no 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up the last end in the hospital .
&quot; apparently some women had everything occasionally , and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man was flo@@ wn .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
in the hospital I learned that I had two key@@ boards in my right lungs .
OC Media : in which hospitals were you placed - in those of the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , that &apos;s my male name , but the doctor did understand and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very grateful for this .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I got it to do with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a cau@@ dal name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for it to be respectful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I got threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - Rel@@ ated , foreig@@ ner , some completely unknown . &quot;
this was the beginning of a nightmare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives .
&quot; the demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
they created absurd demands : some said to me , I need to prove it by running out above without the roads , others wanted that I was not changed at the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I was not changed my sex , that everything was just bad , and Photoshop . &quot;
I have KÃ¶r@@ ber size C - what should I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still hard for them .
some older people spoke my mother on the streets .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world not only of your family , but the whole of the Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; so , my mother became too much and she lay a stri@@ ck around the neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car was filled with dark windows and a num@@ eric plate with a 95 .
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was a bit lazy . &quot;
my human rights friends over @-@ tested the numer@@ ical signs - it turned out that I was per@@ secuted .
OC Media : how did you have fled ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I do not want to give up their names , but I will say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help I left the country , but then something happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought it without having to register , without permission , without any anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash .
came and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my cell phone .
&quot; in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe , you heat in security , just because you leave the country ? &quot;
&quot; our people already know , in which hotel you st@@ eck@@ el . you even know your room number . &quot;
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in touch with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about the sex @-@ equation we are not talking , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
some traditional k@@ au@@ kas@@ ic elements are still working in me .
&quot; so much I also wish , this spiritual barrier can I not overcome . &quot;
&quot; I am always saying that , as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to hurt them . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually give me effort to look like the person who reminded them of their past - thus to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed dor@@ ms ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : last week I submitted a report in Washington .
for the necessary I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information about the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
I spoke to someone who has sent one and a half months in Ar@@ gun .
&quot; he told that during Ramad@@ an were not arrested and tor@@ tured , but also that all the end of Ramad@@ an could hardly wait , and he did not shut down a new wave . &quot;
most likely they are now concentrating on family and relatives .
&quot; so I mean , they probably invite the relatives to which they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honour &quot; has experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there still s@@ wa@@ ist men to be recorded in this secrecy ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there were just not many .
&quot; if , then especially those who have no rich relatives , or have been dropped from their relatives to place Kad@@ y@@ rows Court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are stuck there so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say : if they are killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim them , they could have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not simply disappeared , they have sub@@ merged yet to be radic@@ alised . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is this now just a mut@@ ation , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just met someone who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun and a half @-@ month .
he says that many people were gone to prison after having grown beard .
there has since been nothing new of them .
they just took them with them .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person himself was , when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; however , until now , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , so far there were no reports . we suggest that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why else could you not have allowed this man to shave ?
&quot; do you know if these per@@ secu@@ tions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of men who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation , already taking place in the past ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I always carried my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think that before 2003 I was already quite known when I lived there - and I never had any problems .
in the Ernst !
&quot; from 1998 to 1999 when the sh@@ aria was considered , I had never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than it is now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally wanted to bring us to the &quot; &quot; civil war &quot; &quot; but ultimately has thrown back into the stone @-@ time . &quot;
OC Media : what is possible under the sh@@ aria law ?
Sab@@ rina : my eyeb@@ rows were exhausted ; I had colored lashes . tube for jeans or short sle@@ ops .
the Security Ministry of sh@@ aria has never che@@ ered me just a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people like me met . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew thereof ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been insul@@ ted .
in the Che@@ chen language there is a phrase : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is : &quot; Sp@@ otte does not mean the un@@ happiness of another .
they often say to children when they make fun on the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never sinned , never hun@@ ted , never hun@@ ted . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace be held ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ row came to the plan .
&quot; once he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister , he began to talk about morality in television . &quot;
&quot; he does not talk about us per se , but above the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless - you could feel , how the people in the city began to change . &quot;
&quot; who caught up before and had eight , looked at once with suspi@@ cion . &quot;
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel the situation in the Republic of the Republic was constantly worse . &quot;
OC Media : what activity are you going on now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much .
&quot; apart from that , I am still working as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teac@@ up , gather@@ ings , I understand them to the hospital and help them to get ess@@ ences . &quot;
I do not have a pen@@ ny for them .
I discovered these people myself when I cl@@ assy .
I am Mus@@ lima and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : this is silly .
&quot; thus , nature has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ echn@@ ya , who want to know you with foam before the mouth , that there is no g@@ ays among them . &quot;
&quot; the D@@ ag@@ est@@ an@@ ans have which , the cab@@ ine have which , the Russians have also which ; on the whole planet , there are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear . &quot;
I come here so many men from the Caucasus .
&quot; many of them - practicing Muslims , who go to the mosque and during Ramad@@ an - live together with men . &quot;
&quot; you know many thinking about transi@@ tions to men who love men , and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different types of feeling , to be exact , different settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body .
don &apos;t know if I have a partner or not .
&quot; I &apos;m sorry that I will be here personally , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself .
local groups warn of a rise of self @-@ murder within the impover@@ ished Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty @-@ rate among the native Arab population .
&quot; &quot; &quot; for the past few months , there has been a strong rise in self @-@ mor@@ als . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was made available by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27th , backward the situation of the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi community in Iran , which is characterised by poverty and unemployment , in the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he dwelt in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own helpl@@ ess@@ ness that can arise in@@ capacity to his family , such as Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Human groups who want to work and remain anonymous in Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; a video made on YouTube held the moments , after he had lighted himself . &quot;
&quot; some people managed to clear the flames again , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought into the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the inc@@ iner@@ ations were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more . &quot;
he died shortly later .
&quot; it was not the only su@@ icide that has occurred in August within the Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi minority , and activists is on site warn that even more men could take the life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ w@@ azi Centre for Human Rights held that this month several others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , S@@ ayed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family members who felt helpl@@ ess and in@@ able because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government , helpl@@ ess and in@@ able to feed their families and to pursue a safe work . &quot;
Arab Ah@@ w@@ azi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , in which much of the Arab allies live in Iran , was shaken by a profound economic crisis which makes it difficult for the local Arab population to live their living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the arab@@ ic Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ahl@@ avi @-@ Mon@@ archy took over power and under@@ took great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest in Iran in the coming oil and gas fields , as well as some of the most powerful and most valuable crops for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population remains only little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often victims of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Iranian regime has denied the Ah@@ w@@ azi Arabs systematically work stations in local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industry . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s that lie water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have led only to devast@@ ate the devast@@ ation in the region by dr@@ unk@@ en@@ ness , and to destroy the local agriculture as well as the fish and palms industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab A@@ haw@@ k young people rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Direc@@ torate General for Ko@@ operative , Work and Social Wel@@ fare , announces that 5 % of the Ah@@ w@@ az@@ is who are looking for a job , completed 55 % a leading school and have 45 % a university degree . &quot;
systematic strategy ... that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ w@@ azi @-@ Human activ@@ ist with residence in London , told Global Vo@@ ices , that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and rac@@ ist ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of self @-@ murder among young Ah@@ w@@ azi men . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ him@@ i said that especially unemployment has recently become worse . because of this , a combination of a high number of new ethnic and anti @-@ Arab discrimination is emerging : &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions do not pre@@ fers the Arab labour force , the local Arab government and access to work opportunities in all sectors is drawn . &quot;
this is a part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime that aims to destroy the spirit of national Resistance by young Arabs and force them to earn their living outside their home of Ah@@ wa@@ z .
&quot; there are people who had to change their predec@@ essors and sur@@ names in order to hide and prevent their affili@@ ation to the ancestors and so that even Arab names do not tolerate the workplace , consecr@@ ated the Arabic language or the carrying arab@@ ic clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the given circumstances , which have to endure the Arabic Ah@@ w@@ azi , proposing human rights activists , before the situation is explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for su@@ icide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and su@@ icide is avoidable .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , even with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Commons license .
the following article is a revised version of the opinion written by Ay@@ om@@ an@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as and originally published on the website Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as . the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions have expressed .
they can be read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminine , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists - with frustration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well @-@ thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminine and why we generally should be all femin@@ ists * .
&quot; for example , that women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epidemic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women live sooner or later in various areas of life to a smo@@ other ceiling , and discrimination based on sex still draws over through the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all of this is aware and known to me .
I am convinced that I am double and thre@@ e@@ fold .
I am a black woman .
&quot; yet , if I am speaking on skin colour , on racism , on black CIS women , on black transi@@ tions women , on black women in the LGB@@ T@@ Q community or on black women from the Diaspora , if I mention , in which way we have been physically , past@@ oral and verbal abuse , decide to remain silent in as well as outside the feminist movement , to mention many white femin@@ ists and white inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ale femin@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; but nevertheless , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift their voices and &quot; Kum@@ b@@ aya , &quot; my Lord &quot; to sing &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about it , that in addition to sexu@@ alised violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , that we are exposed black women to two times . &quot;
or that black women and women of other eth@@ ni@@ cities and their origin @-@ regions deserve less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girl and girls are often referred to school with a migration background more often than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres , and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have the same rights all men and all men of any skin color ; on the other hand , I cannot consider myself as a black woman , in whose centre the white woman stands , who ref@@ uses to refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist sphere , who always rejected me and countless other black women and rejected . &quot;
&quot; Luke &apos;s 1851 in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and also I refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical way a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alised essence . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to include group@@ ings , which also absorb our customs and customs , in order to advance its ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer seek to prove white women the importance of the over@@ cut of skin colour and gender . for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement total , no matter how many black women try to instruc@@ t them for a better . &quot;
&quot; although the inter@@ sec@@ tional Femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different homes a home and conf@@ esses itself from the white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
I prefer to get rid of myself fully and entirely by femin@@ ism and to tie myself to the movement of W@@ om@@ an@@ ism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman rather than a white feminist paradigm so stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly being celebrated as a novel phenomenon .
&quot; it is more important than ever , that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the sphere of being created by us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ em , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ ens : Rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing Education ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus : how we can defend ourselves ) by creating ourselves on our own way , in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural , mental , spiritual , physical , and even the spiritual elements can be re@@ vered , which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after they have read these lines , please inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a bl@@ ur@@ istic environment , I can up@@ lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as a part of this paradigm .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has not passed , nor ignored . &quot;
pad@@ lo@@ ling against pollution : the mission of a man to protect the rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; To@@ dd Re@@ ub@@ old was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine , which reports about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
&quot; over the past 7 years Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or in the can@@ oe - with a special concern through the Iraqi Kurdistan region . its mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow mus@@ a who explains us its relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on its church .
&quot; I absolutely wanted to do something for the river we lost when I was still a child , &quot; Mus@@ a says . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country have fear that the decades of war , the construction of dust , the pollution and the un@@ controlled development , will lead to a direct water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ Govern@@ mental Iraq Organization - an affiliate of Water@@ er Alliance - who is committed to protecting and supporting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video Mus@@ a brings the urgency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we have no water , how would we survive then ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced for En@@ sia by Em@@ ily Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , in Iraq , documentary film cinem@@ atic journalist , filmed and published . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is followed by a little remarkable sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of co@@ oper@@ atively vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with their help sup@@ pressed communities to tell their stories their stories . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and processed version of the article &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; of course . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ Ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ Ã© bin ) , which reported on violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned .
&quot; a police commander said A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez , that they had nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner who had become violent against violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship had passed some time and the police said , their statement would be put to the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; as another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed because of abuse , also the acoustic indicator of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez nothing . &quot;
some days later the second woman moved back their ad .
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women have re@@ funding at all once , they generally receive no support from the state . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women also depend financially dependent on men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be the victims of violence , sign up at all with law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; content 1 stro@@ kes and Statisti@@ cal 2 Inv@@ isible women and a judicial system , which is nothing short @-@ up of Paraguay : good approach , def@@ ective conversion of wounds and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mis@@ used , My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for comrades on the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ TV , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot; there are various indications and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
the figures available are however highly alar@@ ming .
&quot; in 2015 , at the District @-@ country @-@ head office 9@@ 600 ads went on account of domestic violence . at 70 % of it , it was about violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads were in the police of women .
&quot; there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace of peace . here , 86 % of the ads came here . &quot;
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women told that they were physically interfer@@ ing , 55 % of women spoke of psych@@ ic abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the par@@ agu@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; on any woman who is re@@ funded in Paraguay through psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; re@@ funded to any woman who is re@@ funded because of physical abuse , come two women who do not do so , &quot; she declared the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal off@@ ender , the prosecution authorities are not able to document the prosecution authorities as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; alone until August 2016 , journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women &apos;s su@@ icide in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
according to their estimates all ten days a woman dies because of violence by men .

invisible mis@@ ses and a judicial system that doesn &apos;t under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z was the strong friend of Carlos Vera , he ins@@ isted that she called his name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t really wanted to do that , but after all , this should be rep@@ ented for ever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer working with Carlos . but for two years she bore mental violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time , the most severe recognition : &quot;
I had never thought that I would be victims of abuse .
&quot; when I read earlier about it , I always thought that the only woman happens to be sub@@ servi@@ ced because they dec@@ eive themselves of violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that I would never happen .
Mari@@ ana useless social media to report about the mission through Carlos Vera .
&quot; without name them , she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his insul@@ ts and different attacks during their two @-@ year relationship , and told how he ins@@ ulated them . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos themselves . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically , whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had fallen by Carlos so long and left him not earlier . &quot;
&quot; it seemed almost that , as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had a certain degree of complic@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not of Paraguay , fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , in order to prove that their former partner they failed . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te CRE@@ O ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) that consists of women who are all victims of abuse .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Vict@@ ori@@ as case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
&quot; her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less . &quot;
then he began to beat her .
&quot; Vict@@ ori@@ as ads with the authorities were without a result and also of their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; it led a trial against its former partners who developed into an im@@ pregn@@ able legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and influence of their former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays La@@ ws : good approach , def@@ ective realization &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
the display of compounds is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary . &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos .
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay , also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was adopted in the par@@ agu@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # 8217 ; ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ Ein@@ e@@ Wen@@ iger ) is part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original design of the law fores@@ ees to explain the arbitrary criminal offen@@ se and harder to pun@@ ish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the legislative text in some points was altered to also gain members of the law so that the path for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions are paved , which in Paraguay have generally been prohibited and punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill was fores@@ een , most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) sur@@ geries which must carry the victims of violence by themselves , if they just need to refund and receive a safe accommodation to obtain the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri argued that the law is not effective , if the legis@@ lat@@ ure does not make sufficient financial resources available to it : &quot;
in Paraguay &apos;s abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relations .
&quot; here , a change must take place , so that violence does not see more than something normal . &quot;
&quot; in view of these facts , he complic@@ ates himself and contributes to the perpetrators of offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to re@@ funding for such a long time until abuse is no longer regarded as normal .
&quot; however , on 10 November 2016 , the law was adopted in par@@ agu@@ an Senate . previously , parts of the law were cancelled . among other things , a passage was canc@@ eled , which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are taken apart .
the section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; however , the del@@ e@@ tion of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; from parts of the law is considered a great retreat . &quot;

independent media continued in O@@ man to ban a paper after the ban on a newspaper
&quot; this website was blocked because of a &quot; &quot; fun@@ ct of the Information &quot; &quot; on the homepage of the &quot; &quot; bot@@ anic newspaper &quot; &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
more than a year ago the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arabic @-@ speaking newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the Sultan .
&quot; You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he was remaining a one year old sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other authors from Az@@ am@@ n , Ibra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court , later they came free again . &quot;
&quot; O@@ man has been ruling since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had stopped his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a state of state . &quot;
&quot; since then , he has been in addition to his role as the only Sultan , the most important offices in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , commander of the Defence Forces , Minister of Finance , Secretary of Foreign Affairs , Chairman of the Supreme Council for the planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the rule of the Sult@@ ans is marked by the pers@@ istence efforts of security forces , including freedom of press , including press freedom , limiting and human rights defen@@ ders , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists , to intimi@@ date and detention . &quot;
&quot; the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and are citizens , also activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the Az@@ am@@ n paper , its closing and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which since its inception 2007 was reported on corruption in O@@ man ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces Ibra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor , after in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 , was published an article entitled &quot; high @-@ ranking political parties to the judiciary . &quot; it was about corruption in the judiciary , and the interference of high @-@ level officials in judicial decisions . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused , judges of the Supreme Court in O@@ man to put pressure under pressure , to raise a sentence in a inheritance dispute . &quot;
edition of the Az@@ am@@ n on 26 July 2016 with a report on the front page with the title : &quot; high @-@ ranking parties bind hands of justice . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , he was arrested by Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , Member of the Board of Commission@@ ers , from the ISS before the Special Department and arrested in his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
on 9 August 2016 the ISS took the Vice @-@ editor You@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j who acts to Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is commemor@@ ations as Chief Editor .
&quot; the paper was closed to im@@ certain time after the Minister for the Minister had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper on all paths , including online , from 9 August 2016 forbidden . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , he took place the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i . &quot;
the judgment condemned the three journalists to prison guards and also denoun@@ ced the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned because of the disorder of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining of the press &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of an audience and s@@ lan@@ der . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of prison guards and mon@@ stro@@ ves in the amount of 3000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . moreover a one @-@ year employment ban was imposed against the two journalists .
&quot; al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine sentence in the amount of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after having found the use of &quot; &quot; information system for spreading material that could be a danger to public order &quot; &quot; was found guilty . &quot;
for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i a b@@ ail was fixed at altitude of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13 000 US dollars ) and was released on 22 August 2016 before the judgment of judgment .
&quot; at the appeal of Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , al @-@ Ha@@ j was sentenced to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari to six months imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 according to exile in his six @-@ month prison sentence in mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he was transferred to his one @-@ year sentence . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Appe@@ als also raised the decision of the State Department to conclude the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the court to resume Az@@ am@@ n , the newspaper looks like before attacks by the om@@ anic government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January the Information Minister granted the Minister , with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information was personally signed , in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months , and with which the Ministers presented another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to allow the publication of the newspaper again . &quot;
the enduring closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspapers are not the only cases in which O@@ man has recently been violated in the press .
&quot; for further violations , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine Mo@@ w@@ atin and the exercising of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to stop their operations . &quot;
&quot; because of the continuous closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to end the comprehensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
the Golf @-@ Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Rights for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls for the om@@ anic authorities : &quot;
1 . You@@ z@@ sef Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally release ;
&quot; 2 . creating a safe environment for the Az@@ am@@ n newspaper , so that their journalists can do their work . &quot;
3 . protect the press freedom in the country
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances ensure that human rights defen@@ ders and journalists in O@@ man can have their ri@@ ghtful human rights work , and without fear of pris@@ als , including judicial service activities . &quot;
&quot; the Golf Center for Human Rights ( Gulf Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization , the human rights defen@@ ders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries by promoting the opinion and freedom of unification and the right to gather peace@@ fully , supported and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ concep@@ tions
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ ors 2016 in Zambia and picture with its consent
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . this is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons for the need for medical research on @-@ site medical research : there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the particular medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis and malaria , in the poorest countries of Africa have far more serious impacts than elsewhere , and lack of investment for exploring these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem . &quot;
&quot; secondly , research , which is carried out by African scientists , in building its own research capacity in Africa . a major role for science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or is Director of the Center for research on infectious diseases in Zambia ( Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; he grew in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for academic studies in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he researched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. Warri@@ or talks about the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ concep@@ tions in the media about this research . &quot;
( disclaimer : Dr. Warri@@ or speaks as a private one ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( G@@ V ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it Warri@@ or RW : currently the focus of my work on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ bian national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : what do you think are the most important scientific papers in your country , and generally in Africa ? &quot;
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
r@@ w : there are no basic research here . we only bet solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always be benefici@@ ary instead of being the makers . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
G@@ V : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
r@@ w : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are differently encouraged .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : how is research infrastructure ?
which obstacles are there in your routine research that you did not have before ?
r@@ w : the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to ensure continuous supply of electricity , water and the Internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
G@@ V : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
r@@ w : there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; G@@ V : how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa , where should it focus on , and how can we support development ? &quot;
r@@ w : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , research of space , health care ( non @-@ transfer@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it very much . &quot;
&quot; G@@ V : can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; r@@ w : often it is the limited speed , things to do , and the required access to scientific expertise that are facing challenges . &quot;
&quot; the system that reviews articles can only be made available to payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limited the amount of available information and speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers will change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the En@@ si@@ a.com website , a magazine that reports about solutions to environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ th , the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronom@@ au@@ ts in the outer space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was done only by its own imagination and the question , how many sal@@ ads can get it . &quot;
&quot; but in the beginning of the 200@@ 0s , he noted that more and more sal@@ ads were patented , and that he was not able to use them further . &quot;
&quot; the patents are not only used for individual varieties , but also for specific properties such as resili@@ ence over diseases , a special Rot@@ or or green@@ ish leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more of such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or cart@@ on pieces . because of these trends , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts provide food safety for food production in the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia , Mor@@ ton still ch@@ asti@@ er salad , he now needs more , since its work is increasingly difficult due to ever more limitations . &quot;
it &apos;s like being lying in a river a b@@ ump in order to p@@ add@@ les .
&quot; so we have to do that right now , but it is a break with the breeding @-@ tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that this patents go too far at Sal@@ ads . &quot;
&quot; and when they stand in court , no one can breed any new let@@ tu@@ ce , because all the features are already patented , and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and throughout the world : open source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space @-@ station ISS have bred the red Roman sal@@ at of the sort Out@@ red@@ horn in the &quot; greenhouse . &quot; the station is bred and eaten there it will be tested whether plants grown in space .

&quot; it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this , as if the movement from the IT area date back and not from the field of plant breeding . &quot;
the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open @-@ Source &quot; seed ) can be inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software .
&quot; it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property , and so are usable for plant breeders . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the initiative , named Os@@ si , U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can freely use seeds from them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds , and sell them . &quot; open source &quot; breeders allow only others to breed their seeds , to breed so own varieties , and it is not immediately audi@@ tory - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ors . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor of the University of Wisconsin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si @-@ board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seed and the possibility to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; he report@@ edly played a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , rights of farmers , control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would attempt to exploit the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance . &quot;
&quot; Klo@@ pp@@ enburg empha@@ sizes that the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; movement does not work with genetically modified crops . &quot;
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables , cor@@ n , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; food @-@ sovereign without seed levels is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative commit themselves to putting other seeds freely available to others . thus , its action in contrast to patent stands for seeds and plant features . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si @-@ supporters argue that the future of food supply is je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed , as the available genetic pool due to the becoming increasingly popular intellectual property rights in plant material , which is therefore always restricted , inc@@ ess@@ antly de@@ pl@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Claire Lu@@ by , Executive director of the Os@@ si , has engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that about a third of all cart@@ on characteristics is protected as intellectual property , making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult . &quot;
&quot; for other plants there are such estimates still not yet , but experts like Lu@@ by suspect that mass@@ acres are patented , like wheat in still larger style , than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants become so bred that they have targeted features - from such , through which their tastes or colour improves through to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for bre@@ eder is decreasing due to more and more patents . genetic diversity is currently less necessary than ever since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse predictable .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Monsanto @-@ Spe@@ aker in C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ tos . with a total of four commercial banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States , the company is set up for the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property must promote other bre@@ eder &quot; patents as &quot; patents and the protection of plant @-@ based innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired . &quot;
often these instructions are going to help others with another method to get the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but supports them by providing more material and know @-@ how to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton looks different : 20 years waiting for a patent , but certainly no innovation . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait for such a long time , to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions , they would have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources were always a general good , and they should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and mon@@ e@@ et@@ incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what motiv@@ ates us , and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in total , Mor@@ ton revol@@ ves at the concept of patent covering : &quot; we do not really create the features themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants are formed by themselves and as breeders , we ultimately have no idea of how plants do this . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for Carol de@@ pot , plant breeding @-@ in in the U.S. state of Oregon and Os@@ si pre @-@ board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; &quot; who mar@@ ching a variety , also raise its own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mon@@ ok@@ ul@@ tures , are needed for their cultivation of mass bi@@ bi@@ cides , who are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is very agre@@ eable . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Monsanto are ) patents , creating the most smaller seed companies , even without patents - either reject it or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bre@@ eder Frank Mor@@ ton is looking for in his breeding garden sal@@ ads .

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also the view that bre@@ eder by the A@@ void of plant pat@@ ors , &quot; it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than businesses . &quot;
&quot; I need a constant new material for my catalog , as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent one is 20 years before competition , with which I think it is very nice to do . &quot;
&quot; although the US appears to be a leading in the &quot; Open Source &quot; , &quot; the concept spreads rapidly around the world . &quot;
&quot; in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources , a &quot; open source &quot; seed programme ; the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties , which meet certain requirements . &quot;
&quot; it also supports them to come to &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seeds and sell their own . &quot;
&quot; the German organization Cat@@ col is working on an &quot; open source &quot; license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to bre@@ eder in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive powers of the European Union , the European Commission declared that conventional cultivated plants should not be pat@@ enting . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European patent pending patent , which permits patents in conventional cultivated plants . &quot;
&quot; an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is to the governments of the Member States , the patent pending patent to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , at the farmers , operators of seed commercial banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all Eastern Africa to learn something about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend for the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos;s program for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , that the organization is currently being a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which will be planned next year of the official start signal . &quot;
&quot; a merger from environmental protection and development groups ( including hi@@ v@@ os , the international non@@ profit @-@ development aid organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group to ero@@ sion , Technology and Con@@ centr@@ ation ) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others - published a report that farmers must have the opportunity to share in seed , to exchange and improve the seed policy to ensure stable supply of foods . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Lu@@ by from Os@@ si hopes to see him soon more people . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and organic food is mainly cultivated where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role , &quot; so Lu@@ by . &quot; we now try to clarify people that are even more behind their foods . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest objectives of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities block content on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; this time , it hit the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ nis@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the weekend around 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government has documented the website of the Norwegian Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above all @-@ mentioned above . &quot;
&quot; August , the network released an opinion on Facebook where the Egyptian authorities critici@@ zed sharply for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts of human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; to defend the target of the Network for Human Rights Information , despite this attack and the mo@@ ck of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities , who are actually defending the law , to overcome the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , even though it has never been so difficult to overcome the block@@ age and not im@@ itate it . we insist on pushing our task forward . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored site of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities sold more than two months of 21 pages , such as the independent news page MA@@ DA Mas@@ r , Arab @-@ language issue of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and that from Qatar , on Al Jazeera because of alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;

&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI there is also no access to the blog of Columbus and human rights research , Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada , no access to Egypt . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of colum@@ nis@@ ts and articles , which he has not posted publicly available websites and media in Egypt . &quot;
&quot; now the blog was directed to deal with the cens@@ ored apparatus of the Egyptian government , even the goal of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ g@@ gers , which is located in addition to Zi@@ adas blog , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity , after he was arrested in December 2013 by Egyptian security guards , while he resum@@ ed the students of Physi@@ cal violence against two students . &quot;
his articles are mainly related to politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada expressed himself to the blocking through the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; the blogs to lock is very old , however , has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ ally @-@ S@@ isi . and even if the block@@ age of the blog might not be significant for the world , so it is for two reasons for me : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) It has been able to give me the sense of a si@@ ege governing board ; An arrest , an tried murder , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , the lock@@ out blogs as well as any other web site , for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I wrote not in vain . in other words , my words have influence even if only on a small audience . &quot;
I want to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to the post of items to overcome the cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after having blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the Mu@@ ret go the way up to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Thou@@ ght and Ex@@ pression ( AF@@ TE ) , Egyptian authorities released from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . these erg@@ es technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provider ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ d@@ af@@ one and E@@ tis@@ al@@ at . &quot;
&quot; AF@@ TE also documented the block@@ age of vendors , which was possible through the handling of internet @-@ sur and Private surfing , so called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
AF@@ TE reported in its research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12th , we noticed how the block@@ age of websites , which V@@ P@@ N@@ s have started . &quot;
&quot; such practice indicates the intention of the government to continue to block content and filtering , on the Egyptian users access . &quot;
&quot; the situation is additionally ag@@ grav@@ ated that the cens@@ ored decisions behind closed doors are made , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis , with which she can proceed against this actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day newspapers report newspapers from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home of numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old in school was shot , &quot; &quot; Je@@ f the second day will be murdered by police officers in Rio de Janeiro , &quot; &quot; Die@@ th@@ ru@@ bs pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ ples sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Marine and Air Force to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation , the powers of violence reached in Rio have been the highest stand for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organization Global Justice announced even the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these are all daily and this is unacceptable &amp; # 82@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; published for the detailed reporting of violence in the Rio known newspaper &quot; &quot; Extra &quot; &quot; on 16 August 2010 , &quot; It is not normal &quot; in which it announced , a new section called &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now published there .
the motives for their decision explained the newspaper as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world such as murder , rob@@ bery , sex breaks , etc . all , however , apart from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio , is in the category &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
&quot; this is the only alternative , so that we as journalists do not close our eyes from cru@@ el@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video that was shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ edes , the Editor @-@ Chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure . &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper all over the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that doesn &apos;t recognize the war .
&quot; in the same video a journalist of the newspaper explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 territories that criminal organizations are controlled . &quot;
in the editorial company the newspaper writes on :
&quot; we are aware that a war dis@@ courses , if it is distorted , also to be used , atro@@ cities of the police , who only sho@@ ots and then ask questions to fail . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
did the term &quot; war &quot; more than they use@@ able ?
&quot; in an article on the message portal The Inter@@ cept Brasi@@ l , the journalist of Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argued the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; this is their opinion according to a justification of the written security policy through the media , and could make it difficult to hold responsibility for the police to account . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and bad planning - as has shown in the analysis of military deplo@@ y@@ ments in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ suffici@@ ency of the public service . &quot;
&quot; to remember : the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than just its capital . &quot;

Rio de Janeiro as &quot; the most violent place in Brazil &quot; is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 violent cities in Brazil is wrong according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date data .
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the murder rates per federal state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; extra belongs to the Glob@@ o company , the largest media company in South America , which empha@@ sizes such as Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia , has repeated the security policy of the state for years . &quot;
&quot; this security measures belonged to the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , one of the national state Rio in 2003 , whose objective is to conquer an Fav@@ ela and stationary a unit from there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . for some years , the U@@ PP but after several reports about ra@@ ils and re@@ pres@@ sions against the poor commun@@ es , which should actually protect the newly created police unit , increasingly under attack . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist JoÃ£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux from one of his articles from the year 2010 , in which he declares why violence in Rio is not established - established by the Geneva Convention - criteria for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war is also causing serious consequences for the human being . &quot;
&quot; for this calls the state to use means and ways which are typical for a war . this includes penetration into the territory of an &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civil war is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and for the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war or her , fact is that the inhabitants of the Fav@@ elas in Rio continue to suffer . &quot;
&quot; a week it is now that the police officers came up the mountain with the Fav@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ van@@ ho , in order to av@@ enge the death of a poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all of this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : an or@@ chard died as a result of shots that the police had escaped from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war many Syrian cities suffer from brutal attacks and block@@ ages , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victory Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization Pa@@ x and the Forschungs@@ institut The Syria Institute , are found in Damascus and Um@@ land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ lib currently around a million Syrians in a state of si@@ ege . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the East G@@ hou@@ ta region is especially affected where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for a hundred civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on the basis of investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre was practi@@ sed by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , those of rebels have been controlled by re@@ bel territories outside Damascus which led to the inhabitants of Ã¶r@@ ra@@ ined or supervised by tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the long @-@ term block@@ age , traditional foods such as meat become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a reference to a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics , the inhabitants of East G@@ hou@@ ta teaches how they can plant their own mushrooms as &quot; &quot; life @-@ saving food &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they call themselves G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ co@@ da , and perform the project together with the NGO al Ad@@ ala . &quot;
&quot; mushrooms do not belong to conventional foods in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , it makes them an attractive nutritional resource for many inhabitants of the besi@@ eged East G@@ hou@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the direc@@ ts of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we opted for cultivation of fungi , because they have high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for this project for three years , and ins@@ isted its relief that it gains now more and more &apos; awareness . &quot;
&quot; to collect money for the initiative , we use in consultation with the NGO G@@ hir@@ as Al@@ co@@ da the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families to provide knowledge of planting , such as Dr. Lei@@ la for Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the Constitution of this article , they reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12.@@ 700 , but will continue to receive donations from Can@@ Do until Monday , 04 . September 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C , and humidity at 80 % . &quot;
&quot; because of the fuel can be used locally , locally produced fuel from plastic to supply the generators using the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said global Vo@@ ices , that they began producing &quot; production &quot; from the region of fung@@ al fla@@ x@@ seed , before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
subsequently they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . as this succeeded they used a larger tub . and so on .
&quot; now they have designed a &quot; &quot; educational farm for the region &quot; . &quot; &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after a further 3 months they are distributed to mushrooms everywhere in East G@@ hou@@ ta .
Dr. Lei@@ la stated that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people the mushroom breeding of various reasons &quot; : breach of si@@ ege . &quot;
providing a new food source in the market .
&quot; dissemination of a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by eating knowledge ( like paper , tea , coffee , cart@@ on , cart@@ on , etc ) for extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creating new jobs , especially for women , working home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities that are tied to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and si@@ ege becomes visible .
we want our experience to be inspired by people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the fires of 2017
&quot; several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many district @-@ cat@@ er@@ pillars in Portugal and for justice for victims of fires , which were r@@ amp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the north of Portugal . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two people died , and about 70 were injured by the forest fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 dead persons .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 bur@@ sts breaks , spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached some 250 million acres of forest , and numerous villages . &quot;
in June there was a similar tragedy in Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured .
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , that monitors the forest @-@ areas by satellite images , alone , in Portugal alone , approximately 500,000 hectares of forest were burned - an area of the size of the district of Lisbon . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the gravity of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) 15 October , 2017 &quot;
some of Twitter users shared pictures :

numerous videos spread on the net and show images to make better insights into the action :
the fores@@ ee@@ able tragedy
the objective of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people asked why the civil protection was not able to conce@@ de the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
JoÃ£o Sover@@ al from the Bund der Landwirte of Portugal told the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; according to Pedr@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were ev@@ acu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
&quot; this Sunday they did this nowhere : there are d@@ utz@@ end@@ lessly reports of open roads , surrounded by fire . &quot;
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy could have happened as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , construction permits in furn@@ aces with high fire risk will be questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ sufficient proposal for the roll@@ out form , which had introduced the government after grave fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ections to the commun@@ es which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government led a loos@@ ening of the law that the applicant had the case permitted by the applicant , if the applicant had provided a means to self @-@ protection - that was an open back@@ door , so that everything could be built , &quot; JoÃ£o Sor@@ val takes on the same article in the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ cal@@ yp@@ tus trees , trees made of light burning wood , are like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; for these problems , the website of the civilian protection of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as inhabitants were sought or tried , to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative , which provided the population with information : they used the own civilian data data using the application fo@@ g@@ os@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the site and the spread of the fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was initiated by the developers JoÃ£o P@@ ina to simplify the work of fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the server followed the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who with@@ held the fires , did not with@@ stand the site more than half a million acc@@ esses . &quot;

in a night in autumn 1994 the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban .
&quot; two years ago , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ ed@@ in group@@ ings which had conquered the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan was turned into a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at this time , A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , who belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central af@@ gh@@ an@@ istan , for the last time with his family at supp@@ er . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not know it then , she knew that she would no longer see her son for a long time - maybe even more . &quot;
the dawn was to break the boy .
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring it to the tractor .

&quot; Ab@@ du@@ l Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the Assy@@ rians dominated by Haz@@ ara &apos;s Party , was just murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt vulnerable . &quot;
the Taliban created for their hate on the Haz@@ ara @-@ famous Taliban is getting closer .
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his flight , A@@ shar@@ per found himself in Pakistan . &quot;
he worked for a couple of years in a coal @-@ pit . the work was heavy and made him ill .
&quot; then he took what was left by his small salary , and went to Iran . once again he found himself in a foreign country with other refugees and s@@ lugg@@ ish s@@ acks with mor@@ tar , the he@@ avier than he himself , to make himself living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life af@@ gh@@ an refugees in Iran were characterised by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hang@@ ed n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we don &apos;t fres@@ hen up at night .
&quot; after four years A@@ shar@@ per left his life without papers in Iran , making it ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; on the dangerous passage across the sea , he suffered ships and stran@@ ts on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; once the Greek authorities had refused its asylum application , A@@ shar@@ k came to Italy . &quot;
&quot; some time was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks , and went to a church that divided twice a day of eating . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a kind of second chance for distr@@ acted asylum seekers . it is true , however , that the conditions to find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
&quot; the Civil Society Organisation for Europe writes , the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency . &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers will be accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; special reception centres . &quot; this is impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception center if they officially launched a request for asylum - which can be applied for months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then are people who don &apos;t have any money for accommodation , either instruc@@ ted to the hospitality of friends or must sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his in@@ stig@@ ma helped him to liber@@ ate herself from these conditions .
&quot; after having done various work in the construction industry for several years , A@@ shar@@ per had his entire savings in the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
&quot; this was so good , that after a while he opened a second hostel and a beak @-@ lim@@ p . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k Bar@@ atis success story is now subject to the documentation &quot; &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di . &quot;
&quot; the movie received the Venice City Award , which was presented for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Italians - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
for many of them the country is a transitional solution to other European countries .
&quot; in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ an companies created , including dres@@ sers , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some af@@ gh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the waiter and the staff are mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the restaurant &apos;s menu tells the story of her trip to Italy by the various af@@ gh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepren@@ eur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizzeria Kab@@ u@@ log@@ na in Bologna and a Sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ an .
&quot; A@@ shar@@ per &apos;s goals are far beyond Italian Ga@@ stronom@@ y and the retail trade and aim to go back to the country , which he had to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , are also opportunities , &quot; &quot; says A@@ to@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I never forget my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poorest provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and must get the same possibilities as everyone else .
&quot; together with plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , in which the people can learn packaging and consistency techniques . &quot; thus , they can sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepren@@ eur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ k has made this journey itself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; neo @-@ Report : legislative acts from Egypt allow off social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in jail . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearance of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ ac@@ ys Ne@@ ver @-@ Report is an international snapshot , the challenges , victories and emerging trends in global inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ ks , &quot;
&quot; the Egyptian parliament examines a legislative design , which pre@@ views that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after a registration at a government agency . &quot;
&quot; users must be able to use the social networks , within six months after the successful legislative decision on the website of the authority under specification of their full name as well as their reference number . &quot;
whoever failed this step could be sentenced to six months of imprisonment or the ex@@ tri@@ ght of a prison sentence .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty parliament@@ arians , lies currently the legislative and the constitutional Committee of the Parliament and should be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , a further referendum held a legislative proposal , which would be introduced into the tough@@ est pen@@ alties of the president or the high officials . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the cont@@ estation of the President as well as the state institutions is already pun@@ is@@ hable . however , under the law proposal , such a fact would be termin@@ ated with prison and cash tables , as right @-@ wing of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the distribution . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed the Egyptian police officers , who demonstrated violence against demonstr@@ ators who opposed the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan waited , like more than 700 Protest@@ ants , who were arrested in the same incident , four years in prison on a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postponed to 20 May , because the prison lines according to human rights groups failed to bring the accused of prison in the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threatens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree that the burden of inter @-@ arms , illegal gathering , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
in another case a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza held the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ ary . they were indicted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo .
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalists Abdullah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Must@@ afa and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previously mentioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisian activists are listening to sc@@ anned documents
&quot; in May , Tunisian authorities spent six hours with the inter@@ rog@@ ation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , who is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Adv@@ oc@@ acy project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has been handed over to a penetr@@ ated action plan . a bel@@ ated plan dates back to the President of the Republic , the business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of the corruption accused the officials of Am@@ nesty , provided that all non @-@ legitimate funds will be returned . &quot;
&quot; this document published on 21 April on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at &apos;s website , thro@@ ws a light on how the presidential plans to support the draft legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has refused to mention its sources under specification of Article 11 of the Tunisian press committee , which journalists ass@@ ures the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in Tunis at the district court in Tunis , on May 09 . May as a witness . &quot;
will China force the users of social media to submit their badge ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Office of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , users need to write social media in China before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is also stated that the registration will be required with the full real name . &quot;
analy@@ st suspect that this should be achieved by the elimination of anonymous comments in conversations within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities use these regulations .
Chinese power citizens are suggested in the social media to enforce these regulations only in order to protect bourgeois journalism and its independence .
then see you in &quot; We@@ chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !

&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or vers@@ ed We@@ chat , to register with the provincial government as the &quot; organizer of the information &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this name is part of a law from the year 2014 , thanks to which the Russian Government holds a list of online services which allows the &quot; publication of information &quot; . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for removing content and to force them on request for use of user data . &quot;
&quot; these web pages are currently sites such as V@@ contacts and Od@@ no@@ by@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service mail@@ .ru , and d@@ utz@@ er of other services . &quot;
Turkish Court has block@@ age Wikipe@@ di@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the block@@ age Wikipe@@ di@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators have refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the data that Turkey support the jihadists in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication has been blocked because they work for &quot; a source of information , which collabor@@ ates with groups to provide a political diff@@ usion campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has blocked the website completely . it is with that , besides among other China , one of the few countries worldwide , where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
UK can not stop making it mu@@ ff@@ les
&quot; after this week , the British government is located in the midst of targeted consultation on increased monitoring providers , the internet service providers , to monitor communications in real time and install back@@ door programs , encryp@@ t the data encryption . &quot;
&quot; however , the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services on the proposal , however , has expressed other technological enterprises and the civilian population from the outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation will still run until May 19 . responses and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
