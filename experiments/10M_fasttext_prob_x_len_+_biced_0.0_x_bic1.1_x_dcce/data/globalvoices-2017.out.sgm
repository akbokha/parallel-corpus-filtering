<seg id="1">Although I had visited the USA since 2012 at least once a year I would now live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extremely big.</seg>
<seg id="4">"as many of my generation I have grown up with American films, I have danced with American music, American authors and operated his sports."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had a profound impact on me, that I was mainly a journalist for an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The pelican letter, who covered with the help of Julia Roberts as Jura-Stued the murderous conspiracy of an oil magnates who wanted to be inclined to his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free after Method Man," "I was, as if that is absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year that I lived in Arizona, had only strengthened my admiration for the USA."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I said," "America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so welcoming you can always be that you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he goes with his narrow-minded.</seg>
<seg id="15">He never holds up with his opinion behind the mountain as you say so beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague put it, and explains publicly his contempt for Muslims, Latina, AfroAmerican and Women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in sheers for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes that he won in the Republican preselection, was the highest number one ever achieved by the party candidate."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigotilla person, I asked me?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not put Trump and his voters with the people that I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the journalist programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deep superstitious person, with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the mumps of worldview not coincide with the Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the" Cincinnati Inquirer. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"Bhatia and I met our mutual love for basketball and we spent many hours to watch the" Phoenix Suns "at the game."</seg>
<seg id="25">"mumps Infirmness is also in contrast to the generosity that I have experienced in Sandy Bahr, fighting for their lives long, and her husband Dave, my host family who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she is still adapting to the dedication of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace, and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Lecturkey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wiser council has helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the embodied in them embodied my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump received his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they offered me a grip and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 over 50 million Americans, mostly white, the presidency of a man, despite or perhaps because of its contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the debate with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared its racism and fanaticism, or because they were ready to miss these things, broke me almost the heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Maybe it is unfair to call the Trump-voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify the people, said one of my friends, is exactly what has led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">That is superficial and disrespectful and points an inability to understand those who act in a different way and think.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their worries and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not considered.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, of which are most white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that she disappointed?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they perhaps wanted to say that they are still important in America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commenting the cruel decision to elevate a man who look down with contempt to those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" "Whitelash" "(Cm.): much like" Entendence of the Whites against all other ethnics ";" words from white to the White and whiplash, which means as much as Schleudertrauma), as it was called the great Van Jones, exactly what America has done so great. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it's still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you might have, America is every welcome."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this land chose as his president, twice the son of a Kenyaners whose history, as he himself says, nowhere else in the world would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trumps, there is a huge part of the white Americas, and says: to Hell with Variety, Religious Freedom and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is back at the rod, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"for all this I have to think about Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fallen in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a word of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, had a place in your America?" I asked Mr. Khan. "</seg>
<seg id="49">"the crowd answered with a silently" "No!" ""</seg>
<seg id="50">"could Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" branded the quantity.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latina have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" "we replied."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they called them and their voices became louder.</seg>
<seg id="56">"could anyone who is not like you, a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a single-vote and voiced "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan made with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land, for which his son fell, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now trumps of land," said the message. "</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could no longer find place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the paraguan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music that is played in both places, not only the life of the children, but also a very close link with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large garbage dump; only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city which is very popular among tourists but worlds from the nearby prehistoric ruins and its world-famous kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La Banda de MÃºsica (MusikBande) has been playing in the community: one from children and adults with an existing symphony orchestra, which has found a possibility to overcome them with their music-instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become the central interest in the municipality of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drugs abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and the youth had such a rare hope of hope."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young bandmembers take their commitments to the music group very seriously, means the local press notcias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"once they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to go to their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come up with gleaming eyes and play in the Trubel you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, Oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Paugos and the Conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are playing the children of Cateura - a village, which is practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of AsunciÃ³n in Paraguay's capital - on instruments produced from recovered waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with recovered instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where recycled - under the direction of Favio ChÃ¡vez began to turn parts of the waste."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violating, viola, celli, double basses, guitars, flute, trumpets, trombones, trombones and percussion, all produced out of the trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire comprises classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of The Beatles, from Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez remembers a local enologist and musician instructor for the children of Cateura, at the beginning of the time:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash The children did not know music and it was very difficult to contact parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">That changed as Favio something was shown what he had never seen before: one of waste performed violin.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra which plays material from recovered material and which the recycled Orchestra is called."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) draws the musical performance to:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world produces about one billion tons of trash each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">Those who live with him and from him are the poorest people - like the people in Cateura. Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with his inspirational spectacle from trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These eastern African countries show how technology and team work can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo Â© FISH-i Africa - a project that fought wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reported on international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">Re-publication happens within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, at that time, it was known that this ship had already hosted illegal fishing water before it was looking for the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">"the eastern African countries were accordingly dark, and is little inclined to welcome a legislative fringe of this kind at their coasts."</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comoros, Mozambique and the Seychelles mobilised themselves quickly against the ship. they refused to baptize one of their harbours and refused to place him an old fishing trip."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" Ursuddenly was the prime minister surrounded by countries that you just refused, "" Benedict Kiilu, a leader of the Kenyan fisherman's office. he is part of a team who discovered the ship at the time and followed. "</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also compelled to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to plundering of fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"at the heart of this initiative, the criminal practices crossed and resources protection was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NRO Stop illegal Fishing (Illegal fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">The members of this network are adjacent to Somalia and Madagascar the six countries which then had driven the Premier from their waters.</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this, we have eight countries who are like minded and working together. they exchange information and stand each other where there is illegal fishing," says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trust project Ending illegal Fishing. this project has FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught, is hidden because of it's extremely difficult to divide. therefore, illegal fishing is a leading cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by intentional disrespect of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing ecosystem can harm, which have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"while actions against illegal fishing were once handicapped by bureaucratic hurdles, and also through the snow-empo, with the information between individual countries, so the actions occurred today in real time, with trackable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there, the individual countries can interact with each other for example lists of existing licenses, news on suspected activities or details that you noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i pursues the activities of ships also very attentive, if they are moving across the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to identify ships that fish in botany areas. also allow such suspicious routes to discover, such that a ship invites its fish onto other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations may show whether the participating ships have a fishing licence where they were on the way and possibly, whether they have a criminal record."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries who are against illegal fishing may refuse the acceptance of such ships in their ports, which means that the ships could not sell their cargo. and that they may even be forced to be forced by penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is then a significant financial loss for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is not worth more financially."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, leader Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consultant company that advocates the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">The already mentioned platform was created to gain estimated 20 million USD in lost turnover that the eight members of the Network HISH-i lose each year due to illegal fisherman who penetrate into East African waters.</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fishing plants that attracts the region commercial fishing from all over the world. among these also those illicit fishermen.</seg>
<seg id="122">"such activities include actions like sailing under false flag, counterfeit licence papers, indication of fantasies, the fish protected species and the fish in nature reserve."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they utilise the missing international co-operation and make up the weaknesses of a not incomplete control system, "says Long." "previously, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say" you dared to walk my port. "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say" Come to me '. "" and precisely this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="125">So far the closed front works.</seg>
<seg id="126">Since its foundation FISH-i was involved in more than 30 investigations into suspects.</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has been exposed criminal networks to spread counterfeit licenses in Tanzania. it discovered vessels that used several fraudulent identities, and it has tracked ships and found it."</seg>
<seg id="128">"based on his collaboration with INTERPOL, the international authority for fighting crime, FISH-i information can share information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our studies lead us quite far into the networks organised crime, "said Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system, which is supposed to help FISH-i to lay down ships accurately."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is always developed further, also helps to trace the illegal ships that are happy to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishing use very refined techniques to hide their activities and their position, "says Duncan Copeland, boss analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO that also deals with fishing data and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships also turn their automatic identification systems, so that they can no longer be Georgian."</seg>
<seg id="135">"Copeland helps to build a system, which combines different information levels. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team African nations can actually influence the undoubtedly global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has recently opened the Global Fishing Watch platform: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed in the world by means of the position of each protraceable ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" join together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who knows where - that is simply meaning, "" he says. "" here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources for the investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run, in which a global system permits the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities can not only feel criminals, but they also deterred."</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships who had formerly overexploited and hardly expected with consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have now submitted a 33% increase in fishery sales, since fisherman boats more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to record Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board tuppets whose use is forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo with friendly permission of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice this success." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "in West Africa, several hundred million dollars vanish each year by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"in 2015 six countries have joined together, the so-called West Africa Task Force. also, they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "with certainty the aim of making even more such initiatives and structures emerge in other regions," says Copeland. "</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's youngest member country would announce his first big triumph: in October there was Greko 1, a ship which was under wrong flag. and not just the ship was also used without a license and were towing machine used by now."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also penetrated in the bottled waters which are reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with taking action against Greko 1 set a strong signal that they go against illegal fishing", "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time proof that such a special, collaborative way to protect the oceans actually works in the entire world sea. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to transition, one requires two important abilities: passive language skills to understand the starting text and to active language skills to transfer him to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active mastery of the target language - something that is the case in maternity language. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language - are not in the primary language - native speaker."</seg>
<seg id="379">So a French native language should translate from English into French - not from French to English.</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese firms do not employ workers with English as a native language to produce the translations into English. this may be misunderstood to understand the reasons, reasons or the relatively small number of English speakers, the Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who even have no foreign employees, do not allow translations to make company-internal. then the Japanese staff, whose English skills are trained as the best to be trained as the best possible to become translators - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr users Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widespread - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the contaminated and enigmatic assemblies that are created by machine translation, show that this technology will not yet be replaced by human translators for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strange English formulations in Japan, including the puzzling prints, which often used T-shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>

<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless at least. but, by large companies or by the government that have the means to ensure higher standards, you can be careful translations."</seg>

<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian elections recently voted "draft" to the regulations regarding the use and usability of social networks.</seg>
<seg id="503">"when he is adopted by the Parliament, beneficiaries, and users of social media have to register in Egypt at a government agency to use social media, including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established in order to give citizens a permit to place social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of adopting the law, beneficiaries and users must register on the site of the site with their correct name and human resource numbers to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"will it miss this to do so, this could be a penalty of up to six months in jail or a money-buck."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill introduced which consists of six pardonors and in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defined social media as" any application that runs through the internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video calls and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when the design cannot be assumed, as Egyptian authorities work on the registration process. it is uncertain how the Egyptian government is not able to sign up for the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, MPs and sponsors of the legislative situation, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users and users received a username and password to get through the firewall, the Facebook blocks."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to set a firewall on national level all around Facebook. because of which, it would be necessary for the Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not yet known that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts from the site are sceptical regarding the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" leading research-related drugs ") the Egyptian initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "),"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt strongly about the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they did so forcibly physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"when I take it seriously, then it means that they will set up a strong surveillance system to request citizens who request a permit or not. and this means a crazy system to monitor the activities of the people and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"" "to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislature of parliament and constitutional committees, before it enters into the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement is successful or not, the design is consistent with a pro-military thinking of the parliament, in whose sense the control is maximised and safeguarded that no aberration of scar on the image is present," says Raoof. "</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the MPs called Tamer El-Shahawy established a legislative situation against cyber crime in which a life-long prison sentence for those was destined to threaten the" public order "and" to protest. ""</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo documented the progress made in the last six years in order to re-rebuild the lives of those who had been hit by the" triple catastrophe "of March 2011. a major earthquake, a Tsunami and a nuclear accident in Fukushima had triggered a disaster."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is in Miyagi Prefecture, the Prefecture of Miyagi was a etinprefecture in Japan's northeast who had both experience the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">"hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring-notations of Fukushima and Iwate were forced to depart from the country of the tsunami, because the tsunami had a whole coastal cities disappear from the map."</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, the Fukushima prefecture experienced a nuclear accident - already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their houses."</seg>
<seg id="548">The special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from a local point of view which advances the progress six years afterwards to rebuild the life of the local residents.</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper includes both statistics of the Japanese reconstruction authority as well as survey results of those affected themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"housing construction at Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reported that by December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned spare houses (in the context of this event, soigai kouei juutaku) were completed in the prefecture of Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate."</seg>
<seg id="552">"the biggest success among the three prefectures could see Miyagi, here 80 percent of the planned spare parts were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of these houses, whereas Fukushima has 70 percent of the final light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, one is still trying to resettled six years after the disaster, evacuated from Behelfsacelle (in the context of the" "Kazaksu Jugoaku)" "into final subhouses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 there were still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of 2011 evacuated from Fukushima still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi has been more successful. more than 75 percent of the evacuated shelters, which were taken after the disaster in the homes of accommodation, were settled in final houses."</seg>
<seg id="558">For Iwate the number is here at 34 per cent.</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of works and daily life in the three affected cases.</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to determine 1074 of 1100 schools, which were affected by evil, their doors to December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">"six years later, industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures are far more difficult."</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishery in Iwate and Miyagi have been in operation again, at Fukushima only 30 percent of the fishery were re-recorded their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, have raised in the three prefectures of agricultural land in co-passionately."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to recover 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent of the agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares destroyed arable lands of Fukushima, are located in the" "nuclear barrier zone". ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefect of the prefectures, tourism has recovered further again, but also here Fukushima still remains unstable."</seg>
<seg id="567">The tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are back to 90 percent at the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima still can only have 75 percent here.</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reported that since the disaster nearly half of the coast-inhabitants, it became more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population being prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"to be able to determine an overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the native population and among the evacuated ones. she asked her about the status of reconstruction and also how their rebellion have changed over the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">In the introduction of the article the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper explains:</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo introduced a survey to bring more about the tsunami consciousness among the local people in experience.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey conducted that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures taken to be prepared to be prepared for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in the catastrophate prevention was done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had evacuated from Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">In its edition about the anniversary of the earthquake the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also reinforced its attention on the position of the evacuated from Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima still had to experience the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, the prefecture of Fukushima was also a witness of the worst, disaster relief, atoman accident that had ever had to experience in Japan."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuated from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were reported in areas outside of the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"in early 2016, some more than 23 000 people have been converted back to Fukushima, in permanent spare parts."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the state of 2017, more than 40 000 inhabitants of Fukushima still live from their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in disaster situations like most of the evacuation areas, most of the evacuation shelters are older than 50 years old. they do not have to compete with massive construction projects. this is the construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games, which will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="1187">The book that was published last year and is available here licence-free contains a number of approaches that deal with the free culture in the countenance of oppression.</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book wishes to discuss how movements are set up for free knowledge, and what the real costs are associated with which this is connected."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movements for free knowledge, have been working side to the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteers, who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was repainted from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on 3 October 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book with the title of collective remembrance gives his friends and family, who want to push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, has many of us start to think about their own destinates, deeds and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we now here?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of time-wise convictions?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The webDeveloper for Open Source and digital activist has been in the detention of Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015 Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military institution to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer of Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel reported on the basis of a "" secret "" command of the military base from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons on 12 November 2015, advocated themselves as insider of the Assad government and took note of a alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his place of residence and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role to expand access to Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, Technologist and at the moment overriding the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on the pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"perhaps none of Bassels cultural prototypes was foreseeable than the work, which he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archeological sites of the world, was the cross-crossing of many civilizations and here merge Greek-Roman architecture types with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything about it, this architecture that not only embodies the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this strike into the digital archeology and conservation has created a time clause, which will be invaluable to the public and for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">Ironically this project has not yet been completed so far.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband, to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my whole life with this, dream of freedom to dream, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">Bassel gave me English at even when he was already in custody.</seg>
<seg id="1216">I learned to read and speak English well.</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with each one who has asked. he taught other detainees to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel has opened me the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computer and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners of how they use computers, at least theoretically, without fact that they actually had one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), an instant smell, which she wrote in the years 2012 until 2015, when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura worked together in the book for a year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she gripped the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he transferred them from the Arabic to English."</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambians reacted with anger on a corrupt situation, in which a government member returned to the workplace in the state apparatus, where the corruption has been committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is the Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in 2010 with four other defendants (about 800 000 Euro) to 22 years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of the Mozambique airport, whose Council of Cambaza set between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 due to good guidance and immediately called for its reinstatement in the company, which happened on 19 April as well."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with an opinion of the General State-General Prosecutor of the Republic, which claims the application, there would be no obstacle for Cambaza to re-assert his old post, since the company was not completing a disciplinarity after his custody."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many citizens called the action not well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public integrity (Centro de Integrated de PÃºblica, briefly CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, was condemned in an interview with Deutsche Welle the decision of the company to reconfigure the director:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a back-back in the fight against corruption and clarifies the lack of transparency and is even a regress with regard to the efforts of our legal system, the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we take note is that the company should have a disciplinarity against the withheld objections.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently slog up and does not set any reasonable legal steps to apply the respective functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"EgÃ­dio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambian social media, rejects this behavior also and considers the case as" blackness ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and to eat half of them."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold talks and motivating speeches, he could consult and polishing his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be integrated into the company, which he helped to cause harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Thus it is obvious: Cambaza is going to be paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Contradictory!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mosambian and student of political sciences in Brazil, the director had no morality:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state, because he was invigorated I can not believe that someone was rewarded by the state that the state has already been so massive."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks the morality to return and serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served themselves on the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as a handler to an inexhaustible money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who recharged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey ZeÃºte preferred to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel to remember that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora Machel, the Mozambians will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp one-cutting, and - next door with said - prophetic speakers."</seg>

<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar PAE" means Kicherherse or Spage.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network received its postings from the net because they included the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people with East-Indian origin, or generally used as an adjective" inous. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "doing this" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">In recent years the rise of radical nationalistic movements the Word has given an extremely radical connotation.</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is commonly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, which represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on his platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar's may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself is not automatically called hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also Posts in which they have discussed the use of the word or have doubts, for his use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"furthermore, there are several burmessic words with the different meanings that have the same letter as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmisch also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as also other words like 'Kalar PAE' (Spage psis), 'Kalar oat' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooky Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail of one of my friends was erased today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in spiritual manner, whether she knew how he could alleviate his back pain by playing a word game."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the set ku la -" "cure" "(ku) + the Frack word (la) at Burmisch - resembles the racist expression very, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that the hate speech will diminish more radical nationalists, stressing that Facebook must be analytical before it all postings to spread the suspicion that racism has been suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook deletes the word "Kalar" not manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism is not understood what you write to Facbeook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and control it by checking the following words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example, Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar PAE" (Spage-age). "</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good is that these three-earth nationalists will spread the hate speech, a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">"now, it is time to be circumcised by its nationalism."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who may distribute hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not stop long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experience of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and Wechat have proven that the censorship of keywords are often a catchy and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are just starting to use a new word or alternative spelling of the Word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his postings, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished off the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I was attentive to this new directive from Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the Word is closed."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post-mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited to delete posts and parts of content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community standards did not talk". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has a variety of posts that have no negative purposes or simply trying to show their opinions against hate speech more radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion about why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have more to do before the beginning of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet Community to ask for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">Facebook may have a well-performing intention to reduce racism in Burma by their platform but it does not work.</seg>
<seg id="1323">To censor such words will only bring more hatred inside the various communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">It seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and so words like "chair" or "inheritance curry" have forbidden.</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they have found that they have made mistakes, they did not attempt to report the falsily dissolved posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that were complaining for them, would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebooks provide automatic censorship for a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make funny and write aware of the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech, in order to see if their postings are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots from Facebook-Posts, which included no hate speech, but still removed:"</seg>

<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to criticise the endurance-hate speech on his Burmese pages under control.</seg>

<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">For over a month Turkey has now blocked the popular and on the crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day by day becomes more evident, as important the platform for users is to find helpful and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV-series are fighting against the blocking.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many technologic Internet users are used to use reversing tools for block web pages (an current article of the New York Times reported that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence of the world), most of the usual Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been posted article by Wikipedia, as recently published in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, has been taking place regular blockages of the Internet since 2007, after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"in China, Turkey is the second most famous country in the world when it comes to massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to remain closed, there are now several mirrorsites (pages that reflect the contents of Wikipedia and often be updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary file system), used as the platform for all Turkish Wikipedia sites on its decentralised Peer-to-peer network (computer calculator) which does not base itself on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete zencensorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">The content is available in spite of legal banning.</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blogpost IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after we have heard the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put everything from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility of reading the content on decentralized and distributed mode."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least see any Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach www.wikipea.org web site."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also assumed that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is only about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to handle the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has had a spill side of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrorsites if in the respective country is blocked."</seg>

<seg id="1410">"you can access a different URL, which is not the original. that which one can then see is from Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh give women to respect that they should respect the husband due to social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences they should equip this practice in life."</seg>

<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs, which exists in 13 Indian states, it is part of the campaign # KhelBadal that is operated by the community Video Volunteers, and committed to the reduction of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera on the coverage of practices, such as children's marriage, up to the exile of HIV- and AIDS infected persons, and guides these clubs."</seg>
<seg id="1480">They reported how these clubs made a safe place for these women and at the same time have made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video, the Rohini was shown in its discussion, acted by women who did not name their male spouses."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this issue because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem that the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"to pronounce the name of their husbands, is a bread which she is maintained and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini writes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testified that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"a woman who does not conceal this, is seen as a backrest, as a woman without morality."</seg>
<seg id="1487">The tradition is so deeply rooted that we never have thought to that discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name for her husband, to try out at home as it runs."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini talks:</seg>
<seg id="1491">"my mother-in-in-law and my husband stayed for a long time, after the video was finished."</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Practise, my husband, turned to me and said, I should name him from now on in his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in his luggage the Rohini started its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" Patriarchate "before. some felt it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">After the video projection the women tried to put the discussion with a exercise.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, upset, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then asked them all," If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want it, does that they do not respect us? "</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day when they brought the name of their husbands over the lips," says Rohini Pawas in Maharashtra over the Brechen of a centuries-old tradition, in which married women could never say the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini talks:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she had hired only before the whole exercise, and another decided to let him out all the vaute frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in addition to the adrenalin rush over, having broken with an old bread, the women decided that they were actually trying to call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">In the next few days Rohini received a variety of reports.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"the husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas they put into the head: his wife could not cease to say its name."</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member chose to do it at dinner in front of the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law she gazing, she was afraid and said that there was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," Rohini said it. "</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant in was less understanding and the situation rests in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the galvanic red spot on the forehead, showing the Ehestatus:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would carry the cinored spot if he too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed only and I listened to him to wear him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not fully ceased, but mine, they are now in a better position to choose themselves, to do it in some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">For many women the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals.</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we are doing a trip at every panel."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want the women to worry who what could hear," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things that they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have been talking about some things, such as our identities on our husbands, have never been so honest."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to say certain things loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">In a panel we talked about the concept of honor and how it is connected to clothing.</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only worn scoffin since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most is the okay, but some wanted a salem spa, a broad shirt over a pants, wear; they did not do it."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much argument and discussion about the advantages of their own clothes-choice, morals joined with the Saris and much more, ornaments Rohini her own pair of Kurd (Oberinhiden) into a panel discussion, so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans, and Rohini is sure they will be able to do it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"the question whether things have changed in the five months since their first discussion club, Rohini, that things slowly enter into the roles:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">We have only made small steps so far.</seg>
<seg id="1533">Some women tried it a few times but then they listened again to say the name of their husanne.</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, included me, do it still, but only if they are alone and are not other family members."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women are now wearing Zinnoberred on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes that they want to achieve in their lives - like the crawling for more freedom of movement or the own clothes-choice - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a sacrifice of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am there too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it's not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home and other people told what we talk about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We all sit in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that will not be reported.</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question might seem stupid as Singapore is recognized as an independent state as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, Shanmugam should be considered as a city in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the Bar Association of New York, the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the only political party of Singapore because it was compared to Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supportive that Singapore was to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">No-one has questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice," turning its logic to defend the existing authoritarian practice of power in Singapore. "</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrificed to create this valuable country, we hear that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the semblance of escape from the responsibilities, a mandatory infringement."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons made by Shanmugam were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it he seemed undisturbed."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"however, he defended the idea that Singapore with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York should be compared, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the issue, the good old lyre of the authoritarian rulers appear to be the prevailing logic, as they fit better into their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the final week, the last week of Shanmugam gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">Related questions will be related to non-answers of rational kind.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng is calling for Shanmugam to tell his opinion, because she didn't understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally think it's a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"in Singapore no country, but a city is, thus to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I understand nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our appreciative K Shanmugam would take the effort to clear that point, if he was paid highly, to be part of the government of the city of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by announcing his comment on the blog, he notes regarding the reviews that one should begin to read the entire transcription of the conference, so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore was a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"he said that Singapore was more like a" city "than a country," he said why the elections in Singapore are as insignificant, even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He held Singapore with cities in the United States (and how many of these cities were winning a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"he said, Singapore" "is not a country," "he obviously does not mean it in that sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is a leader in a growing generation, such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am talking about what the Minister of Justice in Singapore said, very..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expect - would I agree with them or not, but that is another matter."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of political leaders from Singapore, I have doubts and I'm not even sure if he really believes it is really associated and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The Temasek review sets the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "believed a mistake", "or was it a boldscher speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are regarded only as independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, which country would go back the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is equally land and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since it plays an important role within the government of the cabinet, the statements made by Mr Shanmugam are of severe importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the hunters have their military service, they only defend their city but not their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay our Prime Minister bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink payroll?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"tends to Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore and always was a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">"I have not told what I said..."</seg>
<seg id="1730">This set seems to have annoyed many of its strength...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever told that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements such as" "defense of the country above all", "but that is not entirely correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the city's defense.</seg>

<seg id="1771">"being harmless, means inconspicuous and uninteresting and no attention to earn."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"across the way of migrants, across Europe or Latin America, certain places for their hospitality are known."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, he is on the border of Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is headed by a 59- yearold Mexicanine, a small woman with a coral-pink brilliance and gold-coloured earrings in teddy bears form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called ConcepciÃ³n GonzÃ¡lez RamÃ­rez, and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name of Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2,50 dollars the night sleep the guests in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrots in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. RamÃ­rez, the people are told in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they begin to call:" mom "Africa!"</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mommy Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at present it is rather quiet, but this year RamÃ­rez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also already slept on cardboard boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">You do not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital if they are sick, they buy them medicines that they cannot pay, they massaging them with a balsam, from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived a short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if mom is a reasonable nickname for Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>

<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," "he answers with a smile." I really feel that it suits her as African women are very nice women. "</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">"Sebastien travels with his sister, who hopes to get to Boston where she can find her husband and the three children."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to normally take a first stop in South America and then move towards north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companion of Mama Africa." Mama Africa is a famous name on the track, "" Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti. "</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that the Haitians and Africans often travel the track together and that the Africans were already speaking on Whatsapp from Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companion, Michelet has lived in Brazil beforehand and worked as construction workers on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the football world championship."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy has weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">"for months he has been a guest at Mama Africa: he sells SIM cards to save the required money, to buy the ticket ticket to Tiber."</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he is in the future with Mrs. RamÃ­rez.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave them again," he answers smiling. "we will always keep in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Mrs. RamÃ­rez tells her guests her often to send text messages when they continued to greet them or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">They explained that their Christian faith is the drive of their work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she does not know much about Africa, but their guests have brought her to prepare chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">Mrs. RamÃ­rez is perhaps very well known here but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula.</seg>
<seg id="1936">"on the other end of the city, there is a dead end to JesÃºs Valenzuela."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants would be sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has started to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"for the moment 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the ground, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," "he tells." I have experienced what they experience. "</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border crossing the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's the reason why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived there for three years, he was transferred to a raid on his work place from the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travels through Tapachula, comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their houses for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">JosÃ© Antonio Cordova MelÃ©ndez tells me that he was flown in Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to press money from him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula it is in demand of an accommodation and an unknown, one single-setting, has offered him its roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family lives still there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back to the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">In the courses the travelers consult with their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1953">A minibus arrived today and has brought 20 new guests to most of Somalia.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. RamÃ­rez seems happy that her house is full, but it is also nostalgically, because of those who have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud Grandmother she blows her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair ties that made her a customer satisfaction, some photos of her grand children and many travellers more, boy and Old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">They laugh so saddened while she prefers me briefly.</seg>

<seg id="2061">I can really no longer say when insults and blows become a friendly conversation for me to become an ordinary means of communication.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how this happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"any voice in me said that I had to get used to it or to get used to it, although I had done nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">On punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">Its command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls this lovingly "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic pipe which probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your Henker rejoiced at your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure you with him, and you cannot reshold your screams."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry did not fall in him, so why she exchanged the pipe by a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"when I first asked me, I asked if the investigator had worked as a trash collection or if it belonged to the normal working equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they had twined four cables intertwined in order to present us the, from their perspective, great invention of a huge cabal."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them usually came from while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feelings in my body - and my voice, which is why I listened to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noted the cooling and found no favour at all, which is why he finally reached an electric uploaded wheel."</seg>
<seg id="2076">Electricity flowed my entire body enough to supply my entire neighborhood.</seg>
<seg id="2077">"my semi-nude body, which lay down on the floor, was the perfect electricity leader."</seg>
<seg id="2078">The numbness disappeared and the pain was back again.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for this night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">This must probably have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">I decided to sleep again again; let's say that was my only option.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"some hours passed, which happened to me as minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room" .Rout with you, Arschficker. "</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answered with the voice of an exhaustive youth:" "my Lord, my father has to be fearful." ""</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and walk you, you will be transferred."</seg>

<seg id="2090">"the jordani Rapper Emsallam Hdaib talks about the rights of the LGBTQ + community, free expression and resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2091">Emsallam Hdaib smokes a cigarette in his studio.</seg>
<seg id="2092">"the photo was taken from Aman Madan, the original author of this text."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"Emsallam Hdaib spend most of his time indoors; sometimes he mute to his canvas, to his computer, and again also to his couch."</seg>
<seg id="2094">But what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or its carotene lips.</seg>
<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house which had belonged to them since 1967; the year, in which Israel accomplished his occupation of the West Bank, and Hdaibs family forced themselves to flee from their village in Palestine in which they lived as felahedron (about: Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"Hdaib has been a passionate activist who faces the conservative majority and questioned their proven opinions on gender roles, sexuality and free expression through art and rapmusic."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, but he also calls for the core of the entire Arab world. all these topics are not only found in his native Amman relevance, but also in cities that go from Damascus in Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his mind, and he can have compassion with the people who suffer under the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not give it openly, he gets against the American foreign policy a special inclination."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib looks at his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib doesn't believe his compassion for those who are trying to survive in war-areas to do anything with his identity as" Palestinian refugees "- so he himself, even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think of my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think that because I am a man, while he is poured into two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims, from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"moreover, the law law also states that the public intake of food during Ramadan are illegal."</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously Hdaib has a certain weakness to break with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee in a sensing hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">Basically the sleds of hot coffee and the swaths of the cat cigarette in the nose first line of freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2108">"at times, Jordan feels like a prison in the open sky, especially when you take a look into the neighboring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it simply avoids basic things to do - as to drink in public during Ramadan water - in order not to land in jail."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry of Jordaniens made an appearance of the band Mashrou'Leila already, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentary members who support the Islamic Programme of Action - the jordan branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual fronts of Hamed Sinno, contradicted the cultural and traditional standards of the country and the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the S & D spokesperson in the Islamic coalition DIMA Tahboub said in an interview with CNN, that the concert was said" just "because of the sexual orientation of the Skaners."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many believe that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is more dangerous activism that questioned the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes throughout the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement Mashrou'Leila the" "progressive supporter of human rights", "which continued to stand for an intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement may probably not be easy to track rhetoric, but indeed a more evident reality in Jordan, which appears to be clearly visible in Hdaibs."</seg>
<seg id="2116">In 2016 Hdaib traditional gender standards too glue by playing his vision of the fate of Arabian women who have pre-marital sex.</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the image shows the skeleton of a clearly low-established woman, whose arms and legs up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those who actually trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">In the past years Jordan has increased the number of 'Honorary morde' - the unofficial outside.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of Honorary morde in 2016 reached its peak; however, Jordan was still missing that Jordan has no institutional infrastructure to support the victims of murder or domestic violence, in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on fighting fight against the year 1954, women who are subjected to risk of domestic violence, and for their release is often a years of bureaucratic effort as well as the guarantee by the family need nothing to happen."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is well-known for this, too, not to shy back on issues that lived in his country for a long time as tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, however, that he is his music, the full explicit assesses of sexuality, freedom and expression, cannot be separated from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was drawn into politics", "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2126">In a song called "Edward Sa'ed" Hdaib takes on the question of Palestinian identity.</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lavla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the list of songs that are politically political, can be continued."</seg>
<seg id="2129">In March 2016 Hdaib released a song entitled "Santandano."</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and any other it is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song, Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one can get in his words" that can be what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterosexuality or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he notices that hardly anyone talks in Jordan about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + -individuals will still be censored up in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014 Hdaib led an interview for the popular jordan Onlineprogram Roya, to later realize that his comments from the context were torn down, and his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but was only a revised version," says he. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib acquires open to the arabic TQ + community and represents the opinion that intolerance towards homosexuals don't speak to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who still has remained in mind thanks to its homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks: if Abu Nuwhat, who later should work on behalf of the potassium, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why does Jordanier do not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was canceled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the Hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Lebanese news service took several former government members and members of the educational association, with the reason they expressed themselves on comments in social media critical to the problems linked to deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the concert Hdaib's opinion is said only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to effect a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanier."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress has been a continuous giving and taking. Jordan has made a performance to Mashrou'Leila for the second time, but it looks like Hdaib - consists of slow, depressing and internal changes. he is certain that these changes will take place from day to day in the heart of the Peruvian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"finally, Hdaib dreams about how millions of other Arabs also, from a Arab world without interventions from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he dreamed not only to bring his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus but also to experience them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region is going through music, art and literature of a genuine and fundamental openness - and not by bombs, streams and artificial kind of guided democracies. at least he hopes that."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"so far, Hdaib will continue and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is believed that there is a variant of Tanabata festival, which is usually recorded in August in many areas of Tohocus. another theory asserts that the strongholds, the drum, and the tances come over more than a thousand years ago and marched from a period in the armies from the West of Japan to the northeast, to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi, to the knees."</seg>

<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the working version of the paper" "love bothers" "on guerrilla warfare," which has released the international online magazine Tea After Twelve. "</seg>
<seg id="2182">This article is published here within a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love notes to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not yet much more important, people who have evolved to offer affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">This question was about the two young Colombian activists by the Stiftung Bogota and Cristian Palacios by the Young-Youth-Foundation not more from the head and inspirational her to the campaign Cartas por la RejliaciÃ³n (letters to reconciliation) who urged young people to write letters.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently her country was swaying a historical event and they wanted to contribute their part of it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary forces in Colombia), which forms the junction point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">International was considered to be the sign of the peace treaty as significant that the Colombian president JosÃ© Manuel Santos received for his services to the Nobel Peace Prize.</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, prior to the Colombian, there is still a long way to talk about real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla warfare, who lived for many years in illegal bearings, were exposed to war rhetoric and carried out around the clock their weapons, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"Colombian society in turn, in turn to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla warfare, must take in its ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young columbians must join together and would have to help with the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's what they did: up to now thousands of young people have written letters - love hands on former guerrilla warfare to welcome them back in society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla war - which should then be given personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">The Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the letters to reconciliation was created on the world summit of the Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in BogotÃ¡ in February 2017. there's Leonardo and Cristian the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi in which 2014 was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we love the people who love, Valentine's Day, write thousands of love letters, but those forget that they need much needed."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plane, he told further to share his love with people this year, which needed the most urgent."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"thus, the plan, letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now find their place in society and to establish a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse from a war story to a common history of peace."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters were collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia such as Cali, Manizales, MedellÃ­n, Barranquilla and BogotÃ¡."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"I had never thought that someone would forgive me"</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to the region of Caldono-Cauca on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students of the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the city administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Foundation Bogota have been moved to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">Members of FARC presented themselves as they had done before to face the commands of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no precepts, but the letters full of people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it is incredible how many different feelings you can go through in just a couple of hours - from fear to happiness and everything that lies in between, "" told the policy science-student Manuela JimÃ©nez Avila later. "</seg>
<seg id="2207">Sandra Parra, an assistant of the Governors of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so: "</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after we had passed the letters, a former fighter led me to the camp of guerrillas fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambuches "(a kind of hut, in which the guerrilla warfare) saw, I saw a guerilla which wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed a MGL-pomeaves, a deadly weapon in the bush-shreddish."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"nevertheless I said to him and asked," "Hello, what are they doing right?" "he answered," I answered a letter, which someone wrote me. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never in my life has written someone something so nice, so I answered. I suddenly got the tears over the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranary.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was not the war, I was sorry to be all the years of loyal companion of this fighters, and he wanted to help him to write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he never had anything else expected of life than war. he had never imagined anything from life as war. himself, the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before hunger." "I had never thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there that is awaiting us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have only learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"to the start-up, students and some leaders of the FARC came to a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all raised up as a war, and the FARC already acted in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leader of the FARC, the history of the organization, their ideals, and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years now, we have experienced how the social injustice through the state has resulted in the entire Colombian people. now, where we have the opportunity to develop ourselves to a political party, we can contribute to shaping the society in this country. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this order, it is worth to overcome all obstacles," said one of them. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"listening to these people who had never heard heard before and had no voting right, and to realize that the people I often saw as Monster and even hate even humans with beautiful feelings, which were turned around by their circumstances and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"reality, in which the land lives, does me hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforted me that all men - also those who have killed and so much damage, we can teach us some and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo GonzÃ¡lez, the commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example, DarÃ­o de JesÃºs Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">Columbians was prophesy that after drainage peace would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But that is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as it is inequality, hunger and a lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to attack arms and protest for their rights and that is also completely justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now focus on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"therefore we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter which race, religion or ideology they belong - to all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, as we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I got it to do with the fear; it was a Muslim, a caudal name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for it to be respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I got threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - Related, foreigner, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">This was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some remote relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">They created absurd demands: some said to me, I need to prove it by running out above without the roads, others wanted that I was not changed at the official television in Grosny and say that I was not changed my sex, that everything was just bad, and Photoshop. "</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have KÃ¶rber size C - what should I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some older people spoke my mother on the streets.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world not only of your family, but the whole of the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"so, my mother became too much and she lay a strick around the neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">I moved into an apartment and a few hours later under the window a car was filled with dark windows and a numeric plate with a 95.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that there was a bit lazy."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends over-tested the numerical signs - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you have fled?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I do not want to give up their names, but I will say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help I left the country, but then something happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before leaving Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought it without having to register, without permission, without any anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and cast them into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Came and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my cell phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"in the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe, you heat in security, just because you leave the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"our people already know, in which hotel you steckel. you even know your room number."</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in touch with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about the sex-equation we are not talking, this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional kaukasic elements are still working in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"so much I also wish, this spiritual barrier can I not overcome."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I am always saying that, as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to hurt them."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually give me effort to look like the person who reminded them of their past - thus to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed dorms?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: last week I submitted a report in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">For the necessary I needed up-to-date information about the situation in Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who has sent one and a half months in Argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during Ramadan were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait, and he did not shut down a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they are now concentrating on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"so I mean, they probably invite the relatives to which they take care of the problem with the person concerned and in the end require proof that the so-called" honour "has experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there still swaist men to be recorded in this secrecy?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there were just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then especially those who have no rich relatives, or have been dropped from their relatives to place Kadyrows Court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are stuck there so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say: if they are killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim them, they could have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not simply disappeared, they have submerged yet to be radicalised."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is this now just a mutation, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just met someone who was imprisoned in Argun and a half-month.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people were gone to prison after having grown beard.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has since been nothing new of them.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them with them.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person himself was, when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"however, until now, they were not presented as bandits, so far there were no reports. we suggest that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why else could you not have allowed this man to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">"do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of men who belong to a so-called" non-traditional "orientation, already taking place in the past?"</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always carried my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think that before 2003 I was already quite known when I lived there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"from 1998 to 1999 when the sharia was considered, I had never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than it is now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally wanted to bring us to the" "civil war" "but ultimately has thrown back into the stone-time."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: what is possible under the sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">Sabrina: my eyebrows were exhausted; I had colored lashes. tube for jeans or short sleops.</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Security Ministry of sharia has never cheered me just a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people like me met."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew thereof; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">In the Chechen language there is a phrase: Kharda ma Kharda. that is: "Spotte does not mean the unhappiness of another.</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun on the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never sinned, never hunted, never hunted."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace be held?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrow came to the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"once he was appointed Minister of Prime Minister, he began to talk about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he does not talk about us per se, but above the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless - you could feel, how the people in the city began to change."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"who caught up before and had eight, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel the situation in the Republic of the Republic was constantly worse."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going on now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn a lot - 700 to 800 dollars a month in the USA are not much.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still working as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teacup, gatherings, I understand them to the hospital and help them to get essences."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I do not have a penny for them.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I classy.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslima and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: this is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechnya, who want to know you with foam before the mouth, that there is no gays among them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestanans have which, the cabine have which, the Russians have also which; on the whole planet, there are - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I come here so many men from the Caucasus.</seg>
<seg id="2388">"many of them - practicing Muslims, who go to the mosque and during Ramadan - live together with men."</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many thinking about transitions to men who love men, and they believe that you will be sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different types of feeling, to be exact, different settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important to feel me in my own skin and not ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Don't know if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"I'm sorry that I will be here personally, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I just know that I am myself.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, even with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under CC0 Creative Commons license.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the opinion written by AyomanÃ©minas and originally published on the website AfrofÃ©minas. the article was subject of several discussions where many different positions have expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">They can be read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminine, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well-thought scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminine and why we generally should be all feminists *.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, that women still earn less money in spite of equal education than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes about what they are allowed to do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women live sooner or later in various areas of life to a smoother ceiling, and discrimination based on sex still draws over through the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All of this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">I am convinced that I am double and threefold.</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"yet, if I am speaking on skin colour, on racism, on black CIS women, on black transitions women, on black women in the LGBTQ community or on black women from the Diaspora, if I mention, in which way we have been physically, pastoral and verbal abuse, decide to remain silent in as well as outside the feminist movement, to mention many white feminists and white intersectionale feminists."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but nevertheless, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift their voices and "Kumbaya," my Lord "to sing" to achieve equal rights (some) of women. "</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about it, that in addition to sexualised violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence, that we are exposed black women to two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnicities and their origin-regions deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girl and girls are often referred to school with a migration background more often than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres, and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in the partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have the same rights all men and all men of any skin color; on the other hand, I cannot consider myself as a black woman, in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to refer to the gender as well as the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and I will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist sphere, who always rejected me and countless other black women and rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"Luke's 1851 in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and also I refused to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical way a dehumanly and marginalised essence."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to include groupings, which also absorb our customs and customs, in order to advance its egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer seek to prove white women the importance of the overcut of skin colour and gender. for some of them continue to keep the importance of black women for the feminist movement total, no matter how many black women try to instruct them for a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although the intersectional Feminism was founded to give women of different homes a home and confesses itself from the white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">I prefer to get rid of myself fully and entirely by feminism and to tie myself to the movement of Womanism that was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman rather than a white feminist paradigm so stubbornly being celebrated as a novel phenomenon.</seg>
<seg id="2460">"it is more important than ever, that we define black women according to our own ideas and move into the sphere of being created by us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weem, the author of the book Africana womens: Reclaiming Education (about: Africa-Womanismus: how we can defend ourselves) by creating ourselves on our own way, in which they are completely safe and in which the cultural, mental, spiritual, physical, and even the spiritual elements can be revered, which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion after they have read these lines, please inform yourself about the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement that the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a bluristic environment, I can uplift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman as a part of this paradigm.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has not passed, nor ignored."</seg>

<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed for the protection of the persons concerned.</seg>

<seg id="2485">Some days later the second woman moved back their ad.</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women have refunding at all once, they generally receive no support from the state."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women also depend financially dependent on men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be the victims of violence, sign up at all with law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"content 1 strokes and Statistical 2 Invisible women and a judicial system, which is nothing short-up of Paraguay: good approach, defective conversion of wounds and statistics"</seg>

"</seg>
<seg id="2491">The figures available are however highly alarming.</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, at the District-country-head office 9600 ads went on account of domestic violence. at 70% of it, it was about violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads were in the police of women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence at the peace of peace. here, 86% of the ads came here."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women told that they were physically interfering, 55% of women spoke of psychic abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true scale of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the paraguan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only few of these crimes are actually indicated." on any woman who is refunded in Paraguay through psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this. "</seg>
<seg id="2498">"refunded to any woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, come two women who do not do so," she declared the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not an own criminal offender, the prosecution authorities are not able to document the prosecution authorities as many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"alone until August 2016, journalists were killed at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>

<seg id="2505">"before Mariana BrÃ­tez was the strong friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called his name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't really wanted to do that, but after all, this should be repented for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer working with Carlos. but for two years she bore mental violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time, the most severe recognition:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I had never thought that I would be victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read earlier about it, I always thought that the only woman happens to be subserviced because they deceive themselves of violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that I would never happen.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana useless social media to report about the mission through Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without name them, she wrote posts on Facebook where they described his insults and different attacks during their two-year relationship, and told how he insulated them."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos themselves. he asked rhetorically, whether he ever raised the hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had fallen by Carlos so long and left him not earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">"it seemed almost that, as they wanted to say that victims of abuse at least have had a certain degree of complicity."</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not of Paraguay, fought almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, in order to prove that their former partner they failed."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te CREO ("I believe you") that consists of women who are all victims of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">"her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worthless."</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat her.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victorias ads with the authorities were without a result and also of their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"it led a trial against its former partners who developed into an impregnable legal struggle between Paraguay and their home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and influence of their former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays Laws: good approach, defective realization "</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay, there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">The display of compounds is a path full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary. "says Victoria Santos.</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN Organisation for Women in Paraguay, also sees great problems when applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was adopted in the paraguan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# 8217;)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the movement # NiUnaMenos (# NonEineWeniger) is part of a campaign on Twitter that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original design of the law foresees to explain the arbitrary criminal offense and harder to punish as it is already in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the legislative text in some points was altered to also gain members of the law so that the path for decriminalisation of abortions are paved, which in Paraguay have generally been prohibited and punished with up to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill was foreseen, most of the (bureaucratic and economic) surgeries which must carry the victims of violence by themselves, if they just need to refund and receive a safe accommodation to obtain the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">"Echauri argued that the law is not effective, if the legislature does not make sufficient financial resources available to it:"</seg>
<seg id="2535">In Paraguay's abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relations.</seg>
<seg id="2536">"here, a change must take place, so that violence does not see more than something normal."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"in view of these facts, he complicates himself and contributes to the perpetrators of offenders."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We have to refunding for such a long time until abuse is no longer regarded as normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"however, on 10 November 2016, the law was adopted in paraguan Senate. previously, parts of the law were cancelled. among other things, a passage was canceled, which called the partners in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are taken apart.</seg>
<seg id="2541">The section regarding reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggressor to attack his victim again.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"however, the deletion of the words" gender, "" political force "and" sexual harassment "from parts of the law is considered a great retreat."</seg>

<seg id="2552">"the rule of the Sultans is marked by the persistence efforts of security forces, including freedom of press, including press freedom, limiting and human rights defenders, independent journalists, bloggers and other activists, to intimidate and detention."</seg>
<seg id="2553">"the authorities limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and are citizens, also activists, to express their views on the public affairs of the country such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline."</seg>
<seg id="2554">"the attack on the Azamn paper, its closing and detention three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country."</seg>

<seg id="2587">Ranjit Warriors 2016 in Zambia and picture with its consent</seg>
<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. this is a growing area, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for the need for medical research on-site medical research: there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the particular medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria, in the poorest countries of Africa have far more serious impacts than elsewhere, and lack of investment for exploring these diseases through the pharmaceutical companies are a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"secondly, research, which is carried out by African scientists, in building its own research capacity in Africa. a major role for science and technology can only be beneficial for the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrior is Director of the Center for research on infectious diseases in Zambia (Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ)."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic was the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for academic studies in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he researched himself on HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the sambian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrior talks about the future of medical research in Zambia and about misconceptions in the media about this research."</seg>
<seg id="2597">(disclaimer: Dr. Warrior speaks as a private one).</seg>
<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GV): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrior RW: currently the focus of my work on the application of research results. I support the sambian national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I just started a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"GV: what do you think are the most important scientific papers in your country, and generally in Africa?"</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">Rw: there are no basic research here. we only bet solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always be beneficiary instead of being the makers."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well used in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How simple or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">Rw: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are differently encouraged.</seg>
<seg id="2611">"it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here, because the funding and development opportunities are better in other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">Which obstacles are there in your routine research that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">Rw: the basic infrastructure does not correspond to the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to ensure continuous supply of electricity, water and the Internet. "</seg>
<seg id="2615">"laboratory material is expensive, and it takes months to import it from other countries."</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">Rw: there are interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how large is your opinion the potential of scientific research in Africa, where should it focus on, and how can we support development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">Rw: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, research of space, health care (non-transferable and contagious diseases) and efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit from it very much."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the pros and cons of life as a scientist in Africa over Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"rw: often it is the limited speed, things to do, and the required access to scientific expertise that are facing challenges."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that reviews articles can only be made available to payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limited the amount of available information and speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers will change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the Ensia.com website, a magazine that reports about solutions to environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredth, the first plant that has been cultivated and consumed by NASA astronomauts in the outer space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years Morton's work was done only by its own imagination and the question, how many salads can get it."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but in the beginning of the 2000s, he noted that more and more salads were patented, and that he was not able to use them further."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only used for individual varieties, but also for specific properties such as resilience over diseases, a special Rotor or greenish leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more of such patents have been registered for more and more plants such as grain or carton pieces. because of these trends, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts provide food safety for food production in the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia, Morton still chastier salad, he now needs more, since its work is increasingly difficult due to ever more limitations."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like being lying in a river a bump in order to paddles.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that right now, but it is a break with the breeding-tradition," he says. "I think that this patents go too far at Salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and when they stand in court, no one can breed any new lettuce, because all the features are already patented, and tries to breed those characteristics that he wants."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to use no material that is protected as a intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he also joined a movement that is getting bigger in the US and throughout the world: open source Breeding (" "Open Source" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space-station ISS have bred the red Roman salat of the sort Outredhorn in the "greenhouse." the station is bred and eaten there it will be tested whether plants grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">"it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like this, as if the movement from the IT area date back and not from the field of plant breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2644">The Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for "Open-Source" seed) can be inspired by the movement for free "open source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">"it was brought into life to ensure that some plant species and gens are not protected as intellectual property, and so are usable for plant breeders."</seg>
<seg id="2646">"in the context of the initiative, named Ossi, U.S. breeders can commit themselves that others can freely use seeds from them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds, and sell them." open source "breeders allow only others to breed their seeds, to breed so own varieties, and it is not immediately auditory - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant pators."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi-board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over seed and the possibility to breed new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"he reportedly played a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, rights of farmers, control over the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would attempt to exploit the latter not or only little by raising seeds with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">"Kloppenburg emphasizes that the" "open source" "movement does not work with genetically modified crops."</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented if vegetables, corn, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"" "food-sovereign without seed levels is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative commit themselves to putting other seeds freely available to others. thus, its action in contrast to patent stands for seeds and plant features."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi-supporters argue that the future of food supply is jeopardized, as the available genetic pool due to the becoming increasingly popular intellectual property rights in plant material, which is therefore always restricted, incessantly deplated."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, Executive director of the Ossi, has engaged in her thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that about a third of all carton characteristics is protected as intellectual property, making it usable for plant breeders either at all or only difficult."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"for other plants there are such estimates still not yet, but experts like Luby suspect that massacres are patented, like wheat in still larger style, than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants become so bred that they have targeted features - from such, through which their tastes or colour improves through to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">Opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeder is decreasing due to more and more patents. genetic diversity is currently less necessary than ever since the changing conditions by climate change are much worse predictable.</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker in Carly Scaduto believe that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsantos. with a total of four commercial banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the United States, the company is set up for the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property must promote other breeder" patents as "patents and the protection of plant-based innovation." "a patent is basically taken a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent has expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions are going to help others with another method to get the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but supports them by providing more material and know-how to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton looks different: 20 years waiting for a patent, but certainly no innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait for such a long time, to grow to plants that have been adapted to the changed environmental conditions, they would have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources were always a general good, and they should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and moneetincentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what motivates us, and it is impossible for us to continue using the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in total, Morton revolves at the concept of patent covering:" we do not really create the features themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants are formed by themselves and as breeders, we ultimately have no idea of how plants do this."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol depot, plant breeding-in in the U.S. state of Oregon and Ossi pre-board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" "who marching a variety, also raise its own values into it."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monokultures, are needed for their cultivation of mass bibicides, who are breeding in his varieties of this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is very agreeable. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto are) patents, creating the most smaller seed companies, even without patents - either reject it or they keep it for too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton is looking for in his breeding garden salads.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also the view that breeder by the Avoid of plant pators," it looks like I am with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than businesses. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I need a constant new material for my catalog, as I know that my competitors are selling my varieties in a couple of years ago," he says. "with a patent one is 20 years before competition, with which I think it is very nice to do."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US appears to be a leading in the" Open Source "," the concept spreads rapidly around the world. "</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ") describes itself as a professional organization in the area of resources, a" open source "seed programme; the centre with farmers work together and helps them to breed new varieties, which meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"it also supports them to come to" "Open Source" "seeds and sell their own."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Catcol is working on an" open source "license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeder in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive powers of the European Union, the European Commission declared that conventional cultivated plants should not be patenting. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European patent pending patent, which permits patents in conventional cultivated plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"an explanation is not yet a law; now it is to the governments of the Member States, the patent pending patent to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, at the farmers, operators of seed commercial banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all Eastern Africa to learn something about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend for the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos's program for" open source "seed systems, that the organization is currently being a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, which will be planned next year of the official start signal."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a merger from environmental protection and development groups (including hivos, the international nonprofit-development aid organisation USC Canada and the action group to erosion, Technology and Concentration) has compiled a database to seeds and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - a network of aid organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others - published a report that farmers must have the opportunity to share in seed, to exchange and improve the seed policy to ensure stable supply of foods."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a context that Luby from Ossi hopes to see him soon more people."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and organic food is mainly cultivated where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role," so Luby. "we now try to clarify people that are even more behind their foods."</seg>
