this is James R@@ isen .
you may know him perhaps because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times magazine .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA listened illegal phones from Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; therein , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA placed literally dra@@ fts for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who the chapter did not fall at all ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has been established against r@@ ams and urged him to name its alleged historical sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the pattern of government , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to condemn and journalists to pit@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; according to First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right , if media do not get this information and if they can not protect identity of the mud that they give . &quot;
&quot; so when the government in R@@ isen , he did something what many courageous re@@ porters did before him : he refused , and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something exceptional . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they were for years that it is essential for their case , the demands of the government have been dropped off . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can hide less and less .
&quot; instead of being able to fail and bring them up to the statements , they could do their digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , his phon@@ em@@ ailed secret , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and banking information , his loan agreement , and even travel hints with the list of its flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling , a CIA wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers and ris@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect his attack , wh@@ ist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers . but instead , the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government is too much about its job as a secret . &quot;
since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers to a journalist .
&quot; so we set up the press work to be protected by the first constitutional order , because the government has more and more possibilities to pronoun@@ ce all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology of the government allows the rights of re@@ porters to handle , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; from the moment they can get in contact from the moment they contact , rather than in retrosp@@ ect ; &quot;
&quot; today there is communication software , which has not yet been written as R@@ isen &apos;s book , and it is much safer than regular e @-@ mails or telephone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open @-@ source super@@ structure system for W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the internet fam@@ ousness , which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , where I work , developed further . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just as with any ordinary contact form . &quot;
these will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant message agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot proc@@ ure any more information secretly , and many of the information they would be requested would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; however , Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are always developing new sp@@ y technologies that are all je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zing us . &quot;
&quot; it is to us to make sure that not only technology den@@ omin@@ ator like Edward Snow@@ den have a way of doing mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
who wants to report about abnorm@@ alities in the supply of soldiers and report by crowded hospitals . or the next environmental workers who alarm the alarm for poll@@ uted water from F@@ lin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street In@@ sider warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to safeguard our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thanks .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the largest data le@@ ak of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; un@@ veil that emp@@ ires and mighty works have hidden &#91; enormous amount of money in tax hav@@ ens . &#93; &#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we collect Robert Pal@@ mer by Global W@@ here@@ to an explanation . &#93; this week we were published by messages about a le@@ ak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax hav@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca go and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up it ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the emails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences already .
Islands Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
&quot; also , there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bashar al @-@ Assad letter firms in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia &apos;s President Vladimir Putin will lead to over a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous Cell@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release , and on the next revealing documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or an John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems cri@@ es from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we take this ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens and not all pay all their taxes , then this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and this affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , global calves , these revelations are phenomenal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax hav@@ ens are used by some few to hide and conce@@ al their assets -- something that we discussed for ten years and un@@ veil . &quot;
&quot; I think many people will be very confusing all over the world , and it is hard to understand how these tax hav@@ ens work . &quot;
I always present it like a mat@@ r@@ jo@@ king ba@@ b .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is . &quot;
I find it interesting too that in the US there are less reports of this matter .
&quot; presumably because there were no prominent Americans until now , those in those revelations , that sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; now , it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax hav@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; however , by the principle after which these tax hav@@ ens work , Mos@@ bag Fon@@ se@@ ca has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we would have a data le@@ ak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to create a firm as to get a reference point of view . &quot;
&quot; this kind of lack of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts , school children . &quot;
it has sc@@ ei@@ vers allowed to zoom in particularly suscep@@ tible investors .
it is this kind of behavior that all concerns us .
here at Global W@@ hat@@ s we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does that actually work ?
&quot; so , we sent a co@@ vert investig@@ ator in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan . &quot;
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
shocked us really that all except for a lawyer of our investig@@ ator made suggestions about how to transfer his money .
&quot; these were all pre@@ dict@@ ations . none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course no one was handed over to anyone . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to consider this not as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who submitted our co@@ vert proposals .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is not about a single top political leaders , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , established by the corruption , tax evasion , poverty and instability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we must change the rules . &quot;
we need to change the rules in order to deter these kinds of behavior .
&quot; this may sound very dull as if we could do anything about it , as if nothing could ever changed , as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite a lot to change .
&quot; over the past few years , we have witnessed a more transparency in the past few years , as regards the owners of companies . &quot;
&quot; the issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland . &quot;
&quot; since then , the EU has been recorded in central reg@@ isters at the national level , who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a law draft in both parliament@@ arians , but this does not make progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama &apos;s revelations , this huge insight into the world of tax hav@@ ens , used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global . &quot;
for us at Global Wel@@ sh this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who become angry when they see , how other people can hide their true identity behind spot@@ lighted firms . &quot;
&quot; we need executives in the economy , which stand up and say , &quot; In@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of transparency . &quot;
&quot; together , we can finish the in@@ transparent , which now enables this type of tax evasion , corruption and money la@@ undering . &quot;
that is the story as I had almost kidn@@ apped and in the trunk of a red Maced@@ onian .
&quot; one day after I finished my design study , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
&quot; there was a guy in the red ma@@ da , and looked at my things . &quot;
he bought one of my works of art .
&quot; he was alone in the city , and made a road trip across the country . afterwards , he would go to the peace cor@@ ps . &quot;
I invited him on a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I got tired .
&quot; while we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; Where are you sleeping for tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I do not know . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who knows the situation not ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he said it , he would go to the peace of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he &apos;s really planning . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maced@@ onian ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; Come , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the blan@@ ket and thought : &quot; &quot; Oh dear ! what did I get there ? &quot;
a game of alien@@ ation in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I rose from the bed , at ti@@ ck@@ tops at the door , and my bedroom door lock . &quot;
but he was not crazy .
we are still in touch .
&quot; the artwork that he bought from me is today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my view .
&quot; perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners , actually friends , who were only waiting to be discovered on them ? &quot;
&quot; to accomo@@ date people on my air mattress , was normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; take a leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ ite , my fellow @-@ room@@ mate and the rent will be increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all the hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I believe , creativity can be able to transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I have over how we could make some money . our apartment is included in a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk , including a mattress and every morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created such &quot; air conditioning and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed and Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three bl@@ iss@@ ful guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air conditioning on wooden floors .
they found it great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our che@@ eses tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them all the city . when we had passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , star@@ red Brian and me . &quot;
had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent again ?
things came into the roles .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czyk , joined us as developers . &quot;
we wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept .
&quot; we presented our Invest@@ ors &quot; &quot; we want to create a website where people publicly post their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite the alien people to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited that the rocket would ign@@ ite .
indeed they do not .
&quot; no one , who is still entirely sol@@ ace , would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have learned as children that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you pop up on the things you can do . we could design . &quot;
at the Kunst@@ akademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and hap@@ tics -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we learned how to design@@ ate objects , but now we wanted to create trust through design , among people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make such a thing ?
is it possible to create confidence with design ?
&quot; I would like to give you a sample , which degree of trust we asp@@ ed . &quot;
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile in the hand .
now I would like to rel@@ ieve your mobile phone .
give your ent@@ in@@ ting mobile phone to your left hand rest .
&quot; this silent flight of panic , whom you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time . &quot;
&quot; the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone , is your home . &quot;
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to keep the embarrass@@ ed mobile phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most of them feel the responsibility .
so even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
only ever so , who has actually Al Gor@@ an &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you also pro@@ claim on Twitter that he comp@@ iles to the President of the President ?
you can now return the mobile phones now .
they have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you of some discoveries .
what if we have changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour would have revealed only once with his name ; if he would tell wh@@ ence he does come , how his dog or his children would say ? &quot;
&quot; imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements , all say , &quot; &quot; he can really keep very well @-@ paid cell phones ! &quot;
how would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ designed feedback system strengthens the trust .
in the beginning we did some things wrong .
it was difficult for people to judge negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their jud@@ gements until we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we performed a study done with Stan@@ ford . we examined how probably it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are with regard to age and residence . &quot;
little surprising that we trust the people most of the most .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social for@@ bi@@ ases .
&quot; exciting , it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; if one has less than three divisions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if one has more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation is sti@@ cking in common .
the right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can expect from them . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if one tells too little , like &quot; &quot; hi ! &quot; , &quot; you get rather no answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells you a lot , as for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is also rather not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , for example &quot; &quot; T@@ olle art@@ works in your apartment ! I make it with my family holiday . &quot; &quot;
how can I create design with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which subjects one should write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners .
&quot; what we had not reck@@ oned , was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to break down these prejudices . &quot;
here you can see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; firstly , incredibly good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the tirel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; third , a need that has not been covered before . &quot;
for us the business runs very well .
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything is smoothly running . &quot;
there were guests who have un@@ allowed part@@ ying or dwell@@ ings .
hosts have guests in the rain stand .
&quot; in the beginning of the project , I have worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone . &quot;
I stood at the front front if trust was broken .
there is nothing sh@@ lim@@ mer@@ it than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I think only of it .
&quot; the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the lawyers , was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , I had only a fraction of the 123 million nights only a fraction ever . &quot;
for people trust each other too right .
&quot; if trust works , it can emerge curi@@ osi@@ ties . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host brought him to the hospital .
he even ended blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals .
&quot; Javier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real prot@@ ector that save one &apos;s life , even though they don &apos;t know at all . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you dies , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books over . &quot;
they can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
so naturally not every stay does not work .
but these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled for the first time about this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together ?
it is a matter of economic trading .
&quot; but now it just means &quot; &quot; to call &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; &quot; , the thing is not justified . &quot;
Share Economy describes a trade in which human relationships promises .
&quot; people lay a part of it open , and that changes all . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , it is easy to compare with Fast Food . it is efficient and reliable , but there is less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what would however , if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be ? &quot;
&quot; what if at any place you were visited , a group there would be Ans@@ wer to wait to fill out a thoroughly and show a pub that have never heard of a tavern tour of which one has never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; today , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would like to shape apartments from scratch from scratch ?
how would this look like ?
what if cities would assume the thoughts of the common part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and de@@ preci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korean capital Seoul , this project has already begun . many parking spaces included in the government , &quot;
&quot; children offered are offered . students who were looking for a lead , &quot;
&quot; were passed on to men whose children were pulled off . they were started In@@ cub@@ ator programs , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . on our platform alone , 7@@ 85 000 people will be hosted in 191 countries by a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught .
we did not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was there before .
there were already similar websites before us .
so why has it just been working ?
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudices .
I find it amaz@@ ingly ;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it whenever a red Maz@@ da passes over to me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve any problem . &quot;
&quot; but if we could help , if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use design soon . &quot;
thanks .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
or sup@@ pressed an bra@@ in@@ doctr@@ ination ?
or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions .
the media are people who look like me .
one study revealed that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people do not speak to their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslims , it is great to meet you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee maker -- dou@@ bling es@@ pres@@ so , with cream . &quot;
I am intro@@ ver@@ ted ;
&quot; a Mö@@ ch@@ te@@ er @-@ Fitness @-@ fan@@ atics , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual mushroom . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born so . &quot;
I have decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 years old , I met the decision to ou@@ sted me . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a homo@@ sexual man , like some of my friends , but as Mus@@ lim@@ ine . I decided to wear my head coverage . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friend@@ ships were horri@@ fied , &quot; Why are you oppressed you yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the Lus@@ ent was : back then it was a feminist declaration of independence , and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to make myself a perfect and un@@ reachable beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ d with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , asked in question , dou@@ bt@@ ful and believed in the end . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
she was trust and slow dedication which coinci@@ ded with any reading of the Quran .
the beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to crying .
I know myself in it . I feel that God knows me .
&quot; had you ever feeling that somebody you perceive , you fully understand , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels like that .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineering . &quot;
&quot; I had later , after my marriage , a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American dream . &quot; &quot;
then that terrible morning came in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I was sitting in my kitchen , had stopped at the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; E@@ il@@ ess . &quot; &quot;
&quot; smoke , planes flew in buildings , people sp@@ out of the buildings . &quot;
what was it ?
an accident ?
a technical disorder ?
my shock turned into rebellion quickly .
why should one do something ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... Muslim terrorists &quot; ... &quot; ... in the name of Islam , ... &quot; &quot; ... &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; it has not only been attacked my country , but in the N@@ u , related me the actions of others from a civil society into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the West West in the United States to move into a new city and start building studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as I took home -- so deep it went to my seat , and I feared the first time as Mus@@ lim@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment , in a new city , in which it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I saw , saw , and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; be vig@@ il@@ ful in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; obli@@ ging you not . &quot;
I stayed the whole week inside .
then it was Friday that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage of the programme .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ fil@@ tered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims , or by people , who held for Muslims , were free and stroke . &quot;
there were really br@@ aces on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country .
I have read the anger of the people to the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain itself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
these are the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can actually hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we rid them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as of a tumor in the US .
it just raises the question : are we mal@@ ign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
&quot; you know : a mal@@ ign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole , and a ben@@ ign tumor can be seen only under observation . &quot;
the alternatives are meaning@@ less because the question is false .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , no tumor in the body of the USA , but a vital organ . &quot;
thanks !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , Er@@ sth@@ eses and Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques make safer for you ?
&quot; there may be perhaps a few parking spaces , but not stop the terror . &quot;
&quot; the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith , and to show greater citizenship . &quot;
&quot; and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington D.C. , DC recently told : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are not radic@@ alised in their cellar or in bed before a computer .
&quot; in the radic@@ alization process , one has noticed that it begins online . as a first , the person can cut off from their church , even by their family , that the person believes that the terrorists are the real Muslims , and anyone who desp@@ ise their behavior and their ideology is a tra@@ itor , or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alization , we have to stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some are still claiming Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a person , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add ourselves to their imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thanks !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x frac@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology to their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when one thro@@ ws a look at it , it is not driving what they are in their &quot; Holy Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that they can read these things in Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
&quot; a girl came to him , because she had pre@@ tend to join the IS . &quot;
I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with a radical religious leader .
&quot; he said the problem was just the opposite . every cl@@ ergy , having talked to her , she brought the silence and told her that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their anger , it was a primary goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extremis@@ ts who spoke a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m made the connection to God and its congregation .
&quot; instead of having acc@@ using it for their anger , he showed her constructive paths for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , did she to join the IS . &quot;
it was an insight that the Islam@@ ophobia and my family are concerned .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect anyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour use of fear affect our democracy every day , for our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually , several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , pass at least three things . &quot;
we do accept an author@@ itarian government system to conformity and prejudices .
&quot; one study reveals : if one reports trial messages , in which negative about Muslims was reported , they considered more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just a academic problem .
&quot; when looking at when the mood against Muslims rise upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 - then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two voting periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ ophobia is not simply the natural reaction on mosquito terror , as I expected it . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to increase the foundation of a free society , the rational and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning .
&quot; we may sense it perhaps as the first , but the toxic air of fear mer@@ es us all . &quot;
&quot; in the assignment of collec@@ tiv@@ ism , it is not only about to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple that lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both were going to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athle@@ te .
&quot; he was on the dental faculty , talented , much promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet , generous man known . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when has become such a sealed young man out of my br@@ other@@ ly ? &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after visiting Su@@ z@@ anne on her brother and his wife , her neighbour , Craig Stephen Hi@@ cks , she murdered , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ or who had visited in the afternoon . he did it in her apartment , as he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page . &quot;
he flo@@ wed eight times at De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be mor@@ ally but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
are we going to the mosque or have we stayed at home ?
&quot; we bes@@ ought it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion free . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s office , we went in silence , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , my shoes went out , went into prayer @-@ all , and what I saw , let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , than@@ ked and called our guests , for half of the gathered were Christians , Jews , Buddh@@ ists , athe@@ ists , believers and non @-@ believers who have come , not to attack ourselves , but to join us . &quot;
in that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose from the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be sure number ?
or become connected to those that mean : we are better than those .
many thanks .
thanks beautiful !
Helen Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I ask myself , what do you say those who may perhaps claim that you are a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a den@@ ker@@ e@@ mit with a deep drau@@ ght , so an exception and not the rule are . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed : I would say that you do not pre@@ tend . I am completely normal .
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; when one sees to Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever done study to Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work , and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; if people seem like an exception to the rule , then the rule is broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you very much . D@@ alia Mog@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for Bast@@ ler is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journalism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial d@@ ron@@ es . possible , this is made in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ package fitting into our social consciousness , a autonomous fleet of air machinery at the Fra@@ c Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 ornam@@ ental . a few years ago they began to fly with rop@@ es . &quot;
&quot; by att@@ achments reach aircraft , high speed and acceleration in narro@@ west space . &quot;
you can also build a self @-@ resili@@ ent structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear the loads , to deal with turbul@@ ence and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you a few of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; thus a system works autonom@@ ously , it must know collectively , where in the room the mobile objects are located . &quot;
in our laboratory at ET@@ H Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the fast development of dynamic tasks .
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alisation technology of Ver@@ ity Studios , a representative of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each air@@ machine has internal sensors to determine the position in space , comp@@ ut@@ ations on board , what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands are available on the highest image e . e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; landing &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called H@@ eck@@ starter , &quot;
&quot; a flight device , which tries to beat two flies with a cap . &quot;
&quot; like other Star@@ r@@ ers , it is efficient in the for@@ wards spiral , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all its variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star @-@ fle@@ ets it can float , and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a downside . &quot;
a limitation of tail@@ oring is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind arches .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the air@@ ship no matter in which position the optimal position can be reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
during our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter .
one such question would be like : what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , the pilots @-@ controlled flight devices were able to fly away , which had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a tail@@ gate . &quot;
un@@ long we discovered that flies with just one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically easiest remote device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only a moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no frac@@ tures , hing@@ es and cross @-@ ru@@ der , no further actu@@ ator or controllers , only a prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; though it is mechanical simple , happens inside life very much , so that it can fly stable and move in space can move over . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to the fly , I have to throw it right . &quot;
&quot; the likelihood to throw it exactly right if all watch me , is low , so I am showing you a video that was filmed yesterday evening . &quot;
&quot; when the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is a practice in pleasures , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight pro@@ pane , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symm@@ etrical .
that is why he is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , he receives the poor ability , &quot;
moving in space in all directions regardless of which direction he was rot@@ ated or even as he rotating .
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight pro@@ pane . &quot;
&quot; some is adjustable in models , the rest will be learned directly at flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; if flying machines are to be part of our daily life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine is composed of two separate twin @-@ prop@@ ellers .
this is rotating in the clo@@ ck@@ wise direction
and the other against the clo@@ ck@@ wise .
if you build them together they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter .
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- a motor or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit limited . &quot;
&quot; we will demonstrate that now , by making a half air@@ worthy . &quot;
the last demonstration is investigated synthetic black@@ ness .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expressions . &quot;
we took trading south @-@ sweet micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- every single weighs less than a disk bread -- and equi@@ p them with loc@@ alisation technology and algorithms .
every unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine then I would like to get a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway .
&quot; of course , it is difficult to pre@@ dict the influence of this technology . &quot;
for types such as us is the salary in the development and the creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such spectacular way . &quot;
&quot; the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential , the icing on the cake is the icing on the cake . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; 1,3 billion years ago , cir@@ cl@@ ed in a very far distant galaxy two black holes always faster , you transformed so the mass three suns in a ten@@ ths in pure energy . &quot;
this short moment bri@@ ghter it bri@@ ghter than all the stars together in all galax@@ ies of the whole of us known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but their energy did not put them free in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into the space @-@ time frame itself and the universe was explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
&quot; after all , we arrange the events for a time . &quot;
1,3 billion years ago was a multilingual life on Earth originated .
&quot; since then , the earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , s@@ aur@@ s , people and -- God allow us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group decided especially brave -- R@@ ai Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ronald Dre@@ ver from Cal@@ tech -- to build a huge laser det@@ ector from the Cal@@ tech - for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
they thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the det@@ ective LIG@@ O : the laser @-@ interfer@@ ometer - gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observatory . &quot;
in the follow @-@ up period the precision of LIG@@ O could be substantially increased as the recognition performance enormously improved .
that is why we are now called Advanced LIG@@ O .
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , LIG@@ O was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September 2015 , only a few days after the start @-@ up of the det@@ ector , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two colon@@ ised black holes through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the det@@ ector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were emotional as this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell with my death @-@ sick father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction ! AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physic@@ ist at MIT . he has been investig@@ ating gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves from black holes and their by observ@@ atories like LIG@@ O measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cro@@ ation in the fabric of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction and the other is stretched . &quot;
&quot; to view , faculty in courses for relative theory often lead a really silly dance to dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves extremely weak , even ridiculous . &quot;
&quot; on 14 September , for example , each of us was stretched by us at the beginning of the waves and stretched out . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average human being was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1st Dar@@ um , one told the LIG@@ O employees for crazy . &quot;
&quot; with a five kilometers long laser det@@ ector , and that is absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than a thou@@ sand@@ fold of the radius of a nuclear power . that &apos;s grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text on gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder LIG@@ O , who hunt for the waves in search of the waves : &quot; the technical difficulties when building such det@@ ectors are extensive . &quot;
&quot; but physic@@ ists are glo@@ wing , and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne has published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to LIG@@ O . Scott maintains that LIG@@ O is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wav@@ el@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial lifts , the size of your cell phones . &quot;
this is quite convenient . because so you can make an image or a map of things by view the light around you from several points .
for tones it is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wav@@ el@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you especially much : &quot;
the face of your child approximately .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties such as sound and height , rhythm and volume , in order to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob put them down . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot provide you with simple images from objects in space with them .
&quot; but by considering changes in the am@@ pl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least are for LIG@@ O the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble field .
&quot; therefore , if we convert wav@@ e@@ patterns in she@@ ave , we can hear the all literally . &quot;
&quot; the gravity to listen , can tell us about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time . &quot;
&quot; S@@ H : two black , not rotating holes , cir@@ cus just : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
turn the two body very quickly , you hear the same cir@@ cus with an additional key change . that sounds like Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu @-@ Wu ! &quot;
it is a sort of movement that shaped into the wav@@ e@@ form .
&quot; AA : on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- sounded this as sound of -- S@@ H : ... two black holes with each 30 @-@ f@@ acher sun@@ mass , who revol@@ ve around as fast as the sticks of your mix@@ ers . &quot;
AA : do we think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dense body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 son@@ ites , revol@@ ve each hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces in front of us .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
therein lies the abi@@ ding meaning of LIG@@ O .
LIG@@ O opens up a completely new way to study the universe as never before .
along this path we can listen to the space and the invisible .
much in space may -- virtually or basically -- not visible .
&quot; a super @-@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why mas@@ on stars in Super@@ nov@@ as explo@@ de . &quot;
they are very useful . of them we learned a lot about All .
&quot; however , the exciting physical processes happen at the core , which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never pass through because these op@@ ak are .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves penetrate iron , as if it were more transparent glass . the Big Bang : I would be crazy to explore the first minutes of the Al@@ ls , but we will never see it , because the urine can be obs@@ cured by its own light . &quot;
&quot; with the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves it should be possible , to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we have never seen before , and of which we do not have any idea of things that we just discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , LIG@@ O found equal in the first attempt of things that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the LIG@@ O project , says to this topic : Me : the kind of stars that bring black holes , like LIG@@ O them , are the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . black holes are so to be the s@@ add@@ lers for our arche@@ ological work . &quot;
&quot; LIG@@ O permits us a completely different point of view to the events of all , on the emergence of the stars and ultimately , on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to LIG@@ O , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the cosmos and cir@@ cus des cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be more beautiful than the Big Bang yourself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thanks .
a while ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; one year I would say to everything &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; I feared that I feared . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced me to say &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
would I talk to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
wanted to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , but yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , I feared my fear . &quot;
&quot; to keep my fear , speeches , my social fear -- Pu@@ ff . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a definite yes , which was deeply changed my life , on an unexpected . it started with a question of my youngest . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the youngest , calls for in@@ explic@@ able reasons all &quot; estim@@ ation &quot; &quot;
as if she had a wa@@ it@@ ress from the South .
&quot; estim@@ able , I need milk for my beak @-@ street . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; a new way of life in my family . from then on swe@@ ar I swe@@ ar to always play with them once you &apos;re calling me . no matter what I just do , or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I am not perfect , but I am trying very much . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an astonishing side effect : only recently , I understood that &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am author . I think things look like you are going to live .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I cre@@ ire TV . I produce television .
&quot; I make TV , a great style . &quot;
&quot; in this TV season , I am responsible for getting 70 hours of program into the world . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
&quot; each programme offers hundreds of jobs , which previously did not exist . &quot;
the budget for an episode of a TV broad@@ casts can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode all nine days of four shows , i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars , three broad@@ casts , three broad@@ casting , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my television series are running on Thursday evening .
&quot; throughout the world , my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million people . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created by myself and not just being produced , so still ob@@ last . I have to find time , really silent , creative time to gather my fans at the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four television series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire around the world . &quot;
do you know who is still doing this ?
&quot; no one , therefore am I a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I do not want to impress you with it .
&quot; I say it , because I know what you think , when the word &quot; author &quot; falls . &quot;
&quot; I say to you , so all of you who are working so hard if you are now working a company , a country or a classroom , take a business , or a household , take me seriously if I am saying , I understand that it is not only going on the computer with a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all per@@ spir@@ ation -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work much , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I am in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country from nothing .
&quot; it &apos;s like I turned troops , as m@@ old I on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; thus , one sees a high tone , lying a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and in@@ toxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , sound@@ ing and maternal , cru@@ el@@ ly and sensible . and the best thing is the buzz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when working is going well .
&quot; a buzz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the buzz sounds like a busy road , I could go for ever on her . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , if I declare them the sums that I &apos;m writing to writing that writing is joy . &quot;
do not understand me wrong that does it .
&quot; but the sums -- when I began to work with television production , when I began to work and work , build , create and working together , I discovered this thing , this buzz , this energy . &quot;
the amount is more than writing .
the buzz is action and activity . the buzz is a drug .
the buzz is music . the buzz is light and air .
the buzz is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a buzz , then you can not strive otherwise than to size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling , not different to asp@@ ire to be in size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is what you call the buzz .
or maybe it also means a work@@ a@@ holic .
maybe it is called Gen@@ ie .
maybe it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I do not know .
&quot; I just know that I am not for the failure , and I just know that I love the buzz . &quot;
&quot; I will only say to you , I am a Titan , and I know I will not ask it to question . &quot;
&quot; to make a clear : the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more work there are , the more things more at the same time , the more I am writing history , the more expectations there are . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , not true ? &quot;
&quot; the country , which I @-@ monkey , the marathon , the I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the buzz , the buzz , the buzz . &quot;
I like this buzz . I love the buzz .
I need the buzz . I am the buzz .
am I just this buzz ?
and then the buzz stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ lap , exagger@@ ated , burned . &quot;
the sums stopped .
&quot; now , my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single worker . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ per tells people , &quot; My mom will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; Rem@@ ove , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da Land . &quot;
there are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
you are a baby @-@ Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were hearing . &quot;
the tot@@ aling of the engine is pet@@ ri@@ fied .
I did not love my work any more . the engine was off .
the sums did not come back .
my buzz was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked out weekends , no repentance , nothing del@@ e@@ ful , a Titan sleeps , does not exist , with full heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no buzz .
in me was silence .
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four television programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
I was a preview Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the buzz and the buzz was I .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; ha@@ l you out , bl@@ aming the author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you &apos;re working , you love to be a teacher , a banker to be a teacher , a banker , a mother , you just likes a different and that gives a buzz when you knew the buzz , if the sums up , who is it ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , I can survive in silence ? &quot;
and then I ask my &quot; southern states &quot; wa@@ it@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; I am on the way out there , too late and she says : &quot; m@@ ama , do you play ? &quot;
and I will say no wonder when two things become aware of :
&quot; first , I must say yes to all and secondly , she called me not . &quot;
it calls nobody more &quot; estim@@ able . &quot;
when is this happening ?
&quot; I miss it , if I am Titan and my buzz , and here everything changes before my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you play ? &quot;
and I say : &quot; yes . &quot;
this is nothing special .
&quot; we play and her sisters encounter , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &apos; Every@@ body Po@@ ops &apos; . &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the summ@@ ation , I can &apos;t make anything except that . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quietly .
&quot; the country , which I car@@ afe , the marathon I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they don &apos;t exist anymore . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and hum@@ id kis@@ ses , delicate voices , vig@@ il@@ age and the song in which it &apos;s going to let go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Royal &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so little that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
play is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes on and a energy ub comes in .
&quot; and that is not immediate , but it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the buzz is slowly coming back .
&quot; not full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quietly , hardly audi@@ ble , but it is there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a buzz . &quot;
and now I feel like I &apos;d know a magical mystery .
but let us stay at the cause .
it is love . that is all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the buzz , the working environment , the titanium @-@ environment , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself through broad@@ casts and television hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real buzz is . &quot;
the tot@@ ality is no strength and it is not work @-@ specific .
it is dependent on joy .
the real buzz is dependent on love .
the buzz is the river that comes from the joy of life .
the real sums is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real buzz ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the resulting tasks , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sums is simple and original .
&quot; true buzz is the voice of God in my ear , but maybe I whis@@ pered with God the wrong words , for which God told me that I am an Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little bit of love , a lot more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this for a fixed rule so I can rid myself as a work@@ a@@ holic .
&quot; it is law , I have no other choice . I have no choice but if I want to hear the buzz again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be that simple . I am not good in games , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
&quot; play not just to play , how to work . &quot;
the truth is hur@@ ting ;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
&quot; I always work , because I love it . &quot;
I prefer to work at the workplace as at home .
&quot; this entry is painful , for what kind of man prefer to be than home ? &quot;
&quot; yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of that .
&quot; we come back in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
we make small dance parties ;
we sing and play ball .
we crus@@ hing soap bub@@ bles .
&quot; in doing so , I feel mostly sti@@ ff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always ask for my mobile phone .
but it is o.@@ k .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the sums of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we stopped working with the games ?
you can do it too ! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
&quot; maybe you hold me for naive , for a day @-@ dre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; you have probably right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? you are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a mu@@ pp@@ et Show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me , until they want to make something different . &quot;
&quot; they are wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a Mari@@ enk@@ ins or K@@ eks replaces me .
&quot; and speak my teen@@ ager for whole 15 minutes with me , I am mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more requires not . &quot;
&quot; each can bring about 15 minutes a piece , even at a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes on the walk !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distr@@ action . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children of praying . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my wellbeing , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is considered to have the buzz to have a place for its soul peace . &quot;
&quot; it is not about playing with their own children . it is about pleasure , &quot;
to play &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself in the 15 minutes !
find out what to do good .
find out it and keep it yourself .
&quot; I am not perfect in it . I smo@@ ked and I si@@ ege . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; want to play ? &quot; &quot; just for everything I have given up , when I got my first TV show , when I got a Titan in the training , when I wanted to exc@@ el myself more and more . &quot;
&quot; 15 minutes at the piece , why not full 15 minutes treat yourself ? &quot;
what can be wrong ? nothing !
the buzz came back in my spare time . the buzz seems to return when I don &apos;t work .
work does not work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months it opens a door , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office . I hear a familiar melody , it fills me and my soul . it re@@ direc@@ ts me to new ideas . I use it into full and love my work . &quot;
&quot; I like the buzz , but I do not love it . &quot;
I do not need it .
I am not the buzz , the sums is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bub@@ bles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is now my buzz .
the buzz of life .
the sums of love .
&quot; the amount of labour is part of me , but just a part . and I am so grateful . &quot;
&quot; I sn@@ ap that I am a Titan , and I have never seen a Titan , the trip to Jerusalem . &quot;
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functional . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better work I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the buzz . the country , which I @-@ monkey , the marathon , I run , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the buzz , the sum , the real buzz : the buzz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this sums , the more this unusual , inf@@ ant , naked and new feeling of life in me wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this sums , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am author . I think things out , I awake you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live its dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
for a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to do less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thanks nice .
I am neu@@ ros@@ ci@@ d .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a serious stroke , or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon , it is very frustrating that the brain , as opposed to other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , heavy disability . &quot;
that is the reason why I have functional neuro@@ surgery .
what is a functional neurolog@@ ist ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures .
&quot; surely they have heard of one of the most famous , the &quot; Tie@@ fen@@ hir@@ n@@ stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one can influence a electro@@ de deep inside the brain to influence the circuit boards of neur@@ ons so that the neurological function has improved . &quot;
it truly is an amazing technology . she has improved the fate of patients with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease that suffered severe pain and severe pain .
&quot; however , Neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean Ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the recovery of the brain .
in my opinion we approach this dream .
I want to show you that we are very close .
with some help the brain can help themselves .
history started 15 years ago .
at the time I was leading waiter @-@ doctor and worked day and night in the emergency .
often I cat@@ ered patients with skull @-@ brain trau@@ ma .
they have to imagine that in skull @-@ brain @-@ trau@@ mas the brain is floating and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; to save life , you have to dimin@@ ish the skull of skull . &quot;
&quot; to do this , one sometimes has to remove a part of cri@@ bed bra@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; instead of throwing the cri@@ bed bra@@ ins , we decided to analyze the brain mass by Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , an bi@@ ologist , the brain &apos;s mass . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to grow cells from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to leave cells from a tissue , comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you need to find the right diet , temperature , moisture and the environments to flour@@ ish it . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it managed Jean @-@ François .
that he saw under his micro@@ scope .
this was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
perhaps you still know from the Bi@@ ology lesson that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism .
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain clay in the OP .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are im@@ mortal .
but these cells were very different .
&quot; slowly and after a couple of weeks , they died even . &quot;
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but looked different . &quot;
&quot; we needed long , in order to understand how they came . &quot;
they come from these cells .
these blue and red cells hot dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our Grand du@@ ster cells .
you play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they ensure the shifting of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we do not know that .
&quot; we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury . &quot;
but this is not so safe .
but one thing is clear -- by these cells we received our stem cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing .
this we had to prove .
&quot; so , we decided to develop an experiment . &quot;
we wanted a piece of brain out of the non @-@ language area and then see the cells just as cultivate Jean @-@ François did
&quot; and subsequently , mark them color@@ fully , to be able to follow them in the brain . &quot;
in the last step we im@@ pl@@ ated them at the de@@ posit@@ or of the same individual .
we call the aut@@ ologist Tran@@ splan@@ tation -- Aut@@ op@@ tation .
one of our first questions were : what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we implant the same cells into bra@@ in@@ ward brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ iller , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario , we im@@ planted the cells in a healthy brain , and we observed that after a couple of weeks they had completely disappeared , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not used there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we gave an injury to and im@@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells which were im@@ planted .
&quot; evidence to show they are these little points . these are the cells we left in vit@@ ro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesi@@ on ?
&quot; so , we prepared monkeys with a manual conception . &quot;
they had to take feed pel@@ lets from a tra@@ y .
this they did very well .
&quot; when they had achieved a stable skill level , we last in the mot@@ oric Cor@@ tex the Hand@@ ler@@ ene range . &quot;
&quot; ther@@ eu@@ pon , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move her hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen to men , they recover spontaneously up to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover by means of vivid brain mechanisms . they are rec@@ u@@ perate to a certain degree , just like the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ pl@@ ated his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not as accurate and not as fast as possible .
&quot; now , as we reproduce the cells , the same monkey , two months after the im@@ plantation . &quot;
I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us .
since that time we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can free@@ ze it and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example with Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream still is to im@@ pl@@ ate them with men .
&quot; I really hope that I can show you soon , how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself . &quot;
many thanks .
&quot; Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne , this is wonderful , I am sure that right now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who may need . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on people . &quot;
J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes to come to hospital , and that therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it is hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients .
&quot; it takes a long time to select patients , perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment . &quot;
&quot; after that , you have to apply this to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
&quot; first , one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone . &quot;
BG : and that it is safe . J@@ B : of course .
BG : J@@ oc@@ el@@ y@@ ne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it .
BG : many thanks .
democracy .
&quot; we in the West make a big mistake , they as a matter of course to consider . &quot;
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant , which is in reality but as inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable truths .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great indul@@ it@@ ators in Beijing have dou@@ bt@@ lessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely non @-@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy d@@ wind@@ les with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my old friends , told me that democracy would change when they change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you to believe in together with me to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group believe that we could save democracy , but that we need a percep@@ tible and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are painted , our future ble@@ ak , and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; to the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction , which is currently threatened our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ adox . &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize it as the mountain mountain , who casts its long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt hill , &quot;
but few recognize its Gem@@ ini .
&quot; a mountain of un@@ used cash , which is to be too anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and income to carry with whom you could carry the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars were invested in the US , in England and in the euro zone , in all the wealth of producing goods , such as industrial plants , machines , office buildings , schools , roads , smooth , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars a lot of money , until you compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing did , except the stock exchange and the real estate prices up@@ lift . &quot;
&quot; thus , debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin summit , which does not conform to the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stag@@ nat@@ ing wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 year @-@ olds in the US , Japan and Europe are unemployed , and therefore a low @-@ pan growth , which could not invest in which they do not invest . just like O@@ edi@@ pus father , who from fear , the proph@@ ecies of O@@ ra@@ k@@ els could be true that his son would kill him if he grows , &quot;
un@@ wanted to bring about circumstances that cause oils to kill him .
this is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; all the un@@ veiled funds . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to enhance our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
I believe . but before we continue : what do we mean under democracy ?
Ar@@ ist@@ ot@@ el@@ es defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government as a majority .
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy made of course too many --
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to make the significance of the ath@@ ic democracy on account of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decision of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is , that they have the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gives them the right to political co@@ determination with equal consistency in questions of the state bel@@ lows . &quot;
the ath@@ ic democracy has not held long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines very bright , it is also quickly burned . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ liberal democracies have not left its roots in the ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na C@@ arta , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na C@@ arta , which was ultimately a stat@@ ute for mist@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible , and the democratic process has been confined to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in our present democracies has been occurring since the time , in which this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually hi@@ ked the politics and escap@@ es them . &quot;
wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because these days can be found today in the government , and nonetheless not in power , because the power of politics is emigr@@ ated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hate with capitalism .
&quot; when you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that , so sustain@@ ably the animals , of which it nour@@ ishes , dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end they are hungry . &quot;
&quot; it is similar to the economy that the politics emerged as far as the economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods will be de@@ valu@@ ated , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scar@@ ed to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful of capitalism the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; , the higher the twin summit , and the greater the extravag@@ ance of human labour power and the welfare of humanity . &quot;
&quot; when this is true , it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; dem@@ os &quot; retains control , as in the ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , the women and foreigners . &quot;
this is not a new idea by the way .
the Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn &apos;t anything but good .
&quot; the teaching from the deb@@ acle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a status like in the ancient Athens , without creating new types of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance . &quot;
but there is one solution : creating the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing Ni@@ ed@@ ri@@ glo@@ wing occupied by autom@@ ating and robots .
&quot; the problem here is , so long economy and politics are separate areas , automation and automation summit are higher , the extravag@@ ance , and social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we have to re@@ construct the economy and re@@ unite the areas of business and politics and to ensure that we will develop the re@@ unified field , otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cr@@ acy that may appear the film &quot; &quot; matrix &quot; &quot; as a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth , will survive -- &quot;
&quot; the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved through a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to the &quot; matrix &quot; , &quot; in which machines serve the human beings , and put their energy into the study of the universe , or into a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gora , &quot; in long talks the meaning of life . &quot;
I believe we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it happen , how could it look , this &quot; star Tre@@ k &quot; - utop@@ ia rather than the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from a working place to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company . &quot;
&quot; then , all income from capital and from redeemed and the concept of wage work is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the companies , who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but no exchange between capital and labour , do not have large gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency , issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest Emer@@ ging Markets &#93; , in the interest of the whole of humankind . &quot;
&quot; continue to be tra@@ ded that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; &quot; -- and each government pays the sum , which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant account of the country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment resources are scarce . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes in the Bret@@ ton Woods Conference of 1944 had proposed .
the problem was that at that time they had not had the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we , particularly against the background of a unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world that I describe you is at the same time liber@@ ating , in which they preferred to eat privileged people , and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the du@@ st@@ bin of history , and key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ an@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better . &quot;
thanks .
Bruno Gi@@ uss@@ ani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself in your biography itself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I said precisely , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and business is ... do we do that , technological development will generate such a massive decline of overall economic demand that Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mer &apos;s &quot; long @-@ term stagnation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only destabili@@ ze our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; just like Hay@@ ek , that &apos;s why I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely wir@@ h . &quot;
&quot; BG : actually , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you are not wir@@ r , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein that said this . BG : in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening at dinner of the speakers , you said clearly what you think of the West &apos;s point of view . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a large measure of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal democracies we have the semb@@ lance of democracy .
&quot; as I told in my presentation , we have limited democracy on politics , while the area where most of them play , -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some respects , if I must say that pro@@ voc@@ ative , China today resembles the England of the 19th century . &quot;
because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- this is an error .
liber@@ alism and Liber@@ als such as John Stu@@ art Mill --
&quot; he was very skep@@ tical , which concerns the democratic development . &quot;
&quot; what can be observed now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; now , China has to pre@@ tend to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century , smells amazing to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many list@@ ener is curious about your experiences as a finance minister in Greece &apos;s start of the year .
Y@@ V : I sen@@ sed that this is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later on the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , out of personal view , and very disappointing , because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the eurozone , &quot;
&quot; namely , to say goodbye to self @-@ suffici@@ ency , and the persistent denial made that a massive decay goes through the eurozone and continues to massi@@ vely threaten the development of the whole of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal was , who revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , it is right to do it . unfortunately , the powers within the eurozone , within the European group , continue to vote the denial . &quot;
but you know what comes .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable , by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism in life , you may perhaps delay a while , but when change occurs , it happens ab@@ rupt and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes are you looking ahead ?
Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction .
BG : have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : anyone who looks back -- seriousness ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister , or any Minister there who has been in office after 6 months , especially in such a tense situation , he did not make a mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
&quot; of course , I made mistakes . &quot;
the biggest mistake was to sign the request for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
&quot; I believed that there was an honest interest in the don@@ or , finding a common solution . &quot;
but that was not .
they just wanted to bring our government to case only because they didn &apos;t want to deal with the res@@ is@@ ations caused by the eurozone .
they did not want to conce@@ de that they have been cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
none of the tro@@ ika creditors that have imposed on this policy : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal error .
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive interference of the conversations , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves .
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive .
&quot; for if it does not survive , the acqu@@ itted forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire global economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; when we over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wing the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , after which it appears to me , it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong in this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for you at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; from Roy Price most never heard , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for too many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is premi@@ er at Amazon Studios
the TV @-@ production company of Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has a refreshment and describes on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot;
&quot; Roy has a very important job , because he is responsible for showing the shows and the content showing the Amazon . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one .
&quot; he has to find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of that corner . &quot;
this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ D@@ b website . the valuation proceeds from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review .
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , it is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows , addic@@ tive , where after you looked a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting into the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to offer &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ aras &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it makes more thought about the average yield , the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply ama@@ ze . &quot;
so he must make sure he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something , therefore Roy Price does not want to risk . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he keeps a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and selected by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online , where they can look at any free of charge . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon are out in vain things , you can still fall right ? &quot;
millions of spectators can look at these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know they are observed when looking at this shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , what parts you are ski@@ pped and looks again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide with these data to decide which show they should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and from this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a Sit@@ com by four Republi@@ can US Sen@@ ators . &quot;
you made this show .
does someone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many of them can remember this show because it was not so good . &quot;
&quot; it is only an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,@@ 4 is and Alpha House slo@@ ws with 7,5 -- that is something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time at another company , another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is Ted , Ted Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy is he always looking for finding it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does something different . &quot;
&quot; instead of holding a competition , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , thus the reviews that they give the shows , their course , what shows they like etc . &quot;
&quot; then use this data to find out these little details about the viewer : what shows they like , what producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sit@@ com for four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards &quot; . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has a hit with it , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
&quot; house of Cards &quot; gets a 9,@@ 1 review on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go . &quot;
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very com@@ peti@@ tive , data sealed companies . &quot;
they connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because the logic has somehow been that it should work with everything .
&quot; when you collect millions of data , for a decision that you meet , then you should make a good decision . &quot;
one has 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
you are optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the min@@ de@@ te , what you can expect is good television , or ? &quot;
&quot; when data analysis does not work so , this is a little start@@ ling because we are living in a time when we hold more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does someone here know the company Multi @-@ Health System ?
&quot; no . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health System is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come in touch with this software . come in touch , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dis@@ miss@@ al is made or not . &quot;
just like at Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad .
&quot; medium @-@ sized television , 22 minutes , that can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
&quot; not always , the best results are generated . that &apos;s not because a company like multi @-@ health system does not know how to use data . &quot;
also the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; 2009 , Google announced that through data analysis out@@ breaks of flu , the terrible way can be predicted - through data analysis of the Google research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully well and was a big news release . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly no longer worked , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data flows in decisions of life - in the workplace , in enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
&quot; so , we prefer to make sure that data are helpful . &quot;
&quot; I also know lots of difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ able to use many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or developing a drug . over the years I have recognised some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , breaking this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the parts thereof ; as a broad set you set the parts again to write a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and get together again . &quot;
and now the most important : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help create a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a resolution .
there is another tool to do this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something that is good in which the brain is good , it is parts and pieces to get together again , even if the information is incomplete , especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think I was Net@@ fli@@ x so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use the data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision , how to take all these parts , put together again and make it a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; , &quot; which did not stand in the data . &quot;
Ted Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they went a great personal risk with this decision .
Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used the data to control all their decisions , first as they had to have TV ideas , then as they chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
&quot; it was a safe decision , because they could always say : &quot; this will tell us the dates . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe that things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you are becoming ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball , &quot; it is amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no @-@ question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most probably &quot; -- right here at this moment . &quot;
I will fight it later with a techni@@ c .
&quot; so far I met some decisions in my life , whereby I should have heard in retrosp@@ ect on the ball . &quot;
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much out@@ folded , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the layout .
&quot; perhaps the ball is cl@@ assy and cl@@ assy and cl@@ utter@@ ing . ultimately , it is up to us to make decisions if we want something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging message , that in spite of the large amount of data still pays , make decisions to be an expert in what you do , and risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , there is not the data , but the risks associated with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thanks nice .
