<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him perhaps because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times magazine.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he was spectacular that the NSA listened illegal phones from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"therein, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA placed literally drafts for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who the chapter did not fall at all?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has been established against rams and urged him to name its alleged historical sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the pattern of government, whistleblowers to condemn and journalists to pitched."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right, if media do not get this information and if they can not protect identity of the mud that they give."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government in Risen, he did something what many courageous reporters did before him: he refused, and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something exceptional."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they were for years that it is essential for their case, the demands of the government have been dropped off."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can hide less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of being able to fail and bring them up to the statements, they could do their digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, his phonemailed secret,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and banking information, his loan agreement, and even travel hints with the list of its flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistle-blowers and risens."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect his attack, whistleblowers. but instead, the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government is too much about its job as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">Since September 11 almost every article on national security was the result of a whistle-blowers to a journalist.</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we set up the press work to be protected by the first constitutional order, because the government has more and more possibilities to pronounce all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology of the government allows the rights of reporters to handle, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"from the moment they can get in contact from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect;"</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there is communication software, which has not yet been written as Risen's book, and it is much safer than regular e-mails or telephone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open-source superstructure system for Whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the internet famousness, which was originally developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, where I work, developed further."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just as with any ordinary contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These will then be encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant message agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot procure any more information secretly, and many of the information they would be requested would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the press freedom in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are always developing new spy technologies that are all jeopardizing us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is to us to make sure that not only technology denominator like Edward Snowden have a way of doing misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Who wants to report about abnormalities in the supply of soldiers and report by crowded hospitals. or the next environmental workers who alarm the alarm for polluted water from Flint. or a Wallstreet Insider warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes but to safeguard our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the largest data leak of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" unveil that empires and mighty works have hidden [enormous amount of money in tax havens.] [what does this mean?] [we collect Robert Palmer by Global Whereto an explanation.] this week we were published by messages about a leak of 11 million documents of the law firm Mosbag Fonseca</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mosbag Fonseca go and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up it? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the emails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences already.</seg>
<seg id="47">Islands Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">"also, there are reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad letter firms in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is claimed that a trace of 2 billion US dollars to Russia's President Vladimir Putin will lead to over a close friend of children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are nervous for the next release, and on the next revealing documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or an John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems cries from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we take this?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful ones are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not all pay all their taxes, then this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And this affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, global calves, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and conceal their assets -- something that we discussed for ten years and unveil."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people will be very confusing all over the world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always present it like a matrjoking bab.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these bones."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for prosecution and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really understand what matters is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it interesting too that in the US there are less reports of this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were no prominent Americans until now, those in those revelations, that scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">"now, it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their assets in tax havens."</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle after which these tax havens work, Mosbag Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we would have a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, it is so that in some US states less information needs to provide less information to create a firm as to get a reference point of view."</seg>
<seg id="68">"this kind of lack of transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts, school children."</seg>
<seg id="69">It has sceivers allowed to zoom in particularly susceptible investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that all concerns us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Whats we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does that actually work?</seg>
<seg id="73">"so, we sent a covert investigator in the offices of 13 firms in Manhattan."</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself an African minister who wanted to bring money into the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">Shocked us really that all except for a lawyer of our investigator made suggestions about how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"these were all predictations. none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course no one was handed over to anyone. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">"it is also important to consider this not as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who submitted our covert proposals.</seg>
<seg id="79">"" "it is not about a single top political leaders, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, established by the corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we must change the rules."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules in order to deter these kinds of behavior.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very dull as if we could do anything about it, as if nothing could ever changed, as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite a lot to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"over the past few years, we have witnessed a more transparency in the past few years, as regards the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">"the issue found political attention through British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 Summit in Northern Ireland."</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has been recorded in central registers at the national level, who really lies behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the most unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a law draft in both parliamentarians, but this does not make progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama's revelations, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and global."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Welsh this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who become angry when they see, how other people can hide their true identity behind spotlighted firms."</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need executives in the economy, which stand up and say," Intransparency is not good for business. ""</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use it to end by laws this kind of transparency."</seg>
<seg id="95">"together, we can finish the intransparent, which now enables this type of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">That is the story as I had almost kidnapped and in the trunk of a red Macedonian.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design study, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">"there was a guy in the red mada, and looked at my things."</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">"he was alone in the city, and made a road trip across the country. afterwards, he would go to the peace corps."</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I got tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"while we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," Where are you sleeping for tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" I do not know. "" "</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who knows the situation not?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he said it, he would go to the peace of peace, but I don't know if he's really planning. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Macedonian!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," Come, how please? "</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the blanket and thought:" "Oh dear! what did I get there?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A game of alienation in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I rose from the bed, at ticktops at the door, and my bedroom door lock."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in touch.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork that he bought from me is today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my view.</seg>
<seg id="121">"perhaps the people who were sold to me as foreigners, actually friends, who were only waiting to be discovered on them?"</seg>
<seg id="122">"to accomodate people on my air mattress, was normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"take a leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankite, my fellow-roommate and the rent will be increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all the hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I believe, creativity can be able to transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I have over how we could make some money. our apartment is included in a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk, including a mattress and every morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created such "air conditioning and breakfast" [AIRBed and Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three blissful guests were allowed to sleep with us for 20 dollars on the air conditioning on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheeses tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them all the city. when we had passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, starred Brian and me."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we could find new friends at the same time and pay our rent again?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roles.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as developers."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out whether you could make a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented our Investors" "we want to create a website where people publicly post their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of room whose doors are closed when visiting."</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite the alien people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited that the rocket would ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">Indeed they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still entirely solace, would invest in a shop that allows strangers to sleep in homes of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you pop up on the things you can do. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Kunstakademie we learned that design is much more than just appearance and haptics -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we learned how to designate objects, but now we wanted to create trust through design, among people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create confidence with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">"I would like to give you a sample, which degree of trust we asped."</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile in the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to relieve your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Give your entinting mobile phone to your left hand rest.</seg>
<seg id="157">"this silent flight of panic, whom you can now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door the first time."</seg>
<seg id="158">"the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone, is your home."</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to keep the embarrassed mobile phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most of them feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">So even most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">Only ever so, who has actually Al Goran's cell phone? "</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you also proclaim on Twitter that he compiles to the President of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">They have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you of some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we have changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour would have revealed only once with his name; if he would tell whence he does come, how his dog or his children would say?"</seg>
<seg id="170">"imagine you would have 150 judgements, all say," "he can really keep very well-paid cell phones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-designed feedback system strengthens the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we did some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to judge negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their judgements until we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we performed a study done with Stanford. we examined how probably it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are with regard to age and residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprising that we trust the people most of the most.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social forbiases.</seg>
<seg id="181">"exciting, it is exciting when you add the call of a person -- in our case by judgements."</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three divisions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if one has more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation is sticking in common.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can thus help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you can expect from them."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if one tells too little, like" "hi!", "you get rather no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells you a lot, as for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is also rather not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, for example" "Tolle artworks in your apartment! I make it with my family holiday." "</seg>
<seg id="191">How can I create design with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which subjects one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">"what we had not reckoned, was the great crowd of people who were more than willing to break down these prejudices."</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"firstly, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"third, a need that has not been covered before."</seg>
<seg id="200">For us the business runs very well.</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything is smoothly running."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have unallowed partying or dwellings.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have guests in the rain stand.</seg>
<seg id="204">"in the beginning of the project, I have worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front front if trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing shlimmerit than these calls. it hurts when I think only of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the lawyers, was and will always be our greatest motivation to continue to improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, I had only a fraction of the 123 million nights only a fraction ever."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people trust each other too right.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, it can emerge curiosities."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host brought him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even ended blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attack because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with ample hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real protector that save one's life, even though they don't know at all."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you dies, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books over."</seg>
<seg id="220">They can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">So naturally not every stay does not work.</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transactions are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled for the first time about this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing with money transactions fit together?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is a matter of economic trading.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now it just means" "to call" "rental industry" ", the thing is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade in which human relationships promises.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people lay a part of it open, and that changes all."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, it is easy to compare with Fast Food. it is efficient and reliable, but there is less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what would however, if traveling a rich buffet of local impressions would be?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if at any place you were visited, a group there would be Answer to wait to fill out a thoroughly and show a pub that have never heard of a tavern tour of which one has never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"today, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would like to shape apartments from scratch from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">How would this look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would assume the thoughts of the common part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable us to society and relationships, instead of loneliness and depreciation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korean capital Seoul, this project has already begun. many parking spaces included in the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"children offered are offered. students who were looking for a lead,"</seg>
<seg id="241">"were passed on to men whose children were pulled off. they were started Incubator programs,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. on our platform alone, 785 000 people will be hosted in 191 countries by a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be so crazy as it was taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were already similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has it just been working?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I find it amazingly;</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it whenever a red Mazda passes over to me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve any problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if we could help, if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">Or suppressed an braindoctrination?</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay at the safety check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I do not give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">The media are people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study revealed that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people do not speak to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslims, it is great to meet you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee maker -- doubling espresso, with cream."</seg>
<seg id="270">I am introverted;</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchteer-Fitness-fanatics,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual mushroom."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born so."</seg>
<seg id="274">I have decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17 years old, I met the decision to ousted me."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual man, like some of my friends, but as Muslimine. I decided to wear my head coverage."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friendships were horrified," Why are you oppressed you yourself? "</seg>
<seg id="278">"the Lusent was: back then it was a feminist declaration of independence, and in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to make myself a perfect and unreachable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wd with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, asked in question, doubtful and believed in the end."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">She was trust and slow dedication which coincided with any reading of the Quran.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of the rhythm brings me sometimes to crying.</seg>
<seg id="285">I know myself in it. I feel that God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"had you ever feeling that somebody you perceive, you fully understand, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels like that.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineering."</seg>
<seg id="289">"I had later, after my marriage, a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then that terrible morning came in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I was sitting in my kitchen, had stopped at the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" Eiless. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"smoke, planes flew in buildings, people spout of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was it?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical disorder?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock turned into rebellion quickly.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should one do something?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... Muslim terrorists "..."... in the name of Islam,... ""... "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked my country, but in the Nu, related me the actions of others from a civil society into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the West West in the United States to move into a new city and start building studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as I took home -- so deep it went to my seat, and I feared the first time as Muslimine."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment, in a new city, in which it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I saw, saw, and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, said:" be alert, "" be vigilful in well-lit areas, "" obliging you not. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed the whole week inside.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day in which Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage of the programme.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims, or by people, who held for Muslims, were free and stroke."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really braces on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country have attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have read the anger of the people to the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain itself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">These are the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can actually hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we rid them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as of a tumor in the US.</seg>
<seg id="324">It just raises the question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">"you know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole, and a benign tumor can be seen only under observation."</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are meaningless because the question is false.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, no tumor in the body of the USA, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, Erstheses and Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques make safer for you?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be perhaps a few parking spaces, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">"the regular visit of a mosque leads to people to consider other faith, and to show greater citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as I told me a leader of the police in the Washington D.C., DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are not radicalised in their cellar or in bed before a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the radicalization process, one has noticed that it begins online. as a first, the person can cut off from their church, even by their family, that the person believes that the terrorists are the real Muslims, and anyone who despise their behavior and their ideology is a traitor, or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we have to stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some are still claiming Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a person, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add ourselves to their imagination when you acknowledge them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thanks!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux fracan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology to their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when one throws a look at it, it is not driving what they are in their" Holy Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that they can read these things in Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">"a girl came to him, because she had pretend to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she was in contact with a radical religious leader.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was just the opposite. every clergy, having talked to her, she brought the silence and told her that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that had been given to their anger, it was a primary goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists who spoke a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam made the connection to God and its congregation.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of having accusing it for their anger, he showed her constructive paths for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, did she to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">It was an insight that the Islamophobia and my family are concerned.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect anyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour use of fear affect our democracy every day, for our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually, several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, pass at least three things."</seg>
<seg id="359">We do accept an authoritarian government system to conformity and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study reveals: if one reports trial messages, in which negative about Muslims was reported, they considered more military attacks on Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just a academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when looking at when the mood against Muslims rise upwards -- between 2001 and 2013 - then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in advance of the Iraq war and during two voting periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction on mosquito terror, as I expected it."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulation the public to increase the foundation of a free society, the rational and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may sense it perhaps as the first, but the toxic air of fear meres us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the assignment of collectivism, it is not only about to explain themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple that lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both were going to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was on the dental faculty, talented, much promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the most sweet, generous man known."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when has become such a sealed young man out of my brotherly?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after visiting Suzanne on her brother and his wife, her neighbour, Craig Stephen Hicks, she murdered, just like the sister of Yusor, Razor who had visited in the afternoon. he did it in her apartment, as he posted statements against Muslims on his Facebook page."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be morally but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Are we going to the mosque or have we stayed at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we besought it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion free."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's office, we went in silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, my shoes went out, went into prayer-all, and what I saw, let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and called our guests, for half of the gathered were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who have come, not to attack ourselves, but to join us."</seg>
<seg id="387">In that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had courage and compassion panic and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose from the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be sure number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or become connected to those that mean: we are better than those.</seg>

<seg id="409">"before air-package fitting into our social consciousness, a autonomous fleet of air machinery at the Frac Centre in France has built a six meter high tower from 1 500 ornamental. a few years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by attachments reach aircraft, high speed and acceleration in narrowest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build a self-resilient structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear the loads, to deal with turbulence and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you a few of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of the possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"thus a system works autonomously, it must know collectively, where in the room the mobile objects are located."</seg>
<seg id="416">In our laboratory at ETH Zurich we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the fast development of dynamic tasks.</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localisation technology of Verity Studios, a representative of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each airmachine has internal sensors to determine the position in space, computations on board, what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest image e. e.g." "start" "and" "landing". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called Heckstarter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">"a flight device, which tries to beat two flies with a cap."</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other Starrers, it is efficient in the forwards spiral, much more efficient than helicopters in all its variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most star-fleets it can float, and therefore has great advantages in starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of tailoring is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind arches.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the airship no matter in which position the optimal position can be regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">During our research we often introduce fundamental abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter.</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be like: what is the smaller number of movable parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with a thousand movable parts that gather together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, the pilots-controlled flight devices were able to fly away, which had only two movable parts: a propeller and a tailgate."</seg>
<seg id="435">Unlong we discovered that flies with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically easiest remote device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only a moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no fractures, hinges and cross-ruder, no further actuator or controllers, only a propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"though it is mechanical simple, happens inside life very much, so that it can fly stable and move in space can move over."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to the fly, I have to throw it right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the likelihood to throw it exactly right if all watch me, is low, so I am showing you a video that was filmed yesterday evening."</seg>
<seg id="442">"when the Monospinner is a practice in pleasures, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propane, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why he is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, he receives the poor ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">Moving in space in all directions regardless of which direction he was rotated or even as he rotating.</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propane."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some is adjustable in models, the rest will be learned directly at flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines are to be part of our daily life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine is composed of two separate twin-propellers.</seg>
<seg id="453">This is rotating in the clockwise direction</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other against the clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">If you build them together they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter.</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- a motor or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">"we will demonstrate that now, by making a half airworthy."</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration is investigated synthetic blackness.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expressions."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took trading south-sweet micro-quadcopter -- every single weighs less than a disk bread -- and equip them with localisation technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Every unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine then I would like to get a flying lampshade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types such as us is the salary in the development and the creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">"the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential, the icing on the cake is the icing on the cake."</seg>

<seg id="469">"1,3 billion years ago, circled in a very far distant galaxy two black holes always faster, you transformed so the mass three suns in a tenths in pure energy."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment brighter it brighter than all the stars together in all galaxies of the whole of us known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But their energy did not put them free in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into the space-time frame itself and the universe was exploded in gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"after all, we arrange the events for a time."</seg>
<seg id="476">1,3 billion years ago was a multilingual life on Earth originated.</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, saurs, people and -- God allow us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group decided especially brave -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from Caltech -- to build a huge laser detector from the Caltech - for gravitational-waves, which arise by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">They thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detective LIGO: the laser-interferometer - gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">In the follow-up period the precision of LIGO could be substantially increased as the recognition performance enormously improved.</seg>
<seg id="483">That is why we are now called Advanced LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, LIGO was started for a last test run to clarify some smaller, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on 14 September 2015, only a few days after the start-up of the detector, the gravitational-waves of the two colonised black holes through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>

<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell with my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"all that I had worked for is no longer science fiction! AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been investigating gravitational-waves from black holes and their by observatories like LIGO measurable signals. but what are gravitational-waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a croation in the fabric of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched into one direction and the other is stretched."</seg>
<seg id="495">"to view, faculty in courses for relative theory often lead a really silly dance to dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on 14 September, for example, each of us was stretched by us at the beginning of the waves and stretched out. the elongation of an average human being was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1st Darum, one told the LIGO employees for crazy."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five kilometers long laser detector, and that is absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than a thousandfold of the radius of a nuclear power. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text on gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder LIGO, who hunt for the waves in search of the waves:" the technical difficulties when building such detectors are extensive. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are glowing, and with the support of the public will certainly overcome all obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne has published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to LIGO. Scott maintains that LIGO is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial lifts, the size of your cell phones."</seg>
<seg id="508">This is quite convenient. because so you can make an image or a map of things by view the light around you from several points.</seg>
<seg id="509">For tones it is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to make a picture of things that mean you especially much:"</seg>
<seg id="512">The face of your child approximately.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties such as sound and height, rhythm and volume, in order to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob put them down."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot provide you with simple images from objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by considering changes in the amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least are for LIGO the measured frequencies in the audible field.</seg>
<seg id="521">"therefore, if we convert wavepatterns in sheave, we can hear the all literally."</seg>
<seg id="522">"the gravity to listen, can tell us about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a very long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, not rotating holes, circus just: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">Turn the two body very quickly, you hear the same circus with an additional key change. that sounds like Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu-Wu! "</seg>
<seg id="525">It is a sort of movement that shaped into the waveform.</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on 14 September 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- sounded this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with each 30-facher sunmass, who revolve around as fast as the sticks of your mixers."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: do we think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the dense body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 sonites, revolve each hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces in front of us.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the abiding meaning of LIGO.</seg>
<seg id="533">LIGO opens up a completely new way to study the universe as never before.</seg>
<seg id="534">Along this path we can listen to the space and the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">Much in space may -- virtually or basically -- not visible.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a super-nova, for example. I would like to know why mason stars in Supernovas explode."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. of them we learned a lot about All.</seg>
<seg id="538">"however, the exciting physical processes happen at the core, which is hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never pass through because these opak are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational-waves penetrate iron, as if it were more transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would be crazy to explore the first minutes of the Alls, but we will never see it, because the urine can be obscured by its own light."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the gravitational-waves it should be possible, to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we have never seen before, and of which we do not have any idea of things that we just discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, LIGO found equal in the first attempt of things that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the LIGO project, says to this topic: Me: the kind of stars that bring black holes, like LIGO them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. black holes are so to be the saddlers for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"LIGO permits us a completely different point of view to the events of all, on the emergence of the stars and ultimately, on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to LIGO, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the cosmos and circus des cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be more beautiful than the Big Bang yourself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="554">A while ago I tried an experiment.</seg>

<seg id="557">Would I talk to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Wanted to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, but yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, I feared my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"to keep my fear, speeches, my social fear -- Puff."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a definite yes, which was deeply changed my life, on an unexpected. it started with a question of my youngest."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the youngest, calls for inexplicable reasons all" estimation ""</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she had a waitress from the South.</seg>
<seg id="571">"estimable, I need milk for my beak-street."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"a new way of life in my family. from then on swear I swear to always play with them once you're calling me. no matter what I just do, or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I am not perfect, but I am trying very much."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an astonishing side effect: only recently, I understood that" "yes" "to play with my children my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am author. I think things look like you are going to live.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I creire TV. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make TV, a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">"in this TV season, I am responsible for getting 70 hours of program into the world."</seg>
<seg id="587">"four television programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">"each programme offers hundreds of jobs, which previously did not exist."</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV broadcasts can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode all nine days of four shows, i.e. all nine days 20 million dollars, three broadcasts, three broadcasting, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my television series are running on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"throughout the world, my series is running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million people."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created by myself and not just being produced, so still oblast. I have to find time, really silent, creative time to gather my fans at the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four television series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is still doing this?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore am I a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I do not want to impress you with it.</seg>
<seg id="601">"I say it, because I know what you think, when the word" author "falls."</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say to you, so all of you who are working so hard if you are now working a company, a country or a classroom, take a business, or a household, take me seriously if I am saying, I understand that it is not only going on the computer with a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all perspiration -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work much, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I am in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country from nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it's like I turned troops, as mold I on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"thus, one sees a high tone, lying a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, sounding and maternal, cruelly and sensible. and the best thing is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when working is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the buzz sounds like a busy road, I could go for ever on her."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, if I declare them the sums that I'm writing to writing that writing is joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">Do not understand me wrong that does it.</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began to work with television production, when I began to work and work, build, create and working together, I discovered this thing, this buzz, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The amount is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The buzz is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The buzz is music. the buzz is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The buzz is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a buzz, then you can not strive otherwise than to size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling, not different to aspire to be in size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is what you call the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it is called Genie.</seg>
<seg id="627">Maybe it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I do not know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know that I am not for the failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I will only say to you, I am a Titan, and I know I will not ask it to question."</seg>
<seg id="632">"to make a clear: the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more work there are, the more things more at the same time, the more I am writing history, the more expectations there are."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, not true?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country, which I-monkey, the marathon, the I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzz, the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the buzz. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overlap, exaggerated, burned."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">"now, my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that their mom is a single worker."</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people," My mom will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," Remove, I want to go to Shonda Land. "</seg>
<seg id="646">There are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">You are a baby-Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were hearing."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totaling of the engine is petrified.</seg>
<seg id="650">I did not love my work any more. the engine was off.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked out weekends, no repentance, nothing deleful, a Titan sleeps, does not exist, with full heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no buzz.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four television programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">I was a preview Titan, "</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz was I.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," hal you out, blaming the author-Titan. "</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you're working, you love to be a teacher, a banker to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, you just likes a different and that gives a buzz when you knew the buzz, if the sums up, who is it?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, I can survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then I ask my "southern states" waitress. "</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way out there, too late and she says:" mama, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I will say no wonder when two things become aware of:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to all and secondly, she called me not."</seg>
<seg id="675">It calls nobody more "estimable."</seg>
<seg id="676">When is this happening?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it, if I am Titan and my buzz, and here everything changes before my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," Mom, do you play? "</seg>
<seg id="679">And I say: "yes."</seg>
<seg id="680">This is nothing special.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and her sisters encounter, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book 'Everybody Poops'."</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and in the absence of the summation, I can't make anything except that."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quietly.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country, which I carafe, the marathon I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they don't exist anymore."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and humid kisses, delicate voices, vigilage and the song in which it's going to let go, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Royal". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so little that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Play is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes on and a energy ub comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that is not immediate, but it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The buzz is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"not full volume, hardly there, it's quietly, hardly audible, but it is there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I'd know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let us stay at the cause.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that is all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the buzz, the working environment, the titanium-environment, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself through broadcasts and television hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The totality is no strength and it is not work-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It is dependent on joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The buzz is the river that comes from the joy of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real buzz ignores the pressure of history, the resulting tasks, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sums is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true buzz is the voice of God in my ear, but maybe I whispered with God the wrong words, for which God told me that I am an Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little bit of love, a lot more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this for a fixed rule so I can rid myself as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no other choice. I have no choice but if I want to hear the buzz again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be that simple. I am not good in games, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">"play not just to play, how to work."</seg>
<seg id="722">The truth is hurting;</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">"I always work, because I love it."</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to work at the workplace as at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this entry is painful, for what kind of man prefer to be than home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of that.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we come back in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">We make small dance parties;</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crushing soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"in doing so, I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always ask for my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is o.k.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the sums of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we stopped working with the games?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can do it too! let them always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">"maybe you hold me for naive, for a day-dreaming."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you have probably right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? you are not Rihanna or a muppet Show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes with me, until they want to make something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"they are wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a Marienkins or Keks replaces me.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and speak my teenager for whole 15 minutes with me, I am mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more requires not."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can bring about 15 minutes a piece, even at a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes on the walk!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children of praying."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my wellbeing, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is considered to have the buzz to have a place for its soul peace."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it is not about playing with their own children. it is about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself in the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what to do good.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out it and keep it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I am not perfect in it. I smoked and I siege. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"want to play?" "just for everything I have given up, when I got my first TV show, when I got a Titan in the training, when I wanted to excel myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">"15 minutes at the piece, why not full 15 minutes treat yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The buzz came back in my spare time. the buzz seems to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Work does not work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months it opens a door, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office. I hear a familiar melody, it fills me and my soul. it redirects me to new ideas. I use it into full and love my work."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I do not love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I do not need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">I am not the buzz, the sums is not me... no more. "</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is now my buzz.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The sums of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the amount of labour is part of me, but just a part. and I am so grateful."</seg>
<seg id="778">"I snap that I am a Titan, and I have never seen a Titan, the trip to Jerusalem."</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functional. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better work I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country, which I-monkey, the marathon, I run, the canvases, the high sound, the buzz, the sum, the real buzz: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this sums, the more this unusual, infant, naked and new feeling of life in me wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this sums, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am author. I think things out, I awake you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live its dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">For a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to do less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thanks nice.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am neuroscid.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a serious stroke, or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon, it is very frustrating that the brain, as opposed to other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, heavy disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is the reason why I have functional neurosurgery.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurologist?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nervous functions through various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"surely they have heard of one of the most famous, the" Tiefenhirnstimulation. "in doing so, one can influence a electrode deep inside the brain to influence the circuit boards of neurons so that the neurological function has improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It truly is an amazing technology. she has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease that suffered severe pain and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, Neuromodulation does not mean Neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the recovery of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">In my opinion we approach this dream.</seg>
<seg id="809">I want to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">With some help the brain can help themselves.</seg>
<seg id="811">History started 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At the time I was leading waiter-doctor and worked day and night in the emergency.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I catered patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that in skull-brain-traumas the brain is floating and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to diminish the skull of skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">"to do this, one sometimes has to remove a part of cribed brains."</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing the cribed brains, we decided to analyze the brain mass by Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, an biologist, the brain's mass."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to grow cells from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to leave cells from a tissue, comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you need to find the right diet, temperature, moisture and the environments to flourish it."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it managed Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">That he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">This was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">Perhaps you still know from the Biology lesson that stem cells are unripe cells that can turn into each cell type of the organism.</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain clay in the OP.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells were very different.</seg>
<seg id="835">"slowly and after a couple of weeks, they died even."</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but looked different."</seg>
<seg id="837">"we needed long, in order to understand how they came."</seg>
<seg id="838">They come from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells hot doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our Grand duster cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">You play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they ensure the shifting of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they are taking part in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injury."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so safe.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- by these cells we received our stem cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that allows brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">This we had to prove.</seg>
<seg id="851">"so, we decided to develop an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted a piece of brain out of the non-language area and then see the cells just as cultivate Jean-François did</seg>
<seg id="853">"and subsequently, mark them colorfully, to be able to follow them in the brain."</seg>
<seg id="854">In the last step we implated them at the depositor of the same individual.</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologist Transplantation -- Autoptation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions were: what happens when we reproduce these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we implant the same cells into brainward brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario, we implanted the cells in a healthy brain, and we observed that after a couple of weeks they had completely disappeared, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not used there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we gave an injury to and implanted exactly the same cells and now the cells were preserved -- they grew up to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells which were implanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"evidence to show they are these little points. these are the cells we left in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Can these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain lesion?</seg>
<seg id="865">"so, we prepared monkeys with a manual conception."</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take feed pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">This they did very well.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they had achieved a stable skill level, we last in the motoric Cortex the Handlerene range."</seg>
<seg id="869">"thereupon, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move her hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen to men, they recover spontaneously up to a certain degree, just as after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover by means of vivid brain mechanisms. they are recuperate to a certain degree, just like the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous recovery, we implated his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left, they see the monkeys that recovered spontaneously."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as accurate and not as fast as possible.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now, as we reproduce the cells, the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that was also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since that time we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze it and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example with Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream still is to implate them with men.</seg>
<seg id="882">"I really hope that I can show you soon, how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself."</seg>
<seg id="883">Many thanks.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I am sure that right now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who may need. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on people."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill about two kilograms papers and forms to go through these kinds of studies.</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes to come to hospital, and that therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it is hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to perform this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">"it takes a long time to select patients, perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment."</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply this to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">"first, one has to really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone."</seg>
<seg id="898">BG: and that it is safe. JB: of course.</seg>
<seg id="899">BG: Jocelyne thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">"we in the West make a big mistake, they as a matter of course to consider."</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant, which is in reality but as inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable truths.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great indulitators in Beijing have doubtlessly proved that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely non-democratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy dwindles with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I presented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was clear to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup -- our elections -- not to influence the austerity programs that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at this moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my old friends, told me that democracy would change when they change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you to believe in together with me to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup believe that we could save democracy, but that we need a perceptible and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are painted, our future bleak, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"to the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction, which is currently threatened our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize it as the mountain mountain, who casts its long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt hill,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize its Gemini.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which is to be too anxious to invest it there where it would be productive and income to carry with whom you could carry the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity is urgently needed, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3.4 trillion dollars were invested in the US, in England and in the euro zone, in all the wealth of producing goods, such as industrial plants, machines, office buildings, schools, roads, smooth, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"3.4 trillion dollars a lot of money, until you compares it with the 5.1 trillion dollars that were around the same time in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing did, except the stock exchange and the real estate prices uplift."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debts and unproductive capital form the twin summit, which does not conform to the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnating wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54 year-olds in the US, Japan and Europe are unemployed, and therefore a low-pan growth, which could not invest in which they do not invest. just like Oedipus father, who from fear, the prophecies of Orakels could be true that his son would kill him if he grows,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unwanted to bring about circumstances that cause oils to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unveiled funds. all the unproductive capital should be used to enhance our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance all of the technologies," green "technologies that are crucial to rescue the Earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">I believe. but before we continue: what do we mean under democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristoteles defined democracy as the social form in which the Free and the poor are controlling the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">The Athenian democracy made of course too many --</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to make the significance of the athic democracy on account of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decision of the Athenian democracy was and is, that they have the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gives them the right to political codetermination with equal consistency in questions of the state bellows."</seg>
<seg id="935">The athic democracy has not held long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines very bright, it is also quickly burned."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-liberal democracies have not left its roots in the ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy concentrated on the free citizens and the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which was ultimately a statute for mistress."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy was only possible when a complete separation of politics and economy is possible, and the democratic process has been confined to politics while the economy -- so the world of corporations -- a democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in our present democracies has been occurring since the time, in which this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two instead of the economy gradually hiked the politics and escapes them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wonder why the politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because these days can be found today in the government, and nonetheless not in power, because the power of politics is emigrated to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hate with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"when you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that, so sustainably the animals, of which it nourishes, decimated that at the end they are hungry."</seg>
<seg id="947">"it is similar to the economy that the politics emerged as far as the economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods will be devaluated, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of the corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful of capitalism the" demos ", the higher the twin summit, and the greater the extravagance of human labour power and the welfare of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"when this is true, it is obvious that we must bring the politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "retains control, as in the ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, the women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">This is not a new idea by the way.</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had this idea 100 years ago and it wasn't anything but good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the teaching from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor can only regain a status like in the ancient Athens, without creating new types of brutality and extravagance."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: creating the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing Niedriglowing occupied by automating and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem here is, so long economy and politics are separate areas, automation and automation summit are higher, the extravagance, and social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we have to reconstruct the economy and reunite the areas of business and politics and to ensure that we will develop the reunified field, otherwise we end up in an abnormal surveillance hyperautocracy that may appear the film" "matrix" "as a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is not whether capitalism has the technical achievements that he has brought forth, will survive --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the most interesting question is whether capitalism is solved through a dystopia, similar to the" matrix "," in which machines serve the human beings, and put their energy into the study of the universe, or into a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians "Agora," in long talks the meaning of life. "</seg>
<seg id="959">I believe we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it happen, how could it look, this" star Trek "- utopia rather than the" matrix "-similar dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows from a working place to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is currently working -- is the property of those who currently work in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then, all income from capital and from redeemed and the concept of wage work is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the companies, who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but no exchange between capital and labour, do not have large gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please note that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency, issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest Emerging Markets], in the interest of the whole of humankind."</seg>
<seg id="966">"continue to be traded that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "" -- and each government pays the sum, which corresponds to the trade deficit or the merchant account of the country, into a common fund. "</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment resources are scarce."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 had proposed.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time they had not had the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we, particularly against the background of a unified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world that I describe you is at the same time liberating, in which they preferred to eat privileged people, and Marxist because it is buried the separation of capital and labour in the dustbin of history, and keynesianically, global keynesianically."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thanks.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself in your biography itself as libertarian Marxists.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I said precisely, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and business is... do we do that, technological development will generate such a massive decline of overall economic demand that Larry Summer's" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely wirh."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: actually, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you are not wirr, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein that said this. BG: in your talk you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday evening at dinner of the speakers, you said clearly what you think of the West's point of view."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a large measure of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the semblance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I told in my presentation, we have limited democracy on politics, while the area where most of them play, -- the area of economy -- a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some respects, if I must say that provocative, China today resembles the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- do you remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- this is an error.</seg>
<seg id="996">Liberalism and Liberals such as John Stuart Mill --</seg>
<seg id="997">"he was very skeptical, which concerns the democratic development."</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is similar to the development that we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"now, China has to pretend to do what the West has done itself in the 19th century, smells amazing to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listener is curious about your experiences as a finance minister in Greece's start of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I sensed that this is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later on the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, out of personal view, and very disappointing, because we had the opportunity to make a new beginning with the Eurozone"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"namely, to say goodbye to self-sufficiency, and the persistent denial made that a massive decay goes through the eurozone and continues to massively threaten the development of the whole of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal was, who revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, it is right to do it. unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, continue to vote the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what comes.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries to get an economic system that is not viable, by political will and authoritarianism in life, you may perhaps delay a while, but when change occurs, it happens abrupt and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes are you looking ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone does not have a future if we do not change its construction.</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: have you made any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: anyone who looks back -- seriousness...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister, or any Minister there who has been in office after 6 months, especially in such a tense situation, he did not make a mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"of course, I made mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the request for an extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">"I believed that there was an honest interest in the donor, finding a common solution."</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They just wanted to bring our government to case only because they didn't want to deal with the resisations caused by the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to concede that they have been catastrophic programme in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">None of the troika creditors that have imposed on this policy: "this was a colossal error.</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive interference of the conversations, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">My criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone is coming from someone who lives and loves.</seg>
<seg id="1030">My biggest fear is that the Eurozone does not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if it does not survive, the acquitted forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1032">"this will not be catastrophic consequences for Europe alone, but for the entire global economy."</seg>
<seg id="1033">We are probably the strongest economy in the world.</seg>
<seg id="1034">"when we overshadowing the path of a post-modern 1930, after which it appears to me, it will also be detrimental to the future of Europeans as well as the non-Europeans."</seg>
<seg id="1035">BG: we hope that you are wrong in this point.</seg>
<seg id="1036">"Yanis, thank you for you at TED."</seg>
<seg id="1037">YV: thanks.</seg>
<seg id="1038">"from Roy Price most never heard, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19 April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for too many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is premier at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV-production company of Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has a refreshment and describes on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. "</seg>
<seg id="1044">"Roy has a very important job, because he is responsible for showing the shows and the content showing the Amazon."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV series that Roy cannot select any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of that corner."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDb website. the valuation proceeds from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this review.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, it is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" The Wire "-- all the shows, addictive, where after you looked a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what goes off at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting into the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to offer" Toddlers and Tiaras "." "</seg>
<seg id="1056">"it makes more thought about the average yield, the average TV -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply amaze."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present and of course it is also the first time that Amazon is doing something, therefore Roy Price does not want to risk."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he keeps a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selected by an evaluation of eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and puts them online, where they can look at any free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon are out in vain things, you can still fall right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators can look at these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know they are observed when looking at this shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, what parts you are skipped and looks again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide with these data to decide which show they should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and from this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a Sitcom by four Republican US Senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">You made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does someone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many of them can remember this show because it was not so good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is only an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- since the average of this curve 7,4 is and Alpha House slows with 7,5 -- that is something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time at another company, another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy is he always looking for finding it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does something different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of holding a competition, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix audience, thus the reviews that they give the shows, their course, what shows they like etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then use this data to find out these little details about the viewer: what shows they like, what producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they went a wagon and decided not to make a Sitcom for four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards "." Netflix has a hit with it, at least for the first two seasons. "</seg>
<seg id="1079">"house of Cards" gets a 9,1 review on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go. "</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data to each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because the logic has somehow been that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"when you collect millions of data, for a decision that you meet, then you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">One has 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">You are optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the mindete, what you can expect is good television, or?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"when data analysis does not work so, this is a little startling because we are living in a time when we hold more and more statistics in order to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does someone here know the company Multi-Health System?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health System is a software company and I hope that nobody in this room will ever come in touch with this software. come in touch, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison here in the USA and ask for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine if a dismissal is made or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">Just like at Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad will be decided whether a person will be good or bad.</seg>
<seg id="1095">"medium-sized television, 22 minutes, that can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">"not always, the best results are generated. that's not because a company like multi-health system does not know how to use data."</seg>
<seg id="1098">Also the data of the most experienced companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"2009, Google announced that through data analysis outbreaks of flu, the terrible way can be predicted - through data analysis of the Google research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully well and was a big news release. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly no longer worked,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of the most experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data flows in decisions of life - in the workplace, in enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">"so, we prefer to make sure that data are helpful."</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know lots of difficulties with data. I work in computer-assisted genetics -- an area where some very smart people unimaginable to use many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or developing a drug. over the years I have recognised some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, breaking this problem into its parts so that you can analyze the parts thereof; as a broad set you set the parts again to write a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and get together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help create a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to add the parts again and then come to a resolution.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool to do this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something that is good in which the brain is good, it is parts and pieces to get together again, even if the information is incomplete, especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think I was Netflix so successful because they used data and minds where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use the data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision, how to take all these parts, put together again and make it a show like" House of Cards "," which did not stand in the data. "</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they went a great personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon on the other hand did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used the data to control all their decisions, first as they had to have TV ideas, then as they chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">"it was a safe decision, because they could always say:" this will tell us the dates. "</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe that things are going wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just a tool and not to forget that this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you are becoming...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it is also called" Magic 8 Ball, "it is amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no-question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." most probably "-- right here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it later with a technic.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I met some decisions in my life, whereby I should have heard in retrospect on the ball."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much outfolded, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the layout.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"perhaps the ball is classy and classy and cluttering. ultimately, it is up to us to make decisions if we want something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging message, that in spite of the large amount of data still pays, make decisions to be an expert in what you do, and risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, there is not the data, but the risks associated with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thanks nice.</seg>
