Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards to change your sight on the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt is where young people will encounter .
&quot; a gr@@ aci@@ elle , which is now du@@ g for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel . &quot;
small gar@@ den@@ ers provide for the cause of farmers .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it &apos;s nervous when landing cards are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
&quot; that knows everyone who had already had an upright position , because the car Nav@@ i took place instead of a circum@@ ring road a green meadow . &quot;
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of ge@@ op@@ ort@@ as Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but just therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online cards .
&quot; it becomes clear , how cities and churches have changed in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Merk@@ ur since the 19th century . &quot;
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a sp@@ lat@@ tered canvas that one does not recognize as such .
&quot; the large transfer card have been incorporated for cities and municipalities for detailed maps , so @-@ called urine sheets . &quot;
these were created in accordance with the Bay@@ er@@ isches Committee management between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and ski@@ pping of the first measurement of Bay@@ erns .
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
French army carriers occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II war .
Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a top@@ ographic recording of Bay@@ erns - of course for military purposes .
&quot; finally , when the French troops went off with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from 9 February 18@@ 01 : there were today &apos;s neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Kur@@ für@@ st Max IV . Joseph was driving forward the project moving forward , established the &quot; &quot; top@@ ographical Bureau &quot; &quot; - and thus the Bay@@ erische surve@@ ying administration . &quot;
the focal sheet for Munich comes from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others to be found on the Bay@@ erische Staats@@ bibliothek .
the comparison morning / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive .
the city has expanded throughout all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example of this is sub@@ ver@@ d@@ ling , which appears in the map of 18@@ 56 rather isolated . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was transferred 21 years after the creation of the map , so 1877 , as a Munich city district . &quot;
&quot; today , Sub@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of shelter concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the insurrection of Bav@@ arian peasants against Austria 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the West@@ park is , you can see nothing but fields - at first glance : at the Hin@@ der zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand@@ writing numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; jungle &quot; &quot; from which the base tax was derived . &quot;
small plots from there are no farmers no longer - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot;
a large green area is situated north of the sub@@ ver@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , since 18@@ 10 loc@@ ales of the October Revolution , was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
on the other side of the Is@@ ar the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine .
&quot; in the judgment sheet , one reads in the area of today &apos;s district A@@ u @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen not only reads the street name &quot; &quot; Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or of the hill &quot; &quot; On the air &quot; &quot; but also in big letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ strasse , one once pushed people with madness . &quot;
there was 18@@ 58 / 59 the Mün@@ chner district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt on the Au@@ er Lü@@ nen . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard from Gu@@ dden took up the institution - that psychiat@@ rist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig &apos;s II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and for example , the chains of so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the in@@ mates , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum of Hai@@ d@@ hausen who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; initially , for 280 patients had been a first place , later it was expanded to 500 sites . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the county @-@ pen@@ it@@ ator in hair 1905 . &quot;
&quot; there has been the Is@@ ar @-@ A@@ MP@@ ER @-@ Klin@@ gen@@ um Munich @-@ East , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ry in Germany . &quot;
on the site of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt now meet young people in Munich &apos;s Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a teen@@ ager with training courses .
West is the football ground of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of the buildings in the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children @-@ house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bosco &quot; &quot; was built in an architectural approach to the country of origin of the Ir@@ ren@@ ia , which had been destroyed during the Second World War in Bom@@ ben@@ an@@ attacked . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was in 18@@ 56 as &quot; main square &quot; , &quot; the department name was called &quot; &quot; Pur@@ inger G@@ asse &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the bombs from the Al@@ lies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ en@@ hof .
&quot; the English institute , small business houses and a pit @-@ chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Mari@@ en@@ hof , where these days work the pre @-@ bite and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ bite for the second S @-@ Bahn . &quot;
&quot; with the sli@@ der , the old Munich map will be compared to the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ en@@ hof . &quot;
civil Rights group released travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the national association for the promotion of coloured colored has issued a warning for colored people that travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will take place until 28 August 2017 , calls for af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , since a number of frag@@ mented , racial @-@ based pre @-@ based cases occur in the whole state and here , it is said in the opinion of the group . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder to win Dis@@ crimin@@ ation , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state , the dis@@ proportionate to minorities , prompted the group to recover the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
&quot; they have violations of civil rights , people happen . &quot;
&quot; they are kept because of their skin colour , they will be assembled or killed , &quot; &quot; said the President of Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , Rod Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such an incidence that we have not yet heard .
it is the first such warning issued by the organisation for a state in the United States .
&quot; the Group quoted as rac@@ ist for@@ ks against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after having no gasoline on the country had no gasoline , and taken by the police of Mis@@ sour@@ i , being accused of being accused of any crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recently published report by Mis@@ sour@@ i , in which black drivers in the state will be 75 per cent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot;
people need to be prepared to bring Cau@@ tion money or to know relatives that they travel through the state .
Mis@@ sour@@ i posted 100 hate @-@ hate in 2015 after the latest figures from the hate @-@ hate report of the F@@ BI which entered the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .
the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil liberties union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , having passed the states of immigration law , the local criminal law enforcement authorities to commit to people because of immigration law will contribute to further ag@@ gra@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; travel aler@@ ts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately , stakeholders have been using the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the Wei@@ ren@@ aun@@ ching project is elementary
the fishing bacher Wei@@ de@@ ench@@ n project is a project project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U Par@@ liam@@ entary Party Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have created an image on site .
in the castle grab@@ en@@ hof the Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann family met representatives of the fis@@ her CD@@ U local associations with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; Markus Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann initially granted insights into his farm , in which he is located 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 milk @-@ cows and as many kittens and housed in five apartments holiday homes . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; black @-@ milk &quot; &quot; is for him the alternative mark@@ eter for the milk of his cows , so Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este only occurs region@@ ally .
&quot; since he is also the BL@@ H@@ V @-@ Chairman of Men@@ bach , he called the &quot; &quot; elementary project &quot; &quot; as &quot; elementary &quot; . &quot; &quot;
I can not profit@@ ably manage on such steep areas .
&quot; the green area for much work , a lot must be edited using the motor sense . &quot;
&quot; we have here to fight with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
in 2003 he took over the el@@ eventh operation and cultivated these without chemical plant protection and fertili@@ zers even if they do not lead bio @-@ operation .
&quot; for mayor , Thomas Schneider was clear : &quot; &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the turn@@ around project , and is pleased with the leader . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hect@@ are , the farmers need to be supported . &quot;
&quot; I hope , so that the for@@ estation of the areas could be gone up for quite a while . &quot;
&quot; the biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and make thought about how they continue to put their business , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
farmers are often in criticism because of their funding
&quot; over the course of the course of the settlement , 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants . &quot;
the disclosure area is thus 40 hectares which can not be affor@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 .
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of which was funded over Le@@ aders , a quarter performed the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers love 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers past@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the longevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; stated Sch@@ wen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and women it does not go . &quot;
&quot; for Peter white stood firm , &quot; &quot; Here are the best food produced . &quot;
the Land@@ scap@@ es of Land@@ scap@@ es ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state promotion of women @-@ fence .
the goal is the En@@ ten@@ ure of the Black @-@ alds .
the requirement is the presence of one of the L@@ PR drawn conveyor belts .
&quot; in addition , the in@@ fer@@ ous surface may not be in@@ dur@@ able ( Hang@@ outs over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the fisher@@ y Wei@@ ren@@ aun@@ t project 2018 , the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots , which would like to build up to 16 kilometers fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump takes the Statue of Liberty
the safest sign of a regime switch is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos place in Bagh@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tr@@ ump regime , didn &apos;t know what he did when he took a symbolic A@@ xt in a h@@ it@@ ent argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta by CN@@ N about the proposals of the President to the dras@@ tic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ es would have denied him if he had done it .
&quot; but he laid their significance , and in particular the meaning that it was written , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta described : &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a full thing about story , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tened the world . &quot;
the poem which you relate to which later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is proper to properly , but as he formed it himself , it is not really about story . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : &quot; thy ti@@ sts , your poor , and your op@@ pressive masses who cra@@ ve to breathe free , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable waste &quot; was better seen on our screens .
&quot; Miller did not get involved in literary criticism , making it clear that these people are not welcome in Tr@@ umps . &quot;
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural examination : it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America .
Lazarus and her friends who put themselves to place their words on their death on the base - knew very well that she has accomplished a high @-@ political action .
the sculpture should show links between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presented the feminine image of freedom in an un@@ used classical exposition .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstr@@ ac@@ tly - she has received a voice .
and she gives himself a completely different name : mother of ex@@ iles .
the connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed , people wanted to change from the right wings for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great cry of Rus@@ h Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is one , but rather an early neo @-@ conservative that puts the American flame into the um@@ med world : &quot; lady Liberty is proceeding . &quot;
she is said to carry the tor@@ ch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .
the tor@@ ch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States .
quite unusual is Lim@@ bau@@ gh here on a bit pushed .
the significance of the statue is completely and at all a matter of point of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative effect of Lazarus consisted in it , as they see from the exhaustive , miserable , but hope@@ ful men after lengthy and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . &quot;
&quot; it is in the tru@@ est sense of seeing the world from the perspective of men to look for refuge , and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
their statue talks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they have to hear .
&quot; and that is of course not the perspective , the Miller and Tr@@ ump will ever wish to recognise . &quot;
&quot; her tor@@ ch should not illumin@@ ate the way , but the hatred , who is their only source of power . &quot;
world championship 2017 : N@@ eil Black and inherited Scottish members of the UK
E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle remembers a time when only two bottles were part of the UK team .
&quot; the performance director of the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ le@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member of the World Cup camp will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of sho@@ ot@@ tic athletes selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Black believes that in Scotland some special things developed , and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out , &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did .
the Scottish athletes think that something has to do with what they did .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they did .
and also with the type on the corner .
whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilli@@ antly . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals @-@ cont@@ enders , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart - which compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5.000 m line , while E@@ ili@@ ie Do@@ yle was elected by the team for team@@ leader . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ ie is fairly modest , &quot;
&quot; their captain &apos;s speech was amazing , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or train , they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feel that E@@ ili@@ ie was quite natural , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Commonwealth of Silver Med@@ al wins , which is in the fifth World Championship in the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 sc@@ ots are in the British team . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s best total on athletes at the World Championship has been seven in 1983 and 2015 .
the mid@@ stretch @-@ wing@@ ed Mu@@ ir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 square and the 5,000 m . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , the 1.500 m walks , is another Scot@@ sman that was included in the British team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ yle remembered her first world Championships , when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ nell was . &quot;
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; on the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots do not only belong to the team , but in some cases also with the medals and the Fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the speciality is to be team captain in that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it &apos;s been a great honor to know , but to know that my team @-@ mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
&quot; obviously , I am very proud of all the vill@@ i that belong to the team . &quot;
it only shows how far we came .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain for him ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home World Championship .
&quot; it is therefore really important to put on this way support and benefit , we are back in the Olympiastadion . &quot;
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it &apos;s just going to be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking critics via Facebook : filling yourself not a public office if you can &apos;t wear the local voters .
the Father of our country knew something of bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles . &quot;
he im@@ pe@@ ed in criticism .
but he did not put his critics to silence .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 Washington said , &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led to the sheep to the slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to the Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who has to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil liberties set him therefore at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the St@@ ab of the Govern@@ ors left the law@@ suit as Fri@@ vo@@ l , and the online comment was full of a counter@@ reaction with &quot; &quot; Na , &quot; &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it is only Facebook , &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a guy like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state who is ast@@ ounding .
he has the highest highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles .
he was also very skill@@ ful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect to his voters and to deb@@ ating his ha@@ ired head to chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of individuals who come to the site of the Govern@@ ors - which is a public forum that is officially designated and by employees who are paid with public taxes - need@@ less and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans Spre@@ cher@@ in Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse the actions of the Govern@@ ors and argued that the block@@ age of comments is nothing more than a moderation . &quot;
&quot; but it is too simple to use the image of tro@@ lls or sp@@ amm@@ ing or h@@ water @-@ filled people , which reson@@ ate online the whi@@ p . &quot;
the mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders , a teacher , an entrepren@@ eur and a pastor , no tro@@ lls . &quot;
they all said that their comments were respectful and thou@@ ght@@ fully and not prof@@ ane .
the pastor cruci@@ fied the Bible in his post and called to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; attorney Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani by Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not h@@ itting , but she asked to break down . &quot;
&quot; I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other current news , she wrote in the commentary area of the message &quot; &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea if a number of people take place at the same subject , then they are regarded by some more so @-@ so @-@ called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the employees of the Govern@@ ors signed as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attacks &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; inter@@ ce@@ de &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic , or deleted a negative comment . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot cleaner as in previous time , if you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical lad@@ ders and teach demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but this is exactly what happens .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tr@@ ump is compl@@ ained about Twitter @-@ users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors County is the last A@@ mend@@ ment , according to the US District Apostle James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they named a vot@@ er on their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Be@@ fore ( R ) received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U because of his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so hard .
&quot; at present , Washington &apos;s time had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multip@@ ly between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous brie@@ fing proposed to his leadership . &quot;
and even at that time Washington was anonymous .
&quot; the people who used pseudon@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critici@@ zed his position on the Treaty of Am@@ ity , the trade and the shipping sector with Britain , have accumulated his ministry , according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Pap@@ ers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them sil@@ enced .
&quot; freedom of expression , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes on domestic comfort at the Renaissance club
former Europeans No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hope for the next three days in domestic comfort when the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25 issue of Scottish Senior Open .
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who led last year next year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field links to the final , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , and acts as a tournament message on behalf of the club &apos;s green@@ ders and CE@@ Os Jerry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from his best , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jerry has made a great job when he put this place .
he is an eager pro@@ pon@@ ent of this game and is proud of his performance here .
&quot; this is a great showcase for this course . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the English E@@ ales will be delighted to defend a championship for the first time , although he won in his 32 @-@ year career in both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; this really feels special , &quot; said the player used in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I did not defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dura Open , as it was in the year after I had won them out of the program . &quot;
back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories from last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on , last year to win . &quot;
it was a really special time and one we always appreciated .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year , returns to the promotion of the home country . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish show since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a little bit more when you play at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am glad how far it has gone . &quot;
&quot; with the trio at the field the former Masters @-@ winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and the Senior Major champi@@ ons Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; Or@@ r and the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belong to the six pi@@ cks in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ All@@ ister , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
the entrance is free of charge . the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passengers and £ 10 per car with two or more in@@ mates .
all proceeds will go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pulmon@@ ary deaths by passive smoke
fewer people have died in the past two decades due to pas@@ sports in lung cancer .
&quot; to this result , scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( UK@@ E ) come in a study . &quot;
&quot; according to our estimates a year 16@@ 7 lungs are due to passive exposure to passive si@@ vity , &quot; said Doc@@ tor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drawn an own study on this subject from 1994 . &quot;
at that time there was still 400 lung cancer @-@ sto@@ des@@ ks due to pas@@ si@@ pping a year in Germany .
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
home@@ use turned out to be very complex
&quot; the construction work in the Vill@@ inger road are in full swing and &quot; &quot; are quite some time &quot; , &quot; thus the leader of the building Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic degrees , the situation is more complex than suspected as in the underground much @-@ amounts , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders the construction , represents a big problem for the construction tr@@ up@@ p of the company St@@ ump@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of the motor@@ ists in front of red traffic lights and bul@@ locks is already enormous , &quot; Hein@@ ze reports . &quot;
the road is locked and only the line bus@@ buses are eligible for travel .
Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Marvin Ko@@ qu@@ z and Tim Ko@@ cancelled from the company St@@ ump@@ p have been busy with works on the bridge for weeks . &quot;

poverty and death in the Indones@@ ian Gold@@ land
if Bar@@ dina De@@ ge@@ i bo@@ il the dinner she uses no st@@ ov@@ et@@ op .
they even rarely use a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ iment in the Indones@@ ian province of Pap@@ ua , the house@@ wife usually den@@ otes a sweet potato - locally as &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the hung@@ arian tu@@ ber is taken with di@@ lig@@ ently , im@@ migr@@ ated hands and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay , it has no furniture - where they also perform their daily work , e.g. clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bu@@ cket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , you were not assigned no fields . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , it can be too dangerous to work : most village men are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are the soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around after 17 o &apos;clock in the village , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua , a former Dutch colony which was taken in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,0@@ 26 elder members should vote in front of the occupation forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement that advocates the independence against the Dutch rule , turned to quickly against the government of Jak@@ arta , which maintains its control over the region and foreign journalists or jurisdictions of it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 the province was officially distributed in Pap@@ ua and West Pap@@ ua , whereby the independent part Pap@@ ua New Guinea was involved in the eastern part of the island . &quot;
En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is as remote as it is ö@@ de . the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital of Jay@@ u@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning @-@ hour drive with the car rental .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city with approximately 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses that are surrounded by bam@@ boo ene , and out of shaft com@@ partments which were converted by r@@ ust in various yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , wei@@ ghted because journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans a God named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , and points to her lively , handmade tur@@ ban , her dark@@ er shirt and her bright rock . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had leaves to our bodies . &quot;
Pap@@ ua is In@@ don@@ esi@@ ally poor province where 28 % of men live under the poverty line and some of the worst childhood and liter@@ acy rates in Asia .
but it is also In@@ don@@ esi@@ ens Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by the Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located just 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
in 2015 there has been Free@@ port in value of 3.@@ 1 billion US dollar gold and copper alone .
Pap@@ ua has more than wooden resources valued by valued 78 billion US dollars .
&quot; however , this riches are however a source of misery for the Pap@@ ua which make sure that In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans em@@ powered military a er@@ sti@@ ck@@ able presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port local military and units paid between 1998 and 2004 to nearly 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy is endangered these golden go@@ ose and are dealt with grace .
&quot; according to statements by activists , more than 500,000 Pap@@ ua have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed since 1969 by the Indones@@ ian military . &quot;
mass@@ acres in Pap@@ u@@ as tribal communities in 1970 @-@ 11 years were committed to genocide in accordance with the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
in the region the Indones@@ ian police had more than 3.@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year .
&quot; we &quot; &quot; lost all &quot; &quot; in a report of the Arch@@ diocese Bris@@ bane taken from the year 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ legal instructions and torture , rape and electro@@ des are particularly popular according to another report - and brutal rainf@@ all demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since each week does happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; bol@@ ts have reinforced , because Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of settlers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is about 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes , as Muslim econom@@ ists come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese waiting cant@@ ines are selling baked chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut . &quot;
local people are fighting for spending here .
&quot; the migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than local Pap@@ ua , &quot; explains A@@ beth You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ local , who moved to work in the province capital of Jay@@ u@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has tasted the native Pap@@ ua , the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the Women &#93; by Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; the Indones@@ ian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , known in the folk and as Jok@@ ow@@ i , spoke during his election campaign in 2014 to address inequalities and violations of violations in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter 27 of the 29 districts of Pap@@ ua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Pap@@ ua has changed little , and today the locals feel che@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ ow@@ i , with the anticip@@ ation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice is restored , &quot; &quot; You said . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is inauguration in October . &quot;
on 7 December 2014 a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas car@@ ols in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , as two Indones@@ ian soldiers on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frightened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers took off her tone and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers , who had drunk , and smote the group with their gun , they said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , the 16 @-@ year Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ ei@@ mo , was so hard be@@ aten that he fell into a coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building was put on fire at the nearby Government Commission and escal@@ ate things the next day .
&quot; approximately 1,000 young Pap@@ ua men , women and children gathered together on a football ground in front of the local police station and the military commander to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hun@@ ted and carried the Wa@@ ita @-@ dance - in the circle continuously and a bird @-@ like im@@ it@@ ating - by Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago @-@ trunk .
some prot@@ esters began to@@ wing stones at police and military post .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over a internal radio : &quot; if the masses do more than three times , shoot them dead , &quot; it is in an official document of TI@@ ME , which was not released by the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ emi@@ as Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the dro@@ pping danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned , I was suddenly shot into my lin@@ kes wr@@ ist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was over@@ crowded , many shots were fired , he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his c@@ ousin , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran@@ ged to him and examined his body to make sure he was &quot; , &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who carries only a name the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I have kis@@ sed it .
&quot; the editor @-@ spec@@ tor of the Pap@@ ua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , said Re@@ por@@ tees , that his officers must only &quot; secure their station &quot; because they are attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said the speaker of the Pap@@ ua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; fil@@ tered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks of Jok@@ ow@@ i in Com@@ ap@@ ura gave a passionate talk , in which he sympath@@ ies for the families of victims and s@@ wor@@ e to address the historic abnorm@@ alities in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case immediately resolved , so that in the future it will no longer happen &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; safety Minister Wir@@ anto said in October 2016 , that he will judge an extra @-@ judicial mechanism for the consideration of historical violations of human rights . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries have been performed long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s years .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must go through , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then hosts made a retreat , when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta , and said he has no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is governed by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; the landlord who has been indicted for crimes against humanity because of &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , &quot; said that 11 cases of human rights ab@@ uses in Pap@@ ua were already attached , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims were contrary to such alleg@@ ations with gri@@ mm@@ ers .
&quot; I was interviewed during the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear later .
&quot; I have fear , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid to be arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the opinion that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was be@@ aten by the military after he was helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I was buried the cor@@ p@@ ses , the military sought after me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ies have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indones@@ ian police on villagers in the Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood D@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between the village inhabitants and the manager of a B@@ auf@@ ir@@ ma who refused to bring a unconscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were wounded , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drunk in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
reduced villagers prot@@ ested before the company &apos;s office .
&quot; the police said that the villagers prot@@ ru@@ ed stones on officers , who re@@ acted to de@@ hum@@ ming warning . &quot;
but locals say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indones@@ ian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began to shoot a lot and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witness as the latter were delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament called to hold the officers to account and to withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of police in the area .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ bu@@ zz@@ lement for the Indones@@ ian government .
&quot; the lack of sensu@@ ous development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , which live in the green high@@ lands of Pap@@ ua . &quot;
&quot; many adher@@ ed to the &quot; &quot; Free Pap@@ ua Movement &quot; &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the re@@ bel army , claimed to defend the rights of Pap@@ ua by entering spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indones@@ ian soldiers . &quot;
some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai including Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya .
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitrary in custody , under the pretext of &quot; securing the national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some do never dive again .
&quot; among the people of Pap@@ ua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place &quot; . &quot; &quot;
poverty strengthens the dissatisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just out of reach .
the people here are building everything they eat : in particular Not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potato .
they retain most of the crops for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indones@@ ian R@@ up@@ ies ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic inequalities between the native Pap@@ ua and the new migrants have grown , since the opening of new routes to the airport Nab@@ ire in larger numbers have arrived . &quot;
&quot; the few jobs , which there are in the region , usually go to the better educated and wealthy migrants . &quot;
Pap@@ ua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own business competitive .
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
insulation keeps the eyes of the world far from Pap@@ ua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions and coverage remain tense . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ es and Basi@@ lle Long@@ cham@@ p were de@@ ported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Pap@@ ua , although they were given the rare permission to the film . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is campaign , were not realised concerning the restrictions of coverage in order to promote transparency and development , not implemented . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report from In@@ don@@ esi@@ ans in@@ quiet Eastern provinces of Pap@@ ua and West@@ pap@@ ua : visa @-@ denial and a black list , &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indones@@ ian government remains largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six paci@@ f@@ fish states - Ton@@ ga , Nau@@ ru@@ u , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Mar@@ sh@@ all@@ ine and the Sal@@ om@@ onen Islands - the UN Human Rights Council , including the Pan @-@ Human Rights Council , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries historically seen the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indones@@ ian Foreign Ministry of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ atha N@@ asi@@ r pointed out the accus@@ ations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there is free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights incidents . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; as an official delegation from the Netherlands , visited by the Netherlands , under the direction of the human right @-@ ambassador Ke@@ es Van Ba@@ ar , Jay@@ u@@ ura , who visited her silence and aff@@ licted him &quot; We want freedom &quot; , according to a source that also participated in the session but remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia , 2019 , has another presidential election , but the Pap@@ ua say that they are likely to vote no again for wild@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai kis@@ ses , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants that Jok@@ ow@@ i knows that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , in arm@@ our education and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai tells that the Pan@@ i@@ ai folk , like other Pap@@ ua , her voice for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; he must pay back . &quot;
&quot; they do not need money , they just want justice , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and intimi@@ dation led families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ Sch@@ uss@@ ation , the last symbolic act of Des@@ p@@ ite : the body of a victim was buried on a site precisely opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they might never come to justice for them , but at least they will not forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a stric@@ ter head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; skyscr@@ aper from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest living towers of the world in Dubai its pass@@ book and forced hundreds of residents , from the 3@@ 37 meters high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps in only two years by the high @-@ house , which is called by Rand@@ y the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was ev@@ acu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word on the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we stood by the fire alarm and the scri@@ be of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to come from the 50@@ th place to come down , &quot; &quot; told a resident named his name as George An@@ ab , Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; Dub@@ ais Local Auth@@ orities said that the units of fire fight against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 hours GMT ) the fire extingu@@ ished and the building was cool@@ ed off . &quot;
&quot; the government said , it is working on providing accommodation for those affected . &quot;
&quot; the incident can be used for safety of materials , which are used in the outside areas of skyscrapers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch @-@ building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damages from the cl@@ adding , the exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police officers , they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding to the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a meeting in June , in which approximately 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup @-@ Reform : further Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) is presented with his great Davis Cup cou@@ p at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the meeting in Ho Chi Min@@ h City , the for this Sport revolutionary proposal , Davis Cup singles , was not only supported on two winn@@ ings , Hau@@ ch@@ thin did not support the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; the very long , often very long , but also therefore very este@@ emed five @-@ sentence classics remain the tradition of the tradition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3,@@ 54 per cent of the member countries for the reform , the objective of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty has therefore only been scarce . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members are not accepted the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the rated .
&quot; not until the vote has been made , before the proposal before the proposal came to a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only compar@@ atively smaller details : so the fin@@ alists will be in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup in future , in the first round of the host law . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the costs of the organizer , the requirements in training courses etc. are facilitated and the players will have to pass less official media @-@ dates before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 US travellers bringing bot@@ tled articles into the plane , find a survey . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by airplane passengers turned out that over 20 percent consciously or un@@ consciously embarrass@@ ed objects due to the check@@ points of the U.S. Transportation Security Administration passing by , including at least 6 percent , which entered the aircraft , while they accidentally banned the knife or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent claimed it was late , they discovered that they have been mistaken with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; survey with more than 1,000 people - provided by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , carried out - also stated that younger travellers rather dis@@ miss the rules . &quot;
&quot; by the respon@@ dents , the assur@@ ances that they have not kno@@ w@@ ingly sought to fly with something that was banned by the T@@ SA , were about 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X were . &quot;
&quot; the most common items , which were visi@@ oned to T@@ SA agents , were foods and liquids . &quot;
&quot; more than 3 percent en@@ acted , kno@@ w@@ ingly found objects with blades carried by the security check , while 2.@@ 2 percent of the female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had brought a pur@@ pose@@ ful drug in the plane . &quot;
&quot; the company said , I interviewed travelers in the whole country to find out how many accidentally smu@@ g@@ gers had brought about by the airport security and how many could have been inten@@ tionally done . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that people , the most likely smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware - kno@@ w@@ ingly or un@@ kno@@ w@@ ingly - wear by the safety , those who fly most frequently . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are slightly complicated and confusing . &quot;
people are often uncertain of what liquids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
&quot; so , there is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids conf@@ is@@ cated by the T@@ SA are conf@@ is@@ cated . &quot;
for a while the people who T@@ SA could read books as smu@@ g@@ gel@@ ware .
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k is it no matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la @-@ Customer cancel order
&quot; electro @-@ thou@@ sand@@ s@@ assa El@@ on Mus@@ k , with the huge number of pre@@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
so far he has worked so far that a part of the customer has withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation again .
&quot; in addition to the always triumph@@ ant figures for wag@@ ering rates and even a gigantic sales target , Tes@@ la Chef El@@ on Mus@@ k announced another , less gl@@ oss @-@ full number : the cancellation Policy in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k has often applied for the new car in recent months , whose delivery just begins . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k 1 : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders have been withdrawn since 6@@ 3,000 already . &quot;
critics had always pointed out that it is only a non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in a cancellation , Tes@@ la will pay the 1000 Euro ( in the USA 1000 US dollars and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently , 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations before , sp@@ elled mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; that cancellation of so far about twelve percent of all orders may become a problem , the Tes@@ la administrator does not believe . &quot;
&quot; its argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production page . &quot;
&quot; last year Tes@@ la 8@@ 4,000 vehicles delivered . &quot;
&quot; 2018 : all models have been assembled - 500,000 , 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , currently a day 1800 reservation is coming . &quot;
&quot; who ordered today a &quot; &quot; Model 3 &quot; &quot; is to count on delivery in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la creates , its brand new , never tested in practice tested production roads without any major inter@@ rup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; however , it comes to larger delays , then the binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot send out dis@@ satisfied customers in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA @-@ Chef P@@ ru@@ itt moves back because of the &quot; hesit@@ ant &quot; of the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions back
&quot; a day after having been compl@@ ained by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authorities , to delay his previous decision , to reduce the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollution . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , as its agency proved to meet the needs of state environmental authorities towards more responsive than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the law@@ suit which was raised against his previous position in a state of occupation .
&quot; it is a deadline , which was running on 1 October for states in order to adhere to the standards of 2015 for down @-@ down o@@ zone . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt reported in June that he will delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority over time , to study the plan and avoid , to interfere in local decisions or to im@@ pe@@ de economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was in front of his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump pro@@ secutor of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma , has long been a reliable ad@@ versary of environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington P@@ ru@@ itt repeatedly have passed , to block regulations or delay , which resist the chemical industry and industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden conversion of Wednesday is the most recent legal return for the P@@ ru@@ ff regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a state of occupation in Washington has decided that the EPA @-@ ste@@ ward has exceeded his authority as he tried to complete the implementation of a rule of Obama administration , the oil and gas company for monitoring and reduction of meth@@ ane @-@ catering . &quot;
&quot; in one on Wednesday night , P@@ ru@@ dence proposed that its turn@@ around at o@@ zone standards could simply be the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of timely meeting of the new standards reinforced . &quot;
&quot; in previous administr@@ ations , EPA has often not observed the deadlines for carrying out and then waited to set the appointment of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the appointment for the implementation , &quot; &quot; P@@ ru@@ itt said the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
&quot; we also take the law and authority that gives us , seriously . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA have said that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually be able to use his &quot; &quot; authority to be &quot; &quot; delay and all other legal authority , to ensure that the rules &quot; &quot; are based on solid policies and the best available information . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Republi@@ can in Congress are pushing for a more broader re @-@ ordin@@ ance of the o@@ zone .
&quot; a bill , approved by the rules of 2015 for at least eight years in the last month . &quot;

&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Pro@@ secutor Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of the states which had compl@@ ained the EPA in that week , said the Group intended to maintain the statutory pressure . &quot;

tum@@ our celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area is invited to the old cemetery area on Sunday , 16 July to 16,@@ 30 at a seren@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historical St. Hil@@ arius area is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the sixth Bene@@ fi@@ z seren@@ ade can be enchanted by this powerful place .
rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village have made friends and conve@@ ying tum@@ bling to their concern .
&quot; Walter Mart@@ ini says : &quot; &quot; it is a unique village &quot; &quot; Klein@@ od &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ ar@@ elle was first mentioned in the Wur@@ ttem@@ berg Mountains . count Hermann of Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the rec@@ tan@@ ces of the parish church , the Vo@@ g@@ tei , &quot; Mag@@ ister Eber@@ hard by Hor@@ b and his brother Diet@@ rich for 20 Mark Silver . &quot;
&quot; the wording of the certificate after the turmoil was on the tumor of the parish church except the one @-@ time parish church , to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ board was quite belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , apart from the sub@@ village and the Ober@@ dorf , which today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , was still visible , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around the year 1600 under@@ pin these historical circumstances .
the Pat@@ ron@@ ym was born from the early medieval property of the church .
&quot; a master who built up a church , signed and occupied with a priest , pers@@ isted as owner of this church and could also inher@@ it this church . &quot;
&quot; associated with it was the right to use a pastor , or the Bishop to propose a new priest . &quot;
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells in the tower .
the biggest of the two crum@@ ble at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell bell then appeared in 16@@ 92 , but had to be released later during World War II in 1942 . &quot;
in the 30 @-@ year war ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the windows of windows were stolen and the bell @-@ parts were stolen .
the roof was imper@@ me@@ able .
17@@ 96 stor@@ med French troops close to the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
remn@@ ants of the church threatened in 18@@ 09 .
until 18@@ 69 the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from hear@@ ters .
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m were allowed to stand .
in the New Year &apos;s eight 18@@ 34 a storm ra@@ ke the Kir@@ cht@@ ur@@ m and the half were rus@@ hed .
&quot; to prevent an evil , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the today still existing tur@@ m@@ z@@ wer@@ g stayed as a witness of the 750 years old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ en@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em take care of &quot; &quot; Cre@@ ating Rent@@ als &quot; &quot; as the successor of Dieter Dock@@ horn to the Hil@@ arius @-@ facility . &quot;
&quot; as an organis@@ er invite friends and sponsors of their tum@@ our on Sunday , 16 July , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery for St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle . &quot;
this is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler @-@ G@@ ymnasi@@ ums Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with words of Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Matte@@ is .
town of Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 16.00 hours .
the admission is from 3 : 30 PM .
to the end of the seren@@ ade there is a trunk in front of the cemetery .
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to forest , the organis@@ ers provide the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade is only held at dri@@ er weather .
&quot; the organis@@ ers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historical St. Hil@@ arius , which is of importance for tum@@ ours and speakers . &quot;
the friends and sponsors of the tum@@ our are feeling especially oblig@@ ated by the home care centres such as Seren@@ ade @-@ Organ@@ ator Walter Mart@@ ini .
society wants to test approval of winem@@ akers
&quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim we@@ es itself &quot; does not look at any legal condition for the construction and therefore has turned towards the country council .
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; &quot; stems from Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ ils ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , no wind turbines would have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only on the border to swal@@ low a wind power zone existed . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are basically possible , at the same time the concentration zone , but a exclusion of wind use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones should prevent a &quot; savings &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the town of Vier@@ sen had a few days previously decided by a change in the surface area for a second wind power zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette - which , however , had not approved the District Court of Düsseldorf , because of a lack of failure . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planned legal requirement , the shared author@@ ising ad@@ ress remains un@@ lawful and therefore also decreasing , &quot; &quot; said Christoph First , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : the City Council once again decided the wind @-@ concentration zone in the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , for the approval of the District government . &quot;
&quot; idea : &quot; &quot; for this , the division of approval for the establishment of wind turbines are not legally excluded . &quot;
the circle confirms the input of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received for past week in the district of Vier@@ sen , &quot; stated a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them as an occasion to check the matter again .
but they are likely not likely to make sure that the procedure is stopped .
&quot; with a view to the ongoing proceedings at the Board of Directors , the circle on Thursday wanted to speak out of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ ish@@ eim &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NE@@ W Re , a subsidiary of NE@@ W , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ ish@@ ei@@ mer N@@ ette , the construction of four meters high winds . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company had already participated in which the town quad@@ rup@@ tible is involved , with the owner of about 65 hectares of large joints closed . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the power supply of around 11 400 households is to be covered - this corresponds to approximately one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four @-@ four households . &quot;
the NE@@ W Re wants to invest around 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer there was a green light for buying three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch at Aachen , as well as a stake in a wind farm in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor cras@@ hes together : woman dies in a terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident took place on Friday morning against 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ ber@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was fatal in this case .
two more people were easily injured .
the national road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch came together with her car in the accompanying car with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as companion person the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
city and distributors are planning &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za@@ ars and people from the region are to re@@ discover shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .
the commercial stroke and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the shopping stroll in the city center .
&quot; like the president of the trial one , Christian König , announced the &quot; &quot; home &quot; &quot; weekend to raise the customers for this , which offers their own city away from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; according to this , there is a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic companies are supposed to present themselves with their apprentic@@ es@@ hips . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city are to be inviting to &quot; &quot; M@@ It@@ ter@@ at night &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the promotion aims not only on residents of the city and the nearby region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bag which point out to the cap@@ tions @-@ weekend , so Christian King . &quot;
city administration and commercial are co @-@ operation with the Chamber of Commerce and Commerce .
&quot; thus , the trial is one and the city enters another stage of the &quot; At@@ trac@@ tive downtown &quot; project . &quot;
&quot; these include new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Ak@@ tiv Day &quot; &quot; to the Brun@@ nen@@ fest and res@@ trained Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ ks and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and bi@@ valve on parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials will be new or re @-@ opened . &quot;
includes spa guests and tourists .
&quot; however , many locals also have lost the city center at night@@ fall from sight . &quot;
&quot; in the end , we must all contribute to revi@@ ve the city centre - to landlords , the operations of the whole city and associations . &quot;
&quot; she managed to overcome the le@@ th@@ arg@@ y network , which did partly spread , had told King in spring . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git Stre@@ ich , shared director of the Chamber of Industry in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , shared the third &quot; &quot; home country &quot; &quot; day for the first time , five Thur@@ in@@ gian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Wei@@ mar , S@@ ö@@ sten da , Heiligen@@ stadt and St@@ ron@@ age . &quot;
&quot; to promote the esteem of local trade and promote its importance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
the action conducted by the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence its own direct environment .

p@@ umping set after penetr@@ ated trans@@ cri@@ ptions by phone call Mexico under pressure due to the payment of the border council
trans@@ cription by phone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and Le@@ aders of Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tr@@ ump in a telephone call with the Mexican President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to to quit , publicly say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US President as@@ ts him because he had publicly denoun@@ ced the Berlin Wall . saying , &quot; &quot; he said to him , &quot; &quot; This cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump started his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall to the southern border of the United States , and s@@ wor@@ e , Mexico for the project . &quot;
trans@@ cri@@ p@@ te of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ tables were also published and revealed a tense exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who emigr@@ ated to Australia , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and that the punishment of the government would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call , after he had said Mr Turn@@ bull , &quot; &quot; This is the most uncomfortable call for the whole day . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ ores Ford @-@ massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice again , &quot;
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mercury was driving through a group of spectators in rural Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and went to the Ford @-@ bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had to reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with ri@@ f@@ les to block its path . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a man middle age in a needle @-@ strip - took a long train to his ci@@ gar and looked after the wind@@ shield .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; br@@ anded the man .
&quot; Ho@@ l him out of the car ! &quot;
&quot; scre@@ ams pieces the silence , when a young black man was torn from the passenger seat . &quot;
&quot; fortunately this terrible scene was played , which was played on July 22 , just a post@@ uring . &quot;
&quot; but if then a loop around the neck is thrown &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost all in the audience are very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 Civil Rights to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge returned to im@@ itate the night , in the two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ othy Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - from K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
nobody was ever charged with murder .
&quot; it really is un@@ questionable that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; said T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks , who helps in the organisation of post @-@ employment . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former Congress of Congress Georgia and a life of civil rights .
it serves as a dramatic call for action and represents an annual memory of the mon@@ ro@@ e community that an injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want the ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must maintain justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court practitioner puts a du@@ vet on the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to F@@ BI files , which were obtained from the N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding graph@@ ite were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none has ever been charged .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on an open foot for decades , citizens say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 made a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice ruling the black citizens in Georgia for the first time , to surrender to their vote in the Summer Elec@@ tions in the summer . &quot;
&quot; at about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the F@@ BI of the black farmer , Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , while fighting a fight - supposedly with a woman . &quot;
&quot; Broo@@ ks said that rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ othy and that the baby , she carried her , did not own from her husband . &quot;
&quot; on 25 July 1946 Lo@@ y Harrison , a prominent white land@@ owners , 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , so that F@@ BI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ othy and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to the prison .
&quot; but when they removed from the prison and get closer to the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b turned the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Harrison which has prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , closes a F@@ BI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a compromise between the state and local prosecution who was not only involved in the mur@@ ders , asser@@ ted evidence and conf@@ esses the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks hur@@ ts it even more striking .
&quot; it was a vot@@ al massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; you were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you register and if you vote , it will happen here . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , C@@ ass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual successor of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , po@@ ign@@ ant and is founded in a kind of deep racism , from which many believe in America it is no longer exists . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to watch , and still more difficult to look away , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we do not want to talk about the Lyn@@ n , because we are then confronted with its u@@ gl@@ iness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; but I cannot build any relationship with you , if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not to hear what I have done through . &quot;
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - in a room and lau@@ ghing as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ played overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Green@@ es Co @-@ director .
&quot; he has played the role of the boss cl@@ ans for years , but he said , the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I am not so , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it &apos;s very important to keep this story alive , because we do not want to return to these times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room tried the actors D@@ arri@@ us Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester shou@@ ting and aff@@ licted him , angry that he has slept with his wife Dor@@ othy . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , conce@@ de of my own property ! &quot;
Ras@@ cona er@@ wi@@ den the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) in laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh at the lau@@ ghing .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; asked Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still ki@@ cking . &quot;
I don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos;@@ n --- he said .
&quot; but , &quot; T@@ wit@@ ted one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to meet the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there shifts the energy in the room , a feeling of cam@@ ar@@ ader@@ ie replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy doing this properly , not only because of the game but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ cona the N word says , it says it sharp and with re@@ pressure . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there is scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman cloth@@ ed with a funeral dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actor and performs Billi@@ e Holidays , &quot; St@@ range Fruit &quot; . &quot; &quot;
your voice in every second word breaks .
about a hundred meters behind it caught a group of about four dozen viewers per@@ spir@@ ation and tears from the eyes .
the audience is divided almost even@@ ly between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come down the street . &quot;
&quot; they have witnessed almost eight hours of Georgian moisture when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tombs of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; however , up to this point the mur@@ ders have remained an anec@@ d@@ ote , but now when one stands on the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de takes place , the air feels sal@@ v@@ ein . &quot;
&quot; when the final notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the amount to get closer and the cor@@ pse is insp@@ ected . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ cken at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whis@@ pering each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , mur@@ mu@@ red a little boy , he wants to remember it . &quot;
after a few minutes we would like to thank Gre@@ ene lots - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw the Lyn@@ ch@@ sei@@ l away and wi@@ pe off their tears .
Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who has played the cl@@ ans . &quot;
Nick Ras@@ cona revers@@ ed two of his fellow @-@ players and then breaks in their arms crying together , the emotional load of the performance eventually breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it is okay , &quot; whis@@ pering one of the women . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you have done this for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sets up with the actors for dinner together .
&quot; just chat on a table a white pair from Atlanta is excited about the post@@ uring with a black pair , that they have just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ ski fought for finding words which feeling the performance has left .
&quot; it is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you themselves and who do what they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; she added &quot; &quot; today she is called the only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room T@@ yr@@ one Broo@@ ks yard on his table , he e@@ ats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he already started to plan the performance in the next year .
&quot; the post @-@ position is in some way inspir@@ ational , because it describes the hor@@ rors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like we do not learn from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever has not studied his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat them . &quot;
&quot; Arma@@ ge@@ d@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ re@@ uth
&quot; also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , Frank Cast@@ orf is composed on a bright fri@@ vol@@ e staging of gigantic six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the turn@@ around ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar Den@@ ic ) , op@@ tionally showing a s@@ hab@@ by street corner of the L@@ rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR &apos;s times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that is an open Mercedes @-@ Old@@ timer , in which the Rhein@@ h@@ esti@@ bu@@ d pos@@ ing as rock@@ erg@@ ir@@ ls , or alternatively an I@@ setta . &quot;
&quot; stu@@ ffed oil cas@@ ks remember Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which goes through its &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ foolish - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ clay and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise like already in the &quot; &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she se@@ duc@@ ed Sieg@@ fried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , cr@@ acked a cor@@ pse in the trunk , and enter the Kra@@ w@@ allo Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the glorious ha@@ ge which surrounds the au@@ ra of a heav@@ y@@ weight .
brutal the scene when he frightened Sieg@@ fried .
later also has to believe in Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) .
the audience thanks it to the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and Di@@ vin@@ ent Jan@@ owski , who are modest and laid the hands on Merkel smo@@ ked . &quot;
great applause for the festival is for the first time - given the great heat back in empty leisure clothes .
with tension was expected the appearance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his Regi@@ ete@@ am .
&quot; in 2013 he had yet to leave a country @-@ end Pfei@@ f@@ Concer@@ to over himself , there were five years later great Ju@@ bel , in which the &quot; &quot; bu@@ h &quot; &quot; went under@@ went . &quot;
celebrations in Kath@@ arina Wagner is likely to have been happy about it .
&quot; one notices that the audience has grown together with the &quot; Ring &quot; in a certain way , &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only have a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also has grown into an understanding of its perspective . &quot;
I draw up a positive slogan .
max amount is working as a volunteer
you work in a volunteer year at the same time in several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : usually in St@@ einf@@ urt in the pur@@ se , once a week I &apos;ll help here in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have already worked at school in an open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; quantity : it is a nice , wide range that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years , so a late volunteer volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I made Ab@@ it@@ ur .
&quot; and then a building studies , we say that we have been successfully abandoned . &quot;
I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to make something else to work with people .
and then I asked myself what do you do .
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I have collected some great impressions .
I will start my studies in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study a dual study , I probably do a social training course in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne in Ham@@ m at the Fach@@ hoch@@ schule . &quot;
is it not uncommon to have several different fields during the Volun@@ te@@ er Service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
always it always depends where you can be FS@@ J .
one can make it from Alter@@ sheim to youth work - in all possible fac@@ ets of social work .
with me it was very varied .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was the right thing that has mat@@ ured me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs .
different than in the building of civil engineering ?
&quot; quantity : well clear , here it is not about to figure St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; there is always another person in mind , each of which has a very different story behind him . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been r@@ acked out of the family - you always have to go in an individual way . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations about reservations ?
quantity : for this I am not the guy .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , lots of friendliness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but so is life . &quot;

&quot; the British educational group Pear@@ son said on Friday , she will cut further 3,000 jobs and cut their intermediate aged by 72 per cent as another restructuring program will be started to overcome the pressure by which the company faces . &quot;

Kon@@ vo@@ i attack by Kab@@ ul : NATO soldier killed in su@@ icide attack
&quot; a su@@ icide bom@@ b@@ bed has attacked a military con@@ voy at the Afgh@@ an capital Kab@@ ul , a soldier of Nato and several others have been violated . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpre@@ ter were wounded , shared an explanation of Nato . &quot;
&quot; according to the local reports , according to the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h also three civilians were killed . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan took this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
on Monday a su@@ icide bom@@ bed was killed in the immediate vicinity of the Iraqi Embassy in Kab@@ ul .
&quot; in a position of Nato , NATO is called the explosion on Thursday evening , when a joint pat@@ rol was attacked with the Afgh@@ an army of a &quot; &quot; guided jumps &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all the injured in a stable state can be treated and treated in the U.S. military hospital at the air@@ field in Bag@@ ram .
correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group that is known as so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h is a big concern for NATO troops in the nearby Bag@@ ram .
&quot; according to the United Nations , there was at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian deaths in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which around 20 % in the capital . &quot;

&quot; the force under@@ scores the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , since U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump decrease the number of US troops , military and police in the country . &quot;
correspon@@ dents say that the su@@ icide attacks in Kab@@ ul has also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government to have caused its policy and especially in the reputation of President As@@ hr@@ af Gh@@ ani .
EPA returns decision to del@@ aying the Smo@@ g rule by means of law@@ suits
&quot; the US American environmental protection authority has taken a decision to delay a regulation of the government of Obama , after which the states are committed to imp@@ lied the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this was done a day after 15 states the Agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced that late on Wednesday the decision to drive on the so called &quot; Oz@@ on@@ cology 2015 &quot; , &quot; and said , they show the obligation of the agency to work with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and in mind that we respond to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA @-@ Chief Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced in June the intention of EPA , the o@@ zone regulations in which to be measured in part of the country &apos;s pollut@@ ant emissions , to determine where inc@@ isions must be made to delay more stringent air quality standards - to delay a year until October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , reached the Tuesday law@@ suit and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive a wide range of environmental regulations that the former President Barack Obama has imposed , as part of a wider agenda , which is to boost economic growth according to Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have triggered the impact of Democrats and reserves , which are worried about the impact of larger emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of EPA says that the inhal@@ ation of air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; the pulmon@@ ary function , and can reinforce the breathing symptoms &quot; such as as@@ thma . &quot;
community @-@ council wants common areas
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : with two oppos@@ ites , the council of flu@@ orn rests with the establishment of a community space in the future homes . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing property is signed , the mayor of Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will still take until the area belonging to the parish community is owned by the parish community , but there is now no planning event for that of a private investor on st@@ em@@ ing project . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common space .
&quot; one of the two investors still in the boat , has offered the community to meet . &quot;
&quot; on the ground floor , it would be a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with all 70 square meters area for a special price . &quot;
&quot; for the administration and the majority of the community council , such a common room will not only be seen as the meeting place just for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ en@@ fair dwelling , but openly into the church . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; took the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision is made by providing funds for the current household in autumn , by means of funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the rehabilitation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common space would be , thus reports T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposed proposal is to signal to the investor that in this respect you don &apos;t want to throw a bil@@ lets between the legs , the finding that both Satt@@ el@@ - and the ambient height - as well as P@@ ult@@ an@@ ach - which makes up the trend @-@ height and the construction of economic power - they would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less , not only Wil@@ fred Soh@@ mer , be this supplement . &quot;
if it helps : the unanim@@ ity happened in the body .
it is not as easy as the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s reputation refers to the many of its own buildings with which you do not go so right now , for that you should rest now in the common room from the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I do so hard with it . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger necessarily speaks for the common room , but absolutely against a municipal participation . &quot;
it does not see an covered sub@@ strate on any high level or foreign investors .
&quot; that is not so , because with the acquisition of the area you do not give a grant , but get a real , in doubt @-@ able object is the oppos@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; request proposal , to request the proposal on request , finds three advocates . &quot;
&quot; then it remains with two oppos@@ ites at the original program , which is summ@@ arized by Stefan H@@ aller : &quot; &quot; when we summ@@ arize the decision , we make a huge step to close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;

&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical constitution , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; this was last not good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the 58 @-@ year @-@ old , however , believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory of the season . &quot;

walking in the Har@@ z of Stern to Stern
in the Har@@ z the first star star is to develop .
this is planning the association Stern@@ warte St Andre@@ as@@ berg .
a planetary track is in Gött@@ ingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; star trail &quot; come contrary to the information given by many har@@ c@@ ers , says it . &quot;
&quot; it includes nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up the planned route along the planned route and inform them about stars and star pictures .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; &quot; well @-@ reaching installations to five to six places &quot; &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß und Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the boards should be added to the internet .
&quot; therefore , the choice of a good mobile network reception plays a role . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
later the star@@ pf@@ ad train should be expanded by train .
&quot; on the stell@@ ar ad the viewer receives plenty of facts about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; also , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star more lumin@@ aire than another , although it is essentially further away . &quot;
&quot; I will also be conve@@ yed in which constellation can find a chosen star , and when he is best seen . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been operating in the Berg@@ städ@@ t St. Andre@@ as@@ berg mountain , which is the highest located observatory in Northern Germany . &quot;
the location in the middle of the National Park Har@@ z is one of the federal states for nature conservation at the six dark@@ est regions in Germany .
frequently they are seen from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ meda @-@ galaxy with the naked eye clearly visible .
in the university city since 2003 it has been on initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Gött@@ ingen . something similar to the planned star@@ ch - the Plan@@ etary Mills Day has been established in 2003 .
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ dy Hotel in Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary trail leads up up to Hain@@ berg and for an observatory - as well as an &quot; extrater@@ restrial site in Di@@ em@@ arden ( commune of equ@@ als ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the st@@ em@@ s with the individual planets - including the d@@ warf plan@@ ed degra@@ ded Plu@@ to at the end point - are accurately positioned in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks so to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 70 meters away from the sun . &quot;
the whole distance of the planetary track is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light is needed from Sun to Plu@@ to about eight hours , pedest@@ rians also need a good hour to stand with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedest@@ rians are thus faster than the light in the cosmos .
the march to the next Fi@@ x@@ stern but would last half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who are in a collision event in order to staged the most exciting pit battle in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN office in Los Angeles , to Gar@@ cia , the un@@ attended World Bo@@ xing Council light champion , down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization Super @-@ spring champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ ci@@ as victory through an agre@@ eable vote about the former four @-@ Di@@ visions World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at show@@ time , both fighters members of the top five Po@@ und for Po@@ und List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out the right hand and said , &quot; How is it to thee ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko defended his belt against Miguel Marri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 19 : 00 on ES@@ PN .
&quot; as the couple for pictures pos@@ ing , Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Klim@@ as , that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect size &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring @-@ weight , &quot; reminded Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; I have asc@@ ended to Bron@@ er &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I am not so great . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to light weight .
and he must move in heav@@ y@@ weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that demand the fans .
let us give them that . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko agreed .
&quot; boxes needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy to arrange Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko with a 135 @-@ pound debut in this year , in order to schedule a date in the next summer with Gar@@ cia ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Campbell according to their lightweight balance in the forum on September 23 . &quot;
&quot; this struggle could take place in the pay @-@ per @-@ view mode because all the fans asked for him , &quot; &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and op@@ te later openly , to fight with the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can create this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said , he cher@@ ish Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko as &quot; an enormous comb@@ at@@ ants , &quot; and he might be taking part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko held with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he just think the three @-@ fight Champion from River@@ side &quot; looks very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to be co @-@ Aus . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show head@@ strength , then boxes . &quot;
&quot; both spoke , they could feel the momentum , which was built for their own struggle . &quot;
&quot; this is the fight , which has to be carried out . &quot;
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ en@@ ko said , &quot; &quot; I waited for the top comb@@ at@@ ants , and that is Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great struggle . &quot;
four wounded after tire in T@@ ire
&quot; in an accident at the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver lost an Opel Z@@ af@@ ira against 16,@@ 30 p.m. just before the junction market , probably after a tire bla@@ zer take control of his vehicle . &quot;
&quot; the car stopped right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he proposed and then lying on the roof of the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
&quot; the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children , were severely injured during the accident . &quot;
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured due to the b@@ ail@@ out service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction north for about an hour , then the traffic could pass by on the left lane at the exp@@ iry point . &quot;
Fort@@ un@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; Trinity works better &quot;
Andre Hoffmann hopes for 2 : 2 to the season op@@ ener to Braunschwei@@ g that brings the optimization of the barrel formation in Au@@ e points .
&quot; the first of the season was Andre Hoffmann , with the result also , would not have been the two opponents at the 2 : 2 against Braunschwei@@ g . &quot;
&quot; these were two oppos@@ ites too much , and we have to do better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enses of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
in the Or@@ e Mountains the triple should continue to be optimized further .
and there is no more gate to a gate according to a Fre@@ isto@@ ß .
for the future it will be so that no longer next to Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will focus on the line .
&quot; today , Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better to cope with the experiences in preparation with the tr@@ end@@ ette , than with the quad@@ rup@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; yet I do not know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ rich@@ m Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just finished in the tr@@ amp in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko G@@ ie@@ ß@@ mann players who can well build up &quot; , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; a prerequisite is , however , that we can harmon@@ ise even better and we cannot afford so many mistakes . &quot;
&quot; of course , also drives to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; whether you can speak according to an un@@ decided by a miserable start , do not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be quite okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and will be able to concentrate on the podium , we will surely be able to speak from a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
of this his trainer wanted nothing to know .
&quot; the start of the season evalu@@ ates only after six to eight rounds , &quot; said Fried@@ rich@@ m Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to speak from an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of Saxony in Hei@@ den@@ heim had prematurely to be thrown down because of a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season virtually with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann believe that players from Au@@ e might even be something fresh , as they would not have he@@ avi@@ est and complete game like Fort@@ una against a rise of Ascension in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they do not know so 100 % where they are currently standing , &quot; says the inside defence of the Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland as an easy favorite on Sunday go to the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadi@@ on from Au@@ e .
&quot; that we swe@@ ep them just because we have the claim to come under the first six , is Bl@@ ö@@ de@@ dness , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose balance sheet in just a defeat against Au@@ e from nine matches is certainly positive . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to beat from the outset , &quot; explains Fort@@ un@@ as Chief Executive . &quot;
&quot; such a statement of meeting would be arrogan@@ t and adul@@ ter@@ ous . &quot;
and so he will not experience his players on Sunday .
new results of the Swedish asylum application test published
&quot; recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subjected to a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that over 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authority for for@@ en@@ sic medicine ( puzzle medic@@ in@@ al@@ wi@@ et ) has begun with the performance of tests last year .
&quot; they should be more precise , while the evaluation of the age should be more precise , after the Swedish Migr@@ ations Authority ( Migr@@ ation Me@@ et ) has been critici@@ zed due to mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , Migr@@ ations has sent 6.@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now released the results of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person may &quot; possibly 18 years or older .
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person is &quot; possibly under 18 years old .
tests will only be done in cases where the person &apos;s age is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are consistently established in the past months . &quot;
&quot; we do not see big difference in statistics of past months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the Local Journal The Local . &quot;
&quot; the high proportion of instances in which the person was assessed as over 18 years , does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers has to be over its age . &quot;
in May the agency released the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there are 4@@ 42 cases to suggest that the preliminary person was 18 years or older .
&quot; when the newspaper S@@ ven@@ ska D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det the results published in 5@@ 81 , they stated that in the 243 of these cases the person had openly said that they will be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical savings assessment , made in the x @-@ ray shots of we@@ ather@@ teeth and MR@@ I scans , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critici@@ zed in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a skep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska @-@ Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of men to see whether they went earlier or later than pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; I had reason to think about it , and I don &apos;t think that the type of measurement should be used . &quot;
assessing the biological age in this way is very uncertain .
&quot; if we cannot say it certainly , we should not do as if we could , &quot; he said the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency def@@ ends the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is un@@ correct . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk lies in it if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
fully in the plan
the work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are well underway .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven tons of emphasis was placed on the bridge at the eastern outskirts of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold L@@ asi@@ ly , Bau@@ manager at the Department of Art and Transport in the President of Freiburg . &quot;
in April the works at the same time began on all three sandy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
building is provided for October and E@@ asi@@ ly is certain that the schedule is maintained .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads through the tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ ault bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total @-@ length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in the year 1900 .
&quot; like the other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the stability of stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished . &quot;
the other two bridges lead to the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are built of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10.@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance to the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on the mid@@ day tomorrow , on the north side a 1,@@ 30 meters wide and seven tonnes heavy so @-@ called fr@@ appe . &quot;
this is a Rand@@ y attachment that is also used as a business path .
on the southern part of the bridge the bridge is to be inserted on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meters wide bridge cap .
then the pedest@@ rians then went out .
&quot; the special thing is that it is about finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already provided with the patented frac@@ tures .
particular finger@@ tips has demanded the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
because there is also a glass of fibre which many companies are connected .
the inhabitants were informed in advance of the work by hand@@ writing about the project .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ st@@ ace@@ ans had to be cut off . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building of the building and the gathering , towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by one light lane . &quot;
for the construction work on the Lau@@ ter@@ bacher village entrance the street is locked in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ en@@ hof &quot; and &quot; Si@@ eben Lin@@ den . &quot;
the cost of the three Brü@@ ck@@ ens@@ ani@@ ans amount to 700 000 euros .
financed the whole by the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ under protest in German potato salad
&quot; it does not happen so frequently that parties are pulling in an impulse , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) comes together , which is otherwise difficult to bring under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented at the Kre@@ ist@@ ag Vol@@ u@@ ity represented by the parties ( CD@@ U , SPD , Green , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad coalition that held on this day peaceful flag , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle Ron@@ dell to be invited to the poster &apos;s &quot; great electoral campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start brings - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land is the leading celebration of the Par@@ liam@@ entary elections on September 24 , and the Vice @-@ President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ for@@ ers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the Brun@@ nen@@ platz , but now finds in the parking lot below the Ron@@ d@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christian Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really pleased : &quot; &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which could also eat Af@@ ales , &quot; &quot; says the woman who has brought it . &quot;
&quot; the police have be@@ dert many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , she also shows presence in front of the railway station , which is only a few meters from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D have actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ es reported by the Af@@ D Vol@@ u@@ fel area , he endeav@@ ored to make such an event and get the supplement . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf first asked me in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built @-@ in foli@@ r@@ enti@@ st kir@@ mes not enough parking available . &quot;
&quot; so now the Ron@@ dell , Hom@@ pes is happy that we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this also does it : against 20 p.m. on the Ron@@ d@@ ell@@ vor@@ platz a band for entertainment , in the city hall various speakers , including the Rhin@@ eland @-@ pf@@ alz Af@@ D leader Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 list@@ eners who are waiting for the leading can@@ did@@ acy for the parliamentary elections , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Chairman of Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; unchanged is the police presence , but so far the officials had a peaceful evening . &quot;
&quot; some more than an hour will take the Af@@ D event , the guests on the court have a longer breath , but also there is a short walk to 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can put back - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets the trumpet
&quot; a recur@@ rent with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ aun@@ ist Freder@@ ic B@@ elli , there are in the series Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ group@@ ed tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian Tro@@ mp@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea &quot; hits Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; &quot; hits a classical German training with roots in brass music . &quot;
&quot; both sol@@ o@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions , and have sol@@ opo@@ si@@ tions in the European league . &quot;
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is Sol@@ op@@ os@@ aun@@ t of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both united the desire to not only exceed the boundaries of their instruments , but to merge the limits of different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds at the two as in a new guise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ ders &quot; world music , &quot; combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the J@@ azz@@ ech@@ op@@ lane N@@ ils Wo@@ gram , mix classic , jazz and the free play to an intrigu@@ ing work of art . &quot;
this core part of the program was recently premi@@ ered this spring with high @-@ quality success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils Wo@@ gram has failed to write it for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ l@@ acher Kloster@@ kirche with their particular acousti@@ cs will be consciously involved in the concert .
Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ ex@@ ual
&quot; some people love gri@@ pped cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; so Kr@@ isten Ste@@ wart very open about their bis@@ ex@@ ual sides . &quot;
&quot; when I got stuck in grilled cheese , I think , &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the probably most known relationship of Hol@@ ly@@ re stars was that of her &quot; &quot; t@@ wilight &quot; &quot; colleague Robert Patt@@ inson , who finally made bitter . &quot;
&quot; despite all this insur@@ es the br@@ other@@ ly Dar@@ stell@@ erin opposite the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Baz@@ aar &quot; &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I had . &quot;
&quot; or do you believe , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after their separation , Kr@@ isten gave to that she was bis@@ ex@@ ual : &quot; I have always lived the du@@ alism and believe it seriously . &quot;
so it has never been confused or hin@@ dered .
I &apos;ve never liked it to be taken seriously .
&quot; particularly beneath , I have &quot; &quot; Bang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; but in school time , when they prefer like a bu@@ b : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really has been hurt .
&quot; when I was eleven told me the children , I would look like a bu@@ b . &quot;
I really felt attacked and scar@@ ed and ashamed .
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially to the public they don &apos;t like to give her love life : &quot; people expect you to take you in a certain way and that upset me .
&quot; and perhaps I call myself some un@@ grateful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot;
governor of West Virginia announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic Gover@@ nor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today , I will tell you a lot of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can no longer help you when I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the manifestation broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; says Justice . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it is time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump spoke a HU@@ GE announcement in the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice announced not the democratic nom@@ inee Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes lays out that he owns coal mines in five states and inherited from his father a carbon business .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; meanwhile the Republi@@ can National Committee held a statement on Thursday evening , in which it said : &quot; &quot; the party change of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which was more likely to work for us than to work in order to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 govern@@ ments and the control of the least legislative corporations in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is just the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom with no leadership and unable to find a positive , engaging message , &quot; said the R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ e lo@@ bt &quot; hon@@ orable &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the worldwide leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal but he repeated , it &apos;s not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in sports . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics and Dmit@@ ry Sh@@ yl@@ akh@@ tin was argued that the exile of his country was correct in sports during the evening , and that he would be determined to fight the dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who participated in competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comment@@ aries , the IA@@ AF Congress for the maintenance of the ban adopted in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) had found references to stat@@ eless D@@ oping in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the Re@@ porters . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the entire Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation has recognised with himself , that she has experienced some quite hot times and do everything possible to make sure the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ e said , he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to restore Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation . &quot;
&quot; the guiding principle was always , that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added &quot;
&quot; ninete@@ en Russian athletes compete in the athle@@ tics of the World Championship , which will begin on Friday in London , after the strict IA@@ AF criteria as a neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re@@ default . &quot;
&quot; threats tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free , he said Re@@ porters in London after a talk at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
funeral for in Mali had un@@ paved soldiers
&quot; with a funeral party in the North @-@ state Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two at a helicopter crash in Mali was thought of a bel@@ ated soldiers . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security arrangements .
&quot; for still un@@ resolved , Secretary @-@ Minister Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two revers@@ ed , but as &quot; K@@ ön@@ ner of her professional . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we tend to face this highest sacrifice that they have produced in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she stated . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year old staff from Nord@@ h@@ essen were born on Wednesday a week in the West African Mali .
their S@@ ands were transferred to Germany and was accompanied by a funer@@ ary guard of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Cathedral St. Peter .
at mid@@ day only the relatives were at the church farewell .
&quot; after that , the funeral took place in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the policy . &quot;
below were also H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
he laid down ro@@ ses in Roses and the relatives were arm in arms to the S@@ ands .
in front of the church Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers took the ceremony on a canvas .
Secretary of defense of the Le@@ yen called the &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; soldiers and brake . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann has built the flight operation of the batt@@ ling screw tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tigers pilot of his reg@@ iment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the reg@@ iment , to which the soldiers belong , stated : &quot; if this crew could not turn the cras@@ hing , there would not have been mistaken . &quot;
doubts about the UN Mission in Mali the minister of the Le@@ yen is not : the use is dangerous .
&quot; but he is also of high importance &quot; &quot; for a country where we are separated from only two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral party the S@@ är@@ ge were brought from the cathedral .
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not make any information . &quot;
Prinz Hen@@ rik wants no grave alongside his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , does not want to sh@@ aded his death next to his wife . &quot;
this was shared by the Royal House on Thursday .
traditionally the Danish king spa@@ ar is buried in the church of Ros@@ kil@@ de .
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ gaard has already created a sar@@ cop@@ ha@@ g for the two .
&quot; the queen was agreed with the decision of her husband , it says in the message . &quot;
&quot; where prince Hen@@ rik will be buried , be still unclear . &quot;
but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland .
Prinz Hen@@ rik never had a meal out of it that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the ascent of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would like to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he went into retirement and also sets the title &quot; Prin@@ c@@ Menu . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik in Denmark did not have the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene b@@ by , stated chief b@@ aker in the Danish king &apos;s house . &quot;
where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be unclear .
&quot; but he did not intend to teach in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .
&quot; Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French Adel@@ s@@ sohn , made Mar@@ gre@@ the 1965 in London . &quot;
he worked on the Thames in the French embassy .
&quot; during his later wife the sympath@@ ies of the people always flew , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy stand at the roofs of the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography Hen@@ rik over the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did . &quot;
&quot; my D@@ än@@ isch was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , sil@@ lu@@ str@@ ates instead of kn@@ it@@ so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Vol@@ vo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ lo@@ ises , which I smo@@ ked instead of Virginia tobacco and which in this country had the reputation to be the brand of society @-@ critical intellectuals , I could not hope in sight . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were just two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants swift re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP for possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; comm@@ itting the Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red @-@ green ruling majority , he wants to res@@ ign for a swift re @-@ election of the Mon@@ days , but he does not want to withdraw . &quot;
because she said on Friday for the resolution of the parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Greens party in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country @-@ election , the red @-@ green Coalition in Hannover thus lost its sheer curtain majority in the parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the former Greens party members El@@ ke v@@ ests formed their step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for election 2018 in their constitu@@ ency ( deser@@ ts ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
&quot; leader Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ ler &apos;s leader wants to recommend to his group , to include them . &quot;
&quot; that would have CD@@ U and F@@ DP together 69 seats in the Sax@@ on land , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship was the opposite .
the new land@@ tag will be elected regular on 14 January of the year .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said the red @-@ green national government should decide , whether in this situation no majority can be ruling without a majority . &quot;
&quot; however , Stephan Wei@@ l keeps it indispensable for that the country &apos;s tag decides as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U faction is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
&quot; the state of affairs also sees the possibility , that the country &apos;s day draws the confidence of the Prime Minister and chooses a successor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these opportunities must be legally checked , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ us@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; you will discuss all questions in peace , if they are legally checked . &quot;
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called a wes@@ terly , &quot; &quot; something short @-@ off . &quot; &quot;
the policy himself said : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she referred to as a Minister of Black @-@ Green .
the Greens demanded that the Euro MPs called for the return of their land day .
&quot; we are of course assuming that they receive their land at night , which they receive over the green country list , with immediate effect returns , &quot; the provincial Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president of the Green An@@ ja P@@ iel said , &quot; We regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ west greatly . &quot;
you have deliberately decided not to pronoun@@ ce any pron@@ unciation in the Group .
&quot; even in front of the background , that there were no content differences , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD chan@@ cell@@ or Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the survi@@ vor of the Anglo @-@ American MEP El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the conduct of former Greens in Lower Saxony is not only a betra@@ yal of voters and voters , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the president of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
&quot; he support the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SD@@ P ) , to quickly choose the country before . &quot;
the Austr@@ o @-@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; in its final van@@ ity and in their frustration , their personal interests are protected against the welfare of the country , &quot; critici@@ zed SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus . &quot;
&quot; it is a sc@@ andal , that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony makes this dirty in@@ tri@@ gen@@ ude and tries to strike it political capital . &quot;
&quot; comm@@ uting CD@@ U Leader , Bj@@ ör@@ n Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wanted to recommend to his Members , El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U . &quot;
&quot; leader of the SPD of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , cast the v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the country @-@ election 2013 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the CD@@ U was the strongest power , SPD and Green , in the country , but a hau@@ ghty majority of one voice . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister of Economic Affairs in an interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ sum , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discussed over contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) speech and answer .
Mr Schmidt - How can the consumer protect themselves from po@@ is@@ oned eggs ?
&quot; I can only encourage the consumer &apos;s consumer to look exactly the eggs in your refrigerator , and check the stamp pressure . &quot;
&quot; at the consumer protection portal www.@@ foodstuffs maintenance .de , the Bundes@@ länder will provide the most recent information about the egg @-@ char@@ ms of the egg @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
sufferers should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all we know currently , a health haz@@ ard is practically excluded . &quot;
&quot; now , Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of enligh@@ tening is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Germany ? &quot;
food surveillance is the task of the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and is since the disclosure of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; &quot; &quot; trade has just the same way as the producers to ensure that the goods sold are safe and hygien@@ ically safe . &quot;
&quot; if with eggs of the resi@@ dual percentage of 0.@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , these are not limited . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed .
this time not the operations are to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
after the high @-@ time knowledge of the production companies don &apos;t meet any immediate guilt .
&quot; rather , they must reck@@ on account of mut@@ tically illegal practice of services companies with economic damages . &quot;
as always there is too little inspec@@ tors in the harvest .
is there only a lack of personnel or responsible jurisdiction ?
&quot; however , it was just the official controls that have uncovered the process . &quot;
&quot; for truth , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; this is why a consequ@@ ent clarification of such events and the commit to the pro@@ secut@@ ors in the cases where crimes may exist , are of decisive importance . &quot;
&quot; I have already seen several times , that I expect a seamless education to the competent authorities . &quot;
is the regular alar@@ mis@@ m in food safety really necessary ?
consumers and consumers have the right to obtain only safe and reliable food .
&quot; when a legal insec@@ tici@@ de insec@@ tici@@ de is used in the food industry , consumer rights and consumers are rightly outra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by the ar@@ mor@@ ed means , manufacturers , dealers and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
basically it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ tici@@ des Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supply animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately .
&quot; it has to be worked on all levels , with high pressure on all levels . &quot;
&quot; I expect from all the competent authorities , that the atomic fact is dec@@ eived quickly and incomplete . &quot;
how the financial rules of Football will impact on Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
&quot; the rules , which aim to prevent , un@@ solic@@ ited expenses of European foot@@ ball@@ ers , will not distur@@ b Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s world @-@ record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Germain . &quot;
&quot; any consequences will take place for Paris Saint @-@ Germain from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that the European game monitors the power , teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules that have been launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to point out that the transfer from Ne@@ ym@@ ar was financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million euros ) to buy the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from his contract , and Ne@@ ym@@ ar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; PS@@ G can certainly make money easy , so Ne@@ ym@@ ar writes and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich ruling family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to apply a lot of money to the acquisition of players , but with legitimate revenue streams , they need to facilitate the Bre@@ ak Game dot in their own football business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini by his election at the UEF@@ A president in 2007 .
&quot; the former French players believed that clubs that had enormous debt in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin , if banks or owners withdraw their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P moved from concentration on the debts of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , the novel A@@ br@@ am@@ ovi@@ ch originally used in Chelsea - a club with potential bought and then power@@ fully invested to build the team and build a global brand - to a tougher matter . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P payments period , which runs through 2018 , clubs can take losses in the amount of EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini 2015 has fallen from the presidency in Un@@ gn@@ ade 2015 , his UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander Ce@@ fer@@ in will continue to be deter@@ red by excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so who is responsible at the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , opposite The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause from Ne@@ ym@@ ar in a breaks , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; Ne@@ ym@@ ar signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sol@@ uble @-@ solution for the next five years can be reported in the amount of 4@@ 4.@@ 4 million euros in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the most severe sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G was awarded EUR 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was later lowered to 20 million euros - and it was arranged that the team members are limited to the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 to 21 players instead of the ordinary 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to out@@ list their financial supervision by adding their revenues to companies , who are linked to the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a catalog of the PS@@ G could be spontaneous , if the value of sponsorship should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not let this be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsorship of P@@ SA was applied by Qatar &apos;s Tourism Authority . &quot;
&quot; it was reported that a part of the PS@@ G payments to Ne@@ ym@@ ar was reported on payments of the Organ@@ izing Committee of the World Cup , in Qatar . &quot;
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that Ne@@ ym@@ ar World Championship will be able to find out and be a such man@@ oeu@@ vre for the UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G would mean that the UEF@@ A is yet to be attentive , every attempt to observe the rules . &quot;
&quot; the UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G about Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cer on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
&quot; they spoke under the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation . &quot;
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of € 2.@@ 4 million for a profit of more than 10 million euros .
accounts for the final financial year must be published .
PS@@ G expects that Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s arrived a blessing for sponsorship De@@ als , merchan@@ dis@@ ing and tri@@ cot . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the association assumes that sales after signing at least 30 percent will rise . &quot;
&quot; the Spanish League has clearly been irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and tried to prevent Ne@@ y@@ mar@@ s gu@@ ide@@ ation by declar@@ ing that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; &quot; finance &quot; &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; &quot; said the President of the La League , Javier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in terms of Qatar &apos;s latter ownership in PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al Manager Arsen@@ e Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American Sport @-@ Ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that financed an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the owner and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football for the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has a club , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it will be very difficult to respect financial fairness , because one walks different paths or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is in search of a new shock
in recent years Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board has produced chocolate for Swiss francs .
&quot; now , the inter@@ acting collabor@@ ates in front of a possible end : the airline is writing the contract again . &quot;
&quot; Swiss @-@ speaker at Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ ott@@ t confirmed upon request of the news agency S@@ DA a corresponding report of the newspaper &quot; Northwest of Switzerland &quot; from Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the Air@@ line will release a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and are subject to quality control .
&quot; with the current supplier cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y we are very satisfied , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white hat@@ s up to 14 grams open each year the flight ladder in front of the landing to the passengers .
at the cost of the cost the Swiss does not want to make any information .
&quot; sector in@@ sider value the volume of order according to &quot; &quot; northwest Swiss franc &quot; &quot; on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary gains an annual turnover of approximately one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
&quot; however , more important is the advertising effect : for a shock manufacturer it is a prestigious contract . &quot;
how many applicants are eligible for the new tender that Swiss does not want to betra@@ y Swiss Life .
but there are only Swiss producers in question .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to reach a renewal of the Treaty on spring 2018 . &quot;
for S@@ DA the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer has not been reached for an opinion .
chocolate tables spread the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut is built in collaboration with Hu@@ g the chocolate tablets . &quot;
the possibility to place the logo was conducted two years ago with the start of collaboration with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .
in long @-@ haul flights the customers of First Class with treats from the Con@@ f@@ ery Spr@@ ün@@ gli will be pampered in the Business Class nas@@ al passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i von Lin@@ dt and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i by Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .

nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; in the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gically because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ s years , for the 90 @-@ years Gr@@ unge era ( as the Vor@@ den@@ ker David W@@ ain and Michael Sho@@ wal@@ ter the Sk@@ et@@ ch Com@@ edy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV three years ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , Amy Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to greater things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as a franchise , it feels as if the time was short . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not only because of his absurd Hum@@ or ( it contained a original story for a speaking d@@ ose of vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by getting sti@@ ff at the core of the g@@ ags , actors in middle age play vacc@@ inated children who will grow , they still produce the im@@ possibility to win the last part of the Wit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adult who are now grown adults is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the found@@ ries , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker @-@ Films of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; &quot; ( &quot; The Hand , which looked the cradle ) . &quot;
&quot; at one point st@@ agn@@ bert a character through an Apple @-@ Power@@ Book , some In@@ line Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not yet forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ e@@ au ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not yet lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is yet another crazy P@@ lot , which is involved in Ronald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Sho@@ wal@@ ter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
as always the ex@@ classes are the best part of the franchise .
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , the Matt D@@ illons Sub@@ li@@ ppen@@ berger of &quot; singles , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; they are the moments of accidental madness that could make this franchise like a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until it reaches what I &apos;ll show as its logical conclusion : Tw@@ enty Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the gang of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; at Amazon now remembers a different kind of nostal@@ gia : to the rev@@ itali@@ zation of the Cold War by &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic B@@ lon@@ de &quot; and even on &quot; G@@ low &quot; with its east @-@ against @-@ West ring class . &quot;
&quot; by Brian G@@ ate@@ wood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka created com@@ edy with Rh@@ ys Thomas as director , a found TV series with the two poli@@ c@@ emen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , which fight for truth , athe@@ ism and the way of Marxism @-@ Lenin@@ ism . &quot;
the main rolls - a hard @-@ ot@@ ten@@ er Gregor and an ide@@ alistic Io@@ z@@ sef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alogs from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt become syn@@ ced to English .
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
&quot; there are some beautiful g@@ ags for watching ( the police spend time to watch chess on TV , as Americans are doing it with football ) . &quot;
&quot; and the list of famous speakers - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Re@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ fty Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - takes out the voice for a decent game . &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective &quot; is involved so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a des@@ perate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer who carries a Re@@ agan mask , is included - that it often happens like a single . &quot;
&quot; for six long episodes it moves , and the com@@ edy isn &apos;t fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ra@@ de Det@@ ective , &quot; which was reduced to a lower length , his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p S@@ ati@@ re could be better delivered as Gregor and Io@@ z@@ sef again and again the American Embassy , whose lobby has always occupied by two big men who ent@@ ail a he@@ ap of bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the sophisticated communist audience is that the western culture can make everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black @-@ ald @-@ Ba@@ ar circle , in Rot@@ tw@@ eil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen , and Stuttgart numerous objects were per@@ secuted , like the Public Pro@@ secutor Kon@@ stanz held on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 alleg@@ ations were arrested between 25 years and 77 years and already en@@ acted on arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; the officials put greater quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , as well as several hundred thousand Euros . &quot;
at the same raid in Italy two people were arrested .
against the two susp@@ ects Italians there were German Ar@@ rest War@@ rant .
the two will probably be delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bav@@ arian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
overall there were over 300 poli@@ c@@ emen in use .
&quot; the members of the ma@@ fia will be accused of drug crimin@@ ality , heavy violence , attempted murder and rob@@ bery and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; already since summer 2016 , the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office determined against the organised drug trading in the South of Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the pro@@ secut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , an infectious exchange and the investig@@ ator of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ tw@@ eil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
therefore the large amount was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .
&quot; in particular , the investigations took back primarily by Italian nationality with respect to the Italian ma@@ fia . &quot;
&quot; also a incident on 27 May in Hü@@ gen@@ dered , at which early in the morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , is likely to go to the ban@@ de account . &quot;
ways complain big gaps in the foreig@@ ner register
&quot; data of citizens , who should not arise &quot; &quot; : one report says that the foreig@@ ner register in Germany has significant shortcomings . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this lead to partly grave mis@@ decisions in asylum methods . &quot;
&quot; the authorised for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen mode , has made aware of a media report on large gaps in the country &apos;s country register . &quot;
&quot; defects in the there registered data could result in asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations &quot; to some serious failure , &quot; warned that in an analysis that is the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the Register , there are according to 10 million people with foreign nationality , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by about 600 foreigners in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not sufficiently well maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; by people who have long been no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and in which register should no longer emerge . &quot;
&quot; faul@@ ty data inser@@ ts can substantially dec@@ eler@@ ate processes , &quot; &quot; says it to the report . &quot;
statistics on emigr@@ ate people are considered to be non @-@ EU citizens who would not have to travel .
&quot; such false developments led , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with foreigners , is said therefore in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the federal government seems to send back to Italy with the age of 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they travelled from there . &quot;
&quot; this relates out of an internal paper of the Federal Ministry of Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BAM@@ F ) , reports the &quot; &quot; New O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker newspaper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to this paper , the BAM@@ F lead such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , practically no longer possible , the newspaper was on the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees of the EU @-@ State to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a refugee travels to another EU country , this state can send it to the country @-@ country . &quot;
&quot; the following is now : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity of families with older children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the recording and property of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ r@@ t@@ HR ) hold these promises for adequate .
other EU states would res@@ hip refugees within the framework of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; an active political spokes@@ person in the Bundestag in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critici@@ zed this decision : &quot; families with children threaten the lack of conditions in the Italian asylum system and a haz@@ ard of the child living . &quot;
two @-@ second result scored
a total of 220 lit@@ res of blood of the people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach are already available for other people .
&quot; at least from the twelve citizens , which were awarded on Friday . &quot;
&quot; with all Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who has now distributed 50 lit@@ res of blood with his now 100 contributions . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , the community at the meeting of the council is the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous as our body is laid out for it and we have the Spen@@ cer respect that their blood made available to foreigners , still un@@ selfish , &quot; underlined the Mayor of Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood@@ thir@@ st helps several people , explained the cir@@ cus duc@@ tor of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Ma@@ isen@@ bacher , because the preser@@ ves will dis@@ integrate into its constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood sp@@ y . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Ma@@ isen@@ bacher reported by the actions conducted in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ators , &quot; said the DR@@ K district . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change in the theatre house has been led to higher number of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; previously , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ beer are among the multi@@ f@@ ren@@ s and were awarded for 50 m@@ illed blood donations . &quot;

the Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
the Bank of England is expected to announce that the interest rates remain unchanged after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation the spec@@ ulations of inflation .
&quot; the Bank of England warned that economic growth &quot; &quot; remains &quot; &quot; as they maintained the interest rates on family income in the middle of a strengthened print . &quot;
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the bank agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % , with less members a rise in this month because weak economic growth has weak@@ ened the support of an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly report , the Bank reduced its growth prospects for 2017 in 1.7 % and for 2018 on 1,6 % and warned that the pressure on fiscal income would continue to increase , while inflation is expected to rise to almost 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it was sign@@ alized that in the next few years Z@@ inser@@ tions would be necessary to breed by the Bre@@ xit , and she said that the borro@@ wing would have to rise more than expected on the financial markets . &quot;
members also voted to withdraw a part of the Mam@@ mut gli@@ des that was published one year after Bre@@ xit .
&quot; it will require time for finance plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks over the next February , although it is expected that they will provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central prognosis of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in short , since the pressure on the real income of households will continue to reduce consumption . &quot;
&quot; the interest rate repeated that &quot; &quot; a certain imp@@ lication of monetary policy &quot; &quot; to the cooling of inflation and a &quot; &quot; greater &quot; &quot; extent would be required than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank said , however , that increases &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the growth forecasts of the Bank for this and next year are projected compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % in May .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in the year 2018 .
the pound fell according to these messages against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.@@ 4 % to 1.@@ 11 euro .
&quot; the decision to no change come after , after the recent dis@@ continued growth rates have increased the increasing expectations on a shar@@ pen@@ raise , and GDP in the second quarter has increased to 0.@@ 3 % in the previous three months . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to recover by 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will be easy to recover after the bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent in@@ flow report provided little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by a rising inflation and low wages , as the ti@@ ghtening first becomes worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy cannot be prevented in the next few years , but she added that wages will become apparent at the end of their three @-@ year forec@@ asting . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also reinforced by increasing demand for British goods , which is attribut@@ able to the weak pounds , which will compens@@ ate for a part of lower consumption spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision came from a year after lowering the interest rates on 0.@@ 25 % in the last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the sound . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will probably last four years until this will reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the previous judgment of the bank to the interest rates , the reputation was increased after a shar@@ pen@@ raise , because inflation acceler@@ ates the pressure on hard @-@ mounted households , with three political decision @-@ makers in July a rise to 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; inflation is decreased last month by 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2,@@ 6 % , although the bank said that this was expected and to attract them in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the crossing in relation to its target of 2 % should be &quot; entirely &quot; from the weak Po@@ unds .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ agne , Director at Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ ker , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline of s@@ wap R@@ ates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive as the len@@ ders would look great to shops , and end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly well for those in which the existing de@@ als exp@@ ires and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( The National Health Service ) is said to prescri@@ be a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people . &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transformed &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight before the High Court against financing the medicine in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that a pre @-@ risk prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection from around 86 percent , now by health services via a first three @-@ year study of estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a judgment of the Supreme Court of Justice last year , that the N@@ HS had authority to pay for the Pr@@ EP despite the claim that local authorities should finance him . &quot;
&quot; the official published on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England @-@ Chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) described this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ ield will be the first to allow the registration of people and other clinics will follow in October , before it will be in all over England in April 2018 . &quot;
predic@@ tive prophy@@ la@@ xis ( Pr@@ EP ) is a result of HIV prescribed medicines to be taken prior to sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that Pr@@ EP reduces the HIV transfer to infection @-@ endangered significantly .
taking the Pr@@ EP in front of the intercourse means that just enough drugs in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .
&quot; to those who come for treatment in question , co@@ il or bis@@ ex@@ ual men , Trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV @-@ positive partners that were not treated successfully . &quot;
&quot; clinics are suitable participants identifying the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status will not be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
individuals who live in England and registered with a doctor &apos;s doctor can also register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will signed £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract for the delivery of the drugs in this week after an international competitive investment .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of the Pr@@ EP by how clinical evidence is collected , as it is implemented in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should be the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
&quot; it is another milestone in the more than three decades continuing progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ orah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; in particular , when it is targeted at vulnerable and endangered people , the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic . &quot;
&quot; from September to people suffering from high HIV risk access to this N@@ HS funded attempt to develop a new instrument that is really controlled individually and not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence Hig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority has to be done now that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV . &quot;
&quot; now , since the Pr@@ EP @-@ Test@@ medicine was created , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected persons . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ dg@@ son , Schatten @-@ minister@@ ial gifts , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the Pr@@ EP process is subject to monthly delays and hesit@@ ant implementation through the government . &quot;
the evidence show how transforming this drug as part of our approach to HIV infection can be and can end the transmission of this life changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of Pr@@ EP .
&quot; now it is important that this study is done as soon as possible all over the country to help people protect HIV infected , and that they will contribute to the ending of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
the big life live : mezz@@ anine and clever designer tricks have turned these little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ unk from a large house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to a Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it &apos;s a test@@ ament to the new design that Jo@@ anne did not have un@@ packed their bags and sold their bags .
&quot; before that , I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger space , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I searched for something that was comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and she had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I have fallen in love with them and made a quote on that day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square footage was completely rebuilt . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a snow@@ y layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Jo@@ anne @-@ storage space and a mezz@@ anine to best use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose she instruc@@ ted the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill , which was 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home not only a development , but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms over@@ each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezz@@ anine in which you could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the hand@@ ing .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the spaces so quickly , that they were fl@@ acked with each other without having to pick up . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but to define the steel so that he had the right amount for the function above or below . &quot;
&quot; this arrangement made it possible to place Er@@ fan , two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama . &quot;
for the mezz@@ anine looks a classic cl@@ assy sky@@ light made by Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us across the glam@@ orous living area .
&quot; mir@@ r@@ ored gold @-@ furniture , sil@@ ber@@ ne acc@@ ents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mir@@ rors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short basket is mir@@ r@@ ored to take him longer work . &quot;
the kitchen feels like a window in another room .
at the entrance mir@@ r@@ ored units accommodate all the seating and the glasses of Jo@@ anne .
&quot; due to the perception of a glam@@ orous space , the beauty of the living room can connect the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
&quot; the special thing about this is , that it is a gar@@ net door . &quot;
&quot; a bit of engineering went out there , &quot; says Er@@ fan of the st@@ ahl@@ reinforced , fur@@ nit@@ ed M@@ DF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is subject to object , so it is when you up@@ slide the door very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell floor space - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a rudi@@ mental form , a real estate bro@@ ker will enter and create a calculation based on the height size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high quality materials which give the space its luxury advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional relationship in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you do not love yourself in the electrical socket in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment itself can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of somewhat default in something completely aston@@ ishment .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave this . &quot;
brothers are fighting for a 500 million US dollars property
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a meditation because of one of the biggest property imperial Vict@@ ori@@ as worth over 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton football club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . he led him to the Supreme Court of Justice , to clarify how their property and their business shall be divided . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court of Justice . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street , Col@@ ling@@ wood . &quot;
there the family West@@ co Je@@ ans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retailers .
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now comprises offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt . Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; according to an agreement with their departed father , Col@@ in - from Paul as &quot; main operator and the dominating personality &quot; is described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
court record says that Col@@ in is owned by 3@@ 16 million dollars and Paul in the value of € 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul as a problem .
&quot; the orders proposed by Col@@ in proposed will mark him with what I held for the best properties , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first affair . &quot;
last Friday he took place after several failed recru@@ iters the first hearing of the Supreme Court of Justice .
the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - from which Col@@ in as Paul claims to be excluded .
&quot; argu@@ ably argued that this is not true , but raises Paul before , some possessions of in@@ competent . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ id@@ av@@ it , which was filed by Col@@ in , he says he hope to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs will rise in the case with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ id@@ av@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports of companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cr@@ amer , and with leading lawyers , including All@@ an My@@ ers , Q@@ C , and from both sides and law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her died husband Luigi were both Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and delic@@ acy stores from the late 1950 @-@ er years and bought a business in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early seven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used security to buy the Col@@ ling@@ wood property , in the col@@ on of the first Je@@ ans@@ ing family . &quot;
&quot; in his last years , Col@@ in says he was &quot; &quot; in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . &quot;
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , did their property to pass on to her children . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted to land the brothers in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , whereby Col@@ in claimed that Mark paid $ 10 million in leaving the company to Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke and Mark , &quot; &quot; says Paul &quot; &quot; about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept herself back even though he was a former AF@@ L management board and after a biography from 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV stars .
Fair@@ fax Media took contact with Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their attor@@ neys .
&quot; only Col@@ in rep@@ lied with SMS to say &quot; I can really not say much , &quot; because the case before the courts may be . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and withdraw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in the middle of 2016 Col@@ in wrote a letter to the court that he tries to fulfill the demands of his brother .
&quot; our father would not have wanted that Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he and added that he still hope for a solution . &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our issue will be resolved in the near future by the courts , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
tr@@ umps of new staff is planning to restrict the media &apos;s in@@ consistency of the president .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; poli@@ tico reports that the new staff leader of the White House is planning to restrict the information flow to President Tr@@ ump , including reports of the news media - in hope to keep the head on a more equ@@ itable circuit . &quot;
here is a piece by re@@ porter Jos@@ h D@@ aw@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new staff leader of the White House , joining his first working day with leading employees , he set a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ umps &apos;s White House , which he wants to fix : bad information that come into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly told the staff that information on him should flow - whether on paper or in brie@@ f@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ aming tr@@ ump by monitoring its media di@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ umps &apos;s relationship to television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV show is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if candidate Tr@@ ump was anno@@ yed because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former election consultant Sam Nun@@ berg in February towards Poli@@ tico . &quot;
&quot; Poli@@ ti@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote to the time that &quot; the key to keep tr@@ umps Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaign officials , to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady level of praise . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tr@@ umps Twitter @-@ habit have ever been &quot; under control &quot; , &quot; is ridiculous . &quot;
perhaps this campaign officials know what we don &apos;t know - that Tr@@ umps T@@ we@@ ets could not contain even more f@@ itters without their interventions .
we will probably never know something about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his staff had made it a few times , to keep anger from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; however , nobody has consistently been able to prevent Tr@@ ump controversy . &quot;
&quot; a part of the problem is that people in a White House put together from competitive parties , always try to move their own agenda by promoting Tr@@ ump &apos;s material that could possibly promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; pol@@ tico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants , the President for strategic reasons of du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
&quot; this was an example , which was described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher : &quot;
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump @-@ officials say that Tr@@ ump like a volcano can react to negative press sections , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he figure out where these come from . &quot;
&quot; this happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of mali@@ cious copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet Pro@@ voc@@ ate@@ urs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy head office in K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; &quot; the source behind a pile of &quot; le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was banned permanently from Twitter because he had no concrete evidence whatsoever , or that he vo@@ iced wrong accus@@ ations in the past or vo@@ ke her . &quot;
Tr@@ ump read the article and started to ask staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the Secretary General Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the pap@@ er@@ work . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager as a pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his impul@@ sive Self , and his advis@@ ors still seek influence . &quot;
these un@@ changing factors make wa@@ &apos;s mission very difficult .
Me@@ ist@@ searched Cri@@ cher will get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will pray and hoped . &quot;
the police in Europe send in this summer ( virtual ) post@@ cards to dangerous criminal on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested s@@ words are not well @-@ known , evidence of the population will be hoped and pray . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday from the action that follows the &quot; EU Most Wan@@ ted &quot; -@@ Adv@@ ent Calendar of winter .
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting places are hiding place , called it by Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 post@@ cards for selected criminal off@@ ences from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 there has been the website www.@@ e@@ dic@@ um , more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
36 of the on @-@ line coun@@ ties were previously arrested and at least 11 of them due to hints after the publication on the website .
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to &apos; million@@ aire @-@ series &apos;
some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again united with a determined trav@@ eller on the war of war that negotiated one by the municipality of extended dit@@ ch in order to claim a field in front of their man@@ sions .
&quot; the travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy road from Soli@@ h@@ ull , which is called &quot; &quot; Million@@ är@@ s series &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they have brought back horses , babies and an army of transport , after they had been thrown out only in May , without gr@@ asp@@ ed out by any of the Council to prevent their failures . &quot;
the tactical group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their cars by a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; desert inhabitants have aff@@ licted the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull , who said it is &quot; useless , to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous residents said , &quot; They were moved to the Monday night after they were sent to the pas@@ sers by Bentley He@@ ath . &quot;
&quot; the Council needs to be forced by shame to implement , as he was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived last night , probably today more . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my com@@ plac@@ ements , if the Council can not even stop it . &quot;
&quot; people who didn &apos;t want to be called said , &quot; It is ridiculous ; we just saw the last round of these travelers to be lo@@ oted from another round . &quot;
&quot; this time , the numbers have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person in the Council of Soli@@ h@@ ull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of a unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Stre@@ et@@ s@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to enable them to continue as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our proof collection , it is very important that as many inhabitants get an anti @-@ social or criminal conduct in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must check , when we present our case . &quot;
from Birken@@ hof is the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Birken@@ hof it will be the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stad@@ ts is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the hotel bir@@ ch through the then ambience operating company , to 13 April 2014 , approximately 30 000 nights were lost per year and also recei@@ pts by the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the number of refugees , which came to the County , the hotel building of the store as a collective accommodation , which was controversial to controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the territory as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the council .
&quot; but in particular , Freu@@ den@@ ko &apos;s Ober@@ may@@ ors Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious interested parties in the house . &quot;
he should be right .
&quot; the group of Lu@@ isen@@ yi , with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern acquired the former Hotel bir@@ ch at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star @-@ Plus category under the name of Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ städ@@ ter object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ min@@ ers and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the earlier Hotel Birken@@ hof prior to the entrance , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear , what extensive renovation work is made . &quot;
&quot; the so@@ ils have been demol@@ ished , ceilings to part un@@ built , old bath@@ tu@@ bs from the rooms removed . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a lovely place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ ens in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the black @-@ style style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built @-@ in . &quot;
&quot; everything was later &quot; &quot; nice bourgeois &quot; &quot; how Thomas Sch@@ er expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a jewelry piece . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are included in the facilities . &quot;
&quot; you would not want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bath , but already at an up@@ scale downtown , empha@@ sizes Sch@@ ther . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , is set to set up a wide range , outlines the check @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; individual holiday makers , groups or business@@ men should feel comfortable in the hotel . &quot;
talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourist Board Michael Kr@@ ause he already managed to become so scar@@ let .
the noti@@ ons of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment is asked , Thomas Sch@@ er wants not to define himself exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under one million euros , he expects . &quot;
&quot; external installations are also brought to the front , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , a large terrace comes from the restaurant which is publicly available . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Mon@@ key : us @-@ Special acqu@@ ires Grand Jury a
in the Russia @-@ affair by US President Donald Tr@@ ump shall have appointed Special Jury Robert Mu@@ eller after a report called a so @-@ called Grand Jury .
&quot; in recent weeks the panel was recorded in recent weeks , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; with an appeal to the cause of trusted persons . &quot;
the paper made the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller has expanded and intensified .
the sender CN@@ N reported it already gives first pre@@ inv@@ itations to the Gre@@ mi@@ um in connection with a meeting between the m@@ umps and Russian Ombud@@ sper@@ son .
U.S. intelligence services acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin since longer time to engage in the presidential election in 2016 .
Mu@@ eller studied if there were agreements between tr@@ umps of election team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men should stand in the election campaign as a consultant of the Republi@@ can . &quot;
&quot; report@@ edly , Mu@@ eller also recorded more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment among the magni@@ fier . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote a few weeks ago that the special brie@@ fing did not lie in the centre for a few weeks , and finding the accus@@ ation if the president in the wake of the affair may have hin@@ dered the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; the main task of Grand Law@@ ys , is to examine and decide the present evidence in possible accidents , and to decide whether charges are charged . &quot;
Grand Law@@ ys are therefore also called the Count &apos;s Cham@@ bers .
&quot; mostly they are switched on , when it is a larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure will always be closed behind closed doors .
&quot; the panel may also be switched from the Public Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office , to invite people to galvan@@ izing under E@@ id . &quot;
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , CN@@ N were already exhibited inv@@ itations that revol@@ ve around Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
individuals who were involved in the meeting were called on a statement and called it in the report .
&quot; moreover , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. there were also tr@@ umps consultants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his dam , Paul Man@@ a@@ fort . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ wing spoke on Thursday evening in U.S. television , that the installation show that Mu@@ eller would not be timi@@ d in his work and that he should be necessary quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up at the end to decide on the survey of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the de@@ composition of the atro@@ pha was the beginning of a new phase in research and a new reason to concern President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , President on Thursday evening spent a speech in West Virginia in order to portra@@ y the Russia affair as a campaign against its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia @-@ story is a total invention , &quot; said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; the Democrats will give the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about what they are talking about . &quot;
his special consultant T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in an opinion which he did not know about the suspension of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but this also works usually in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House advocate all measures that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
the former F@@ BI leader James Com@@ ey told three times that not to be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to accept that something changed , it meant that it was in the statement . &quot;
&quot; but Mu@@ eller had only been used , after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had folded . &quot;
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , alleg@@ ations were loud against Tr@@ ump , he will hin@@ der the judiciary . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ ey told him in June before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump has asked him to adjust the investigation against the former national security advisor Michael Fl@@ ynn . &quot;
the President is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the representation of U.S. media , the White House gathered material against special @-@ conductors and its employees . &quot;
the worst spec@@ ulations of whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller would like to release .
&quot; unlike an independent term of Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair , has rejected a position later in which he can theoretically be fired at D@@ rän@@ gen of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators held on Thursday &apos; law@@ makers , after which the special no@@ isse@@ urs could no longer be dis@@ missed . &quot;
Antar@@ c@@ tica : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in the Antar@@ c@@ tica
&quot; in the west ant@@ ar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the close @-@ fold size of Berlin is solved by the Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is . &quot;
he shared the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener Institute for Polar and marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the spread over a B@@ illion tons of heavy and 5@@ 800 square kilometers , now north and will probably need two , three years until he mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometers of length and a width of up to 50 kilometers one of the largest ice ones , the researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for people from him .
how far the climate change has played a role in the demo@@ lition of ice is unclear .
&quot; however , for about 30 years there have been a series of unusual break @-@ breaks of ice ch@@ iev@@ es in the region , the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) is in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this can be combined with warming . &quot;
the broken col@@ oss had so far been part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is so far .
Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is swi@@ ms over the sea and is fed by large gl@@ aci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks off on a regular basis .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula .
north of this treasure was the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rup@@ ting a few years ago .
&quot; a complete shot is broken there , AW@@ I researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of things that also the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is is in danger , because the pre@@ tend c@@ annon has never withdrawn as far as it is . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ic@@ e@@ plate stand under tension and can be sm@@ ashed if in a key place a piece will fail . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is and ic@@ e@@ berg will not increase the sea level , as it is floating on the water and ice as much water as it results in the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ap@@ ron leads to that the gl@@ aci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only in small dimensions , writes the British research project to observe the Antar@@ ctic ( MID@@ AS ) . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is is based on AW@@ I @-@ details with almost 50 000 square kilometres the fourth largest Sch@@ el@@ fe@@ is of the Antar@@ c@@ tica .
&quot; on the road from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front @-@ edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it will break up regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and no direct connection to climate change is aware , the ic@@ e@@ plate comes now at a approximate position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most extensive withdrawal since the beginning of the record , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; under scientists , under scientists , whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sh@@ el@@ fe@@ is would be able to grow back or back in the long term , &quot; &quot; his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last decades .
&quot; even if this researchers did not withdraw the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg on climate change , so in the past decades many ch@@ ic@@ ebre@@ akers of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula are broken . &quot;
this long lap@@ se of the Antar@@ c@@ tica covers the direction of South America .
&quot; according to data from the British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice @-@ surface of the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has gone back around 28@@ ,000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
&quot; to decline , temperature rose has contributed . &quot;
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic peninsula has passed over 50 years , around three degrees warmer and t@@ apped in the areas where the temperature is fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy free areas , the CD@@ U calls to step out of the employer association to be more attractive . &quot;
only shortly before the summer break the Kre@@ ist@@ ag announced 41 new jobs in the administration .
&quot; more than 1100 employees and officials work for the county administration in M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
now 17 trainees now have their first working day behind them .
the teachers in the circle are obviously very popular .
about 6@@ 20 applications stayed for this year to be noted .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle lacks a staff to cope with the Ascen@@ ded requirements and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still no vac@@ ant positions in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
searched among other things doctors and engineers as well as forces of general management .
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG initiative and sent the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
the management should work out according to the wish of the parties &quot; a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to cover not only short @-@ term needs for professionals , but future @-@ oriented of application scar@@ city , is to say . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should be oriented towards the inside and outside , to show concrete measures for cross @-@ clim@@ bers and include a training offensive , calling CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this already sounds like a good approach .
&quot; for the circle has to do with personal problems , which you didn &apos;t know earlier . &quot;
other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is given by a ver@@ right &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a high number of employees , the disease or age @-@ conditions come from the service . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter nations , Leader of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common application with his party . &quot;
he was long ago already in Kre@@ ist@@ ag for a lazy surprise when he asked the human @-@ charge public in question and the other parties are amazing .
&quot; &quot; &quot; peoples want to be reviewed all the possibilities that enable a res@@ ignation from the municipal employer . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come here at short notice to a satisfactory solution , the county administration should asp@@ ire with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f &quot; , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U is trying to pay the CD@@ U , the employees and officials better than to see the tari@@ at for the Public Service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently exactly required , yields or more money there is only when you move into a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
only a few weeks ago new premises had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new pro@@ stitutes .
not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers have governor Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ ler Martin Richter has a problem : they have too little personnel .
Italy sharp@@ ens the tone to an NGO migrants
&quot; &quot; &quot; Italy has called NGOs to use the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they should not continue if they do not comply with new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not submit a new Code of Conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Tur@@ iner La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had ra@@ zed by a boat of the German aid organisation &apos; youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their team worked effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has been in operation only for one year , declined to the detailed alleg@@ ations of the Italian Pro@@ secutor Amb@@ ro@@ gio Carto@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life remains our top priority . so we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and li@@ f@@ le zone , &quot; the organization said in an opinion on social media . &quot;
&quot; we can all accus@@ ations that are currently raised , only when we collected all the information and to judge the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had the boat of &quot; &quot; youth Ret@@ tet &quot; &quot; the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is believed that its occupation stri@@ pe din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , that they can be delivered directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gler will be able to use them again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such coincidence , it was alleged to be just 1,3 miles from the Libyan border , according to the Act of the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Act , whose content of Italian media was published . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected , controlled by the authority of the Italian Coast , the li@@ b@@ ail@@ out in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; among the Code of Conduct , boats like the I@@ u@@ v@@ enta must above all have an Italian police officers on board that monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far been expressed to hold the code : save the Children , MO@@ AS from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; it was on Thursday that the new rules were regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; significant changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their b@@ ail@@ out campaigns . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organization doctors without borders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the b@@ ail@@ out measures in Italy , has declined in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we began to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he gave plans for more talks with Libyan citizens in this month about economic development initiatives and with Ch@@ ad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants that can leave those countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;

&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious business , has become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gar@@ ages . &quot;
they have also recognized the first Bundes@@ li@@ ga@@ ver@@ a who are increasingly involved in this field .
&quot; the Beg@@ f@@ l Wolfs@@ burg , later followed , the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently followed the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , founded in mid July an e @-@ sport department and took two professionals for the computer play FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to ama@@ ze new young audiences for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says Executive Board of Jo@@ chen Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; he is certain that on these train , there are still many associations . &quot;
&quot; next weekend , the Football World@@ verband FIFA will organize the first &quot; &quot; Interactive Club World Cup &quot; &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , in addition to Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Germain or the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified . &quot;

&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years old , that young people will still go into the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the associations tried , all possible markets , especially the Asian , to conquer . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the E @-@ Sport computer games like &quot; League Of Le@@ gends &quot; , &quot; Dot@@ A 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or just the soccer simulation of FIFA on competition level . &quot;
&quot; long ago , as in the normal sport also , Li@@ gen is established , in which the pros compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in A@@ sians , E @-@ Sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the performance is certainly unusual . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ ous has long faced a question about the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , e @-@ Sport is a sport because it is peti@@ tual and many biological and physical responses which can be found in classical sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress interactions , hormonal changes . &quot;
&quot; besides , there is cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a quick reaction capacity . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also exercise their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the f@@ itte player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; rob@@ bery also sees problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform at Online Games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were lacking . &quot;
positive stresses the scientists the high inclusive effect of e @-@ sport .
&quot; players are on the way international , which is like a big global family , there are no intercultural shirts . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) tells the E @-@ Sport a rapid growth ahead .
&quot; in 2016 , it has been implemented in Germany 50 million euros , mainly about advertising , sponsor@@ ing and great tournaments . &quot;
sales remained at 130 million in three years .
&quot; against the nearly 2,@@ 4 billion euros of the soccer league , this is very little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport &quot; is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice ho@@ ckey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultants . &quot;
international are many countries already further .
big markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ Bas@@ ket@@ ball@@ ers Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ u@@ star Alex Rodri@@ guez participate in the US team N@@ RG e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ashton Kut@@ cher is investing in e @-@ sport competition Uni@@ kr@@ n .
also in Europe does a lot of things too .
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport was introduced as educational , says F@@ rob@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and in France , the football @-@ state associations of the D@@ utt are now oblig@@ ated to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany back , &quot; explains V@@ ote Board of Rö@@ tt@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; just fall in nostal@@ gia , and clear the old times , is now no longer sufficient . &quot;
&quot; it is about keeping the tradition of the association , but the company is at the same time to align it on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; also means D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; there you can not stick to it , that only when football everything remains as it was always . &quot;

Michelle Carter because of the lyrics that Con@@ rad Roy is pushing for su@@ icide
a woman from Massachusetts was condemned into two and a half years because she encourages her boyfriend and calls to su@@ icide .
&quot; Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their conviction after G@@ it@@ tern and five years were exposed to currency . &quot;
&quot; Carter was condemned in June for the trans@@ lu@@ cent kill@@ ings of Con@@ rad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
the father of Roy commented on Thursday during the hearing : &quot; my family is im@@ mortal .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Carter was allowed to stay free up to the vocation .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her representatives were argu@@ ing that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a psych@@ ic disease . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red p@@ ants and a cre@@ me@@ colored bl@@ ouse , Carter has stood with tears in his eyes , with folded hands and down west@@ ward eyes when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; their actions have turned Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the Ombud@@ sper@@ son to the court . &quot;
she ended his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility taken , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has no re@@ mor@@ ue . &quot;
&quot; but Car@@ rier &apos;s lawyer said , &quot; &quot; There is a &quot; &quot; terrible circum@@ stance , which they are totally de@@ pl@@ orable . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity or even their spiritual disease have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a pro@@ secutor las an explanation by Ro@@ ys mother Lyn@@ n Roy , said that there is &quot; no day on which I mo@@ urn the loss of my beloved Son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I move with everything . I try , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity with us , for his sisters , to be there . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said that she was &quot; &quot; per@@ secuted &quot; &quot; by the realization that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or be a aun@@ t for his children . &quot;
&quot; not to have this single person with whom I was together since my birth , is a pain that I will always remember for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , as there is no law in Massachusetts where it makes a crime to commit a murder to su@@ icide . &quot;
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from a coal oxid@@ ation in a vehicle .
&quot; the case attracted national attention to him , after Car@@ rier &apos;s statements revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hanging on , spring from a building , first confess yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent to her death during the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his su@@ icide wrote them : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; All that you must do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . &quot;
&quot; judge Mon@@ iz said that Carter has sought to pay attention through the death of Roy , and ruled that they should benefit from the case by some press . &quot;
the case has shared the legal opinion .
&quot; to the few who defended Carter , Amanda Kno@@ x , who was condemned in Italy for murder in her British room@@ mate before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times commentary a comment : &quot; Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua OF me : learn from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua asked for me at the Audi Cup as captain is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern will not make a big season at the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner .
&quot; something that was different on his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua for me immediately , even if the extra gar@@ ment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but since far and wide on the second day of Audi C@@ ups , no Philipp Lah@@ m and also no Manuel Neu@@ er was to see , he made himself the bond between him and his arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach has not announced it , &quot; told the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner after his first use as Bavaria captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the one could have been able to run better than at the 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign of the coach was not possible to interpret for me as well .
&quot; not the eight year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al was chosen by youth activists , deb@@ tors , and especially from the holiday made professionals existing C @-@ El@@ f as a guide , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar@@ l are distributed at the dearest one to those who want to think much in mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to step the heritage of L@@ ame , a small extra @-@ motivation can only be good . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed , &quot; This is what you want as a player : responsibility take . &quot;
on Wednesday the 22 @-@ year @-@ old as a mini @-@ lam@@ m over the field .
&quot; right back , this is his position , the white Bin@@ de on the arm did her rest . &quot;
and at all she played for me in this starting point as the one who may take the rod even best in his hand .
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to ste@@ er the un@@ played tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had the view of the whole , while many others were involved with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vid@@ al so that she &apos;s missing his missing fitness ( worked hardly ) ; Renato San@@ ches to tie , on the devil , come out to the achievements of Asia &apos;s journey ( also only conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ ver didn &apos;t seem to negative in their first appearance in Bavaria . &quot;
all after all , this worked really well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ myself , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both agi@@ es@@ ed sovereign . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ occupied Nap@@ oli storm was often difficult , and I also tried to successfully develop a few times in the game of the game . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy gave the fact that the result was &quot; &quot; not the way we expected . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; shift , temp@@ o change : &quot; for this style I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria is still living for the new , one saw afterwards to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy gave not one or two , but determines six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ ono for a few cr@@ ush statements in the back of his new fellow @-@ players .
&quot; there he heard of Sü@@ le a very interesting phrase , &quot; &quot; What is going on here , I now noticed . &quot;
in case of Bavaria you simply have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he does not have to teach the new one . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ wre@@ ak Minister : economics lo@@ om Wis@@ sings
&quot; it has often been irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) , nor Economic Affairs in Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate . &quot;
this is demonstrated in office after more than one year in which the new Economic Minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and corporations from the region speak at T V @-@ request from a change in economic policy - and bl@@ ends at the same time the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association Tri@@ ple Companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; Wis@@ sing takes up the wishes of the economy , the Lem@@ ke All has blocked . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around looks Nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the loop of the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au stands in the country list of the country all up .
&quot; in this year , the Ministry is hoping for a plan@@ ing process , to 2021 the building is right . &quot;
a role in the plans of the country also plays the west retreat of Tri@@ er who stands in the urgent need of the Federal Reserve plan .
&quot; if the goal was to put the track in December 2020 , Min@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann says the Min@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ us sees it a sign for regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Chamber of Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Tri@@ er asp@@ ires , as from Wis@@ sing , to boost the sales of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Palat@@ inate label to boost the sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing is an open ear for people who want to start a own firm , lo@@ osing the Chamber of Industry . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ skammer Tri@@ er sees in the new master @-@ bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says CEO Matthias Schwal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; planned is an premium of 1000 Euros for the component inspection and 2500 Euros , if graduates are self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; in the planned road building were quick facts to create , at the same time l@@ acked the country at the necessary staff , says Jan Bell auer , captain of the Chamber of Industry Tri@@ er . &quot;
&quot; from 56 new engineers , who wants to adjust the Wis@@ sing at regional mobility , have been occupied until 29 places until now . &quot;
the Chamber of Industry calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U spokes@@ vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf refers to calculations of the cemetery , the country invested more than EUR 20 million in terms of obtaining country roads as proposed . &quot;
Frank Nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country as it wants to fix the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
ern@@ els is further the previous broad@@ band structure in the country .
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had been rated the power supply in a I@@ HK survey only with the note note . &quot;
they compl@@ aining about the inter@@ c@@ iting Internet connections and downs .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Economic Affairs in E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sitting in the supervisory boards of the wind power plant Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke on April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already returned the field after four months due to in@@ consistency . &quot;
Audi aims to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face with a counter@@ reaction
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said that &quot; &quot; it is the opinion that &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , and related to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - diesel vehicles to for@@ bid or limit . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described companies as a recall .
European automotive manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; but the nit@@ rogen oxi@@ des , the diesel engines , are considered as car@@ cin@@ o@@ genic and can cause as@@ thma . &quot;
&quot; to install the costs for autom@@ akers , facilities to the neutr@@ alization of the diesel vehicles to be installed , take also to what it makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also being charged to pamp@@ er the powerful car companies and ignore signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies try to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called de@@ preci@@ ation devices that regulate emissions when a car was tested , but returning to normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees were charged by Volkswagen , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
last month the former manager of the ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the motor development of Audi was arrested in Germany .
&quot; the former manager , Zac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ ami@@ o , is Italian and is therefore not protected prior to delivery and could be placed in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year Audi was included in German criminal investigation into Volkswagen , after the authorities Audi accused a system to have installed the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request that was focused on the United States . &quot;
&quot; the inclusion of Audi to the investigation , Volkswagen is hard to strain : the luxury automobile manufacturers will be proportionate to the profit of Volkswagen . &quot;

Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ dill@@ o was temporarily one of the best published carto@@ on@@ ists , the Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es of his figures are his trademark . &quot;
also with 85 the Argent@@ inian is still working and works on a film .
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; Guillaume , Mor@@ dill@@ o was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
in the first years as an artist he proposed himself as a dra@@ wer for lucky post@@ cards - which he frustrated .
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after the ends in Lima , New York and Paris ended the breakthrough in the 60s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris &quot; and then also in the &quot; star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ dill@@ o found many fans .
again and again the artists are inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ dill@@ o @-@ figures cav@@ ort in drawings with the s@@ late Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , he is still sitting by the cartoon still on the drawing , works daily almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; calendar about calendar , puzzles , books for Gross and Klein , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush animals and watches find his dro@@ l@@ ish figures continue to find lots of spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his figures for six years .
&quot; the main person in the movie &quot; Crazy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los popular test@@ es , in his drawings - that has a thou@@ sand@@ al @-@ col@@ der as a counter @-@ player . &quot;
&quot; for the first time his figures in the 3D movie , the 2019 is to come to the film wall . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they are saying , it is strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ dill@@ o . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore , he is rather put on the TV series , which is produced like his original desig@@ nations , wor@@ dless . &quot;
lav@@ ender from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the lav@@ ender is rec@@ alled due to the im@@ movable conditions and due to illness @-@ borne insec@@ t , resulting in scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions , great head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , Expert of the CR@@ IE@@ PP@@ AM Institute in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the lav@@ ender in Provence was effectively je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed because the plant in recent years has caused the impact of climate change in spring , and much more in fall . &quot;
this has an effect on the life of lav@@ ender .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacterial , the d@@ warf @-@ thread , and with very dry weather there are many of it . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
lav@@ ender oil l@@ ures not only for vac@@ ation@@ ers ; it is also very popular for perf@@ ume and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ m said : &quot; rather than very long plant watches with a large number of flowers , we have minor , under@@ developed and either missing or weak@@ ened . &quot;
&quot; so , we have less parts with etheric oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered , are a better water distribution and the slo@@ wing of ev@@ ap@@ oration from the ground , but also the test of plants with a protective blend of sound and water and the development of varieties that are resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Ge@@ isa in the th@@ inn@@ ing@@ ian d@@ hö@@ n celebrates his 1200 @-@ year anniversary .
the Fes@@ th@@ öh@@ ep@@ point is Saturday and Sunday with a medi@@ a@@ eval period .

the assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico
the employees of the weekly Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met usually to check their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the State of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime to corrupt public officials and un@@ ceas@@ eless drug wars .
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about safety . &quot;
it has been told to them that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what they feel safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with shells , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; safety experts have written three words to a black@@ board at the front of the room : opponent , Neutr@@ al , ally . &quot;
&quot; you ask the re@@ porter to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and stomach upset . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gler , politicians , business@@ men , journalists , who are suspected of being on the secret list of government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest break from violence , and while throughout the country the cor@@ p@@ ses of the cor@@ p@@ ses are more and more journalists : at least 25 , since President Enri@@ que Pen@@ a N@@ ie@@ to took his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are standing by attacks and threats under Bundes@@ daten@@ schutz and so far there was at least seven deaths in seven countries . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her publisher and her inspir@@ er from Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , the co @-@ founder Javier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest flaw is to live in Mexico and be journalist , &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; its absence is felt deeply , although its presence exists everywhere - a large picture of Val@@ dez , which shows his medium @-@ finger with the word &quot; Justice , &quot; depends on the façade of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce building . two re@@ porters in the thir@@ ties , carry T @-@ shirts , who show his smiling face with spectac@@ les or his typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trau@@ ma , their nightmare , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although 2010 was established by the Pro@@ secutor &apos;s Office in order to edit the cases of journalists , this according to the committee regarding the protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of murder , each year with drug trafficking and organised crime , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely placed in court . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ tr@@ acked and even though the terrain is now more tra@@ it@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting about the discussion of safety little benefits , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very silly to squ@@ ander my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we know not that , mis@@ trust we all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15th , Val@@ dez left the newspaper of the newspaper Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in the provincial capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed just to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ olla was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; T@@ wel@@ ded River . &quot; &quot;
the cap was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two adults .
rum@@ ors tend to travel freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ mans arrest in last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , since rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a every day someone or several people will be shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of noted , two @-@ story mou@@ ths for drug lab@@ s that are bigger than many houses for the living . &quot;
&quot; remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace , &quot; if only a cart@@ el control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States has . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the fact that Val@@ dez has been aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce , broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ concep@@ tions contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February the release of a interview with Damas@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ on@@ au@@ ctions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may be anno@@ yed the children , presum@@ ed gang@@ members buy any copy of the output , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second fault was to force Val@@ dez , according to the conf@@ is@@ cation of another newspaper which had released the same story , leaving the country to its own safety . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues im@@ itate that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , it was impossible to run journalism without encounter@@ ing the do@@ w@@ ry problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; at the time , the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising participated . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter loved it to publish hard @-@ in investigations without fear of cens@@ orship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else to treat . &quot;
eight years after the formation of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for their coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez has won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs history , where ever it lead . &quot;
he had voluntarily made that he was afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug dealers in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento TV in the last October . &quot;
you have to take the task of taking you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
&quot; I do not want to ask , &quot; What have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce team mixed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who was cur@@ sing like a harbour workers , the friend who knew generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in their routine .
he always would carry his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Guay@@ n@@ abo , the bar opposite the office , go and sit there at the same table . &quot;
&quot; now , ask them : was his love for the routine for his destruction ? &quot;
&quot; his death has also forced her to question her own assumptions on how to do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they do not like it when you move with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their home and cross @-@ ways &quot; , &quot; to employ drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust our own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the trouble is , the editor of the Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real , that &quot; smell is a sense that can be dec@@ eived ... and then the thing with Javier has happened . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , such as he and others say , are no longer - just as not in Tam@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ is@@ oned mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home . &quot;
the landscape is constantly changing .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before has been known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside sought two poli@@ c@@ emen protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
&quot; they were commissioned by the provincial government , to protect the offices of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce in a four @-@ story building in a mid @-@ range area of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers , who referred to the Gover@@ nor himself . &quot;
&quot; it is months ago , since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain scenery where the drug gangs are actually under control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce has clicked on three main stories .
there was the assassination of the brother of the former famous box@@ ers Ju@@ lio Ces@@ ar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an Ex@@ pos@@ é to the government spending , which concentrated on the home of the Govern@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; and there was one group , which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the pro@@ secutor &apos;s office , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it came to pass , so it was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally on drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porter came from public records , that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy worker , who ruled the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( Pr@@ i ) , which ruled nearly all the century all political levels . &quot;
recently several Pr@@ i govern@@ ors have been accused of high @-@ cali@@ per cases of corruption .
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write over previous incidents in this pub , including one , in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man went to a military attack . &quot;
only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolum@@ ne of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the kidn@@ apping .
&quot; before we had already knew what happened &quot; , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nickname &quot; El FLACO &quot; because of its slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
&quot; the office of Val@@ dez was dedicated to storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers , dedicated to killing the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected , activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am R@@ ami@@ rez came a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the pro@@ secutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is its . &quot;
journalists all over the country have become vo@@ ci@@ zed by having written them in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on en@@ closures and buildings .
&quot; on this day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assassination of Val@@ dez , the authorities , to pronoun@@ ce journalists and to leave them , because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked that she is once again divided by the government , because it is worried that their anger has hurt their objectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime to participate in government officials and a uniform society . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; &quot; Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porter would not only be killed by drug gangs , but also on command of politicians and security forces organized with organised crime among a blan@@ ket . &quot;
&quot; over half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials , the media &quot; &quot; Ar@@ tic@@ ulo 19 &quot; &quot; has been assigned to journalists of the police and officials last year . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico @-@ minded you live , because they want you to keep the mouth , &quot; said R@@ ami@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
nobody for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Mary Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
&quot; your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Z@@ etas des Kart@@ ell , &quot; &quot; Here I am because of my reports . &quot;
a computer ta@@ stat@@ ur and ear@@ phones aside from their separated head .
&quot; some stores have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Nor@@ te is in the northern border @-@ state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assassination of the correspon@@ dents Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue on like El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo after the assassination of their director in 2004 did .
in 2010 the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ arez publicly announced the drug @-@ cart@@ els with an editorial page on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their homeland states or even out of the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they shall be hun@@ ted , as apparently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who want to stay away and continue working , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ome decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be po@@ ets , adm@@ its that the drug stores put it scar@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce stood on the side@@ walk before the office and drank beer , than once all their phones began to work . &quot;
a series of sho@@ ot@@ ings with band@@ ages and security guards near the bath@@ ed Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed t@@ ote .
the war has escal@@ ated as it was promised by a number of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the on @-@ board edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the front page was needed to change the next day .
Sir@@ ens he@@ ul@@ ts in the vicinity - a further s@@ late in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in readiness .
&quot; when they were afraid , they showed it not . &quot;
&quot; under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose medium @-@ finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff followed by Ri@@ o@@ do@@ ce followed its foot@@ steps . &quot;
&quot; how can you also think of it , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the tra@@ inee asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used targe@@ ting its enemies
at first sight it looks like a statue even if a terri@@ fying .
&quot; now , researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhin@@ ocer@@ os of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received that experts have described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even notice that his loved skin was bl@@ ush with red@@ dish , and they said they could have had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the magazine &quot; Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , &quot; referred to as &quot; the under@@ lining din@@ os@@ aur@@ s that has ever been found , and one of the best din@@ os@@ aur@@ s specimens in the world . &quot;
&quot; fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ aur@@ s , which lived in the middle of the chal@@ k period between 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that describe it as &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; aston@@ ished &quot;
&quot; according to reports at National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he died on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the place , and decided to see more precise . &quot;
the Fossi@@ l discovered by him was sent to the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pale@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; you spent the next six years to un@@ cover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) to un@@ cover serious ground@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; after all of this hard work , the finished product is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you are just blin@@ king with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum , where the creature is visible . &quot;
&quot; in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , Mon@@ a Lisa is the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; researchers found that this plant @-@ e@@ aters , although he is covered with an arm@@ aments , and resembles a changing tanks , probably threatened by meat eating din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the strongly ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ fl@@ age to hide itself from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technology used as a bac@@ kl@@ ess , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to mix better into his surroundings and so@@ ften its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by bigger din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ r family has made head@@ lines in May and is now visible in the Royal T@@ yr@@ rell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers now studied the wild animal and it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta market mark@@ ers after the Muse@@ um@@ ste@@ ker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours . &quot;
&quot; the astonishing preservation of the copies , made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the form of shed and arm@@ our on his body . &quot;
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ aded , a common defence method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the tip of the creature was dark@@ er than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ aded practice is custom@@ ary , the results are surprising since the size of bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta is by far the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by sufficient pressure due to meat eating , din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted that the Evolution fav@@ ours the decay of the confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ sh@@ aded areas - think of deer , z@@ ebras or gir@@ ders - are much smaller and hur@@ t@@ ful than prey , which sign@@ alizes that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ r was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ ory behavior on a massive , strong ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s show how dangerous the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s predat@@ ors have been the chal@@ k @-@ time , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r is rot@@ or .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life , including his consistent bo@@ min@@ tes , to find out what it has eaten as its last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s , when he died , went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea . &quot;
&quot; at this time Alberta was as warm as South flu@@ oride today , and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ aur@@ s is really remarkable because it is completely covered with cont@@ ested skin , but also in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast &quot; &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k period .
&quot; you do not need much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you &apos;re just a little using your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the chal@@ k time was a time , when huge Ther@@ opo@@ den , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ os@@ aur@@ s stood on two legs , the earth crossed . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the ty@@ ran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ os@@ aur@@ s was hun@@ ted by some of his fur@@ tive ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ n@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 1@@ 1.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose recent findings appear in the journal Cur@@ rent Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta was vers@@ ed after the death in the sea and converted into mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Fun@@ k when he died on March 21 , 2011 at Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alberta , Canada , gru@@ b . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the cro@@ wned din@@ os@@ aur@@ s of the world , including skin and arm@@ aments , and is complete from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have wei@@ ghed up to 3.000 pounds ( 1.@@ 300 kg ) .
&quot; it contained two 20 @-@ inch long tips , which ra@@ ked by his shoulders . &quot;
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ aters was shaken by Western Canada , until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea . &quot;
but the underwater bur@@ ial of the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s keep his armor in exquisite detail .
&quot; the hidden remn@@ ants of this particular specimen are so well preserved , that the skin remains still b@@ umpy tank plates along the din@@ os@@ aur@@ s . &quot;
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko has written for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lot@@ to . &quot;
&quot; the more I see it , the more confusing it gets . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied side of the skin still cover the b@@ umpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his re@@ chter leave is on his side , his five fingers are stra@@ ined up . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass @-@ kar@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
intense accident on Thursday evening at the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , mile long St@@ aus - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
on the highway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) have been injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age about 20 people .
&quot; according to the police , the police were between 17@@ .00 o &apos;clock between the connector of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( County of Ai@@ ch@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storms almost 30 vehicles , including also trucks , inter@@ connected . &quot;
&quot; above all , the exact number of these statements were initially no information . &quot;
&quot; it is light to moderate @-@ severe injury , said a poli@@ ze@@ al pre@@ cher . &quot;
a big bu@@ ot on b@@ ail@@ out vehicles was at the accident place .
the A@@ 8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .
in the direction of the direction of the direction of Munich a ten kilometers long ar@@ mo@@ st@@ au formed .
&quot; as an A@@ Z @-@ re@@ porters reported , it also came on the way to massive disability - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire@@ fighters noted the hall@@ marks of the vehicle &apos;s vehicle , who now have to reck@@ on with delicate pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , a second accident at the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger .
a Res@@ cue @-@ helicopter was on the road to the accident .
Deutsche Bahn : group testing &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing &apos;s , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot;
or it is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : pu@@ ff@@ f .
comes the Schaff@@ ner and awak@@ ens an impro@@ per or put the g@@ ast in the middle of the work@@ flow .
travel control .
but the times of inter@@ rup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn currently tests the managed card control .
&quot; they simply confirmed by phone , that one should be taken in place and de@@ grades the ticket . &quot;
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer is made , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available at the beginning of the year on many other remote routes in Germany , &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; is called the railway the ticket validation without any Schaff@@ ner .
&quot; in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements need to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have bought it via the app of rail , the DB navig@@ ator , which anyway is the most convenient way of ticket booking . &quot;
and last you need a seat reservation .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works thus : you get in the train , calling his ticket at &quot; My tickets . &quot; &quot;
at the test customer then a button for electronic de@@ valuation .
the Zug@@ companion get on their mobile devices a message that driver X is located on the train and taken the booked seat Y Y .
&quot; if the track manager at the card control is placed in place Y , he knows that there is a passenger with already un@@ paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who are relaxed without ticket control should be travelling through our migr@@ ated personnel , check in the DB Navigator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train for personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , marketing executive board of DB remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual needs . &quot;
&quot; who often drives train , knows that besides delays and missed the road controls are among the biggest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for often , in any case , one of the fellow travelers do not have all the documents that you need to de@@ valuation online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the ID card or else a document you have to pre@@ dict .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between Zug@@ companion and g@@ ast , which leads to bad mood in part or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and take the Schaff@@ ner at the end of the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of testing customers can use the new service .
and that also applies to the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
further migr@@ numbers on the same route are still un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
on 9 August 2014 Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rell was shaken as far as to their core .
&quot; just one day after she arrived in New York City , who sat in St. Louis in the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment that they rented and sc@@ rolling through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled across a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year child , and it is still on the street , &quot; says it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Ph@@ aro@@ ah was constantly saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the r@@ apper from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black @-@ year @-@ old that was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , M@@ on . , killed live to twe@@ et . &quot;
&quot; he po@@ sted a picture of a sli@@ ce li@@ f@@ eless body , which was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours . &quot;
&quot; this is wild , &quot; thought Fer@@ rell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she put her cell phone to return later in the evening to go to T@@ we@@ et about people on the Can@@ field Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people who cried out , and from a man who claimed to be Bro@@ wns &apos; father , who contributed a sign with the wording : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live Fe@@ ed in which a poli@@ cem@@ an was in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ er dog .
&quot; in another video , she said that another poli@@ cem@@ an his ri@@ f@@ le and cried : &quot; I will kill you ... animals all kill you . &quot;
&quot; that is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel reminded itself about her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call it typical .
at this moment I felt Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ fro@@ st .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a flight back and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she fet@@ ched her 6 @-@ year old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the theme of a new documentary film , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; , &quot; in the movie theaters on 11 . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and Protest@@ es , of love and loss , strength and resistance , which is of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel with her daughter , which carried a flower gar@@ ment and a suitable crown , headed by F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two had a conversation that they had lots of times before this morning &quot; &quot; about the black experience and the black condition . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember , how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; remember what she said . &quot;
&quot; now we go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police have killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that was not right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her away , &quot; said Fer@@ rell . &quot;
that which has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it is necessary to know and see it and be re@@ ared in it .
&quot; it has to be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to liber@@ ate ourselves . &quot;
&quot; but if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally had not experienced racism , it is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
&quot; I have the feeling , I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away . &quot;
&quot; the first station when she arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was to a camp@@ ground when the activists were waiting for the possible non @-@ indictment by Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Fer@@ rell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner .
they prepared bags in front of and helped to pass them on demonstr@@ ators .
slowly began a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rell &apos;s shape .
&quot; my activ@@ ism has changed completely after August 9th , she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rell met at an evening demonstration Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said , she and her comrades Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ rar just wanted to document &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to mind , &quot; &quot; do you document it , or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nourished by numerous cases of people , often by white - in a community , who benefited from their pain and resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an stated recently in an interview : &quot; &quot; we heard that people who were born in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on and raised up their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already worked together with the then co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the field , which is known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ dd @-@ in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought the project closer together with six other indigenous people followed by the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after bro@@ wns . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we speak , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; this was the main thing for me , as these people will be presented , because I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was to concentrate on Ferr@@ ells &apos; experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader , but about a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - she proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is life , as she loves and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel and lau@@ ghed , when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understood that at this work and in the de@@ human@@ ization of black people must give a certain vulner@@ ability .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is history repeatedly reiter@@ ate the role of black cur@@ ls women in the broader black @-@ Li@@ ves movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , which after the kill@@ ings of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ from Martin in 2012 have shaped the movie &quot; Black@@ li@@ ves@@ Mat@@ ter &quot; in social media , identify as sw@@ am . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; said Fer@@ rell , &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must carry the main last of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice , that &quot; the movement really maintained between black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it exists that &quot; this is not a affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; which has been chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; it was the person that stir@@ red up this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the front line , because in a life on these crosses when a black , sul@@ try woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; now the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;

from &quot; dream &quot; to &quot; size w@@ ahn &quot; : TV readers discuss about bit @-@ gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , although it is not yet built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the South @-@ edge of the pedestrian area has been divi@@ des the population in pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .
cold the issue hardly leaves one .
even on our Facebook page &quot; Pop@@ ulation and Bit@@ burg &quot; the topic is discussed .
&quot; saying one to the bit gallery , &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( An@@ ja Becker ) or &quot; &quot; that would be real &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sts ) , comes from the other side : &quot; &quot; needs no human &quot; &quot; ( Sig@@ gi Bet@@ ter ) or very simple : &quot; &quot; size w@@ ahn ! &quot; &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents are building that a gallery draws more customers into the city , from which the rest of the businesses will benefit , fear that then the pedestrian streets are destroyed . &quot;
&quot; added to the property : the gallery is planned exactly on the property , on which the farm@@ land hall is in the 13 direct market @-@ market products . &quot;
with the beginning of construction work will eventually be .
&quot; the Gallery makers want to integrate a mark@@ eth@@ all in the new building - in addition to the Bed@@ a Square , with possibility of sitting outside sitting . &quot;
Simone Rooms : &quot; we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the women always enjoy very happy . &quot;
also the but@@ cher have discovered for us too .
&quot; we would like to see that , during and above all , after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer . &quot;
in other cities there is the same .
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ d D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; &quot; whether a direct market hall is moved to the gallery , comes at the height of the rent . &quot;
&quot; this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what shopping palace in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find it unnecessary . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
one sees how many shop stores will be empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not yet another weekly market place , it is all the more important that at least keeping us the market hall . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered here are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the manufacturer and is purely inexpensive . &quot;
&quot; you can see shop stores in a shopping centre only by larger companies , as the dor@@ sal r@@ ents are often not viable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special places there is almost no more and that which is still left , will probably also disappear . &quot;
Wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping center with a mark@@ eth@@ all fits me not together .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
especially : where is the agrit@@ ourism during the construction period ?
&quot; the old E@@ DE@@ KA would be the solution - even in the long run , if the bit gallery will eventually come . &quot;
or does it create the gh@@ ost bit @-@ gallery before to distribute all shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; this will just not work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , does not need any one . &quot;
&quot; in my view , it would have been better to encourage a real farm market instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a peasant hall , it is thanks to the ins@@ ane many - as I find - meaning@@ less construction projects in Bit@@ burg no longer place . &quot;
&quot; when the peasant hall is broken , again a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the space of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ con@@ sp@@ ic@@ uous - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen tu@@ bing and hair sections that you were sent to Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth where the former secret service analy@@ zer sent a 35 @-@ year @-@ old sentence after she publicly declared diplomatic reports on the website of Wiki@@ Le@@ aks .
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Be@@ ef St@@ blan@@ ce ( An appropriate similarity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline unified its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and groundbreaking discs , whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has been extracted by the algorithms analysis of DNA , which could be extracted from Mann@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , as anyone with these genom@@ ic data could look , a sharp , if something intellectual comment can not only be interpreted by the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the in@@ dur@@ ations determin@@ ants of these interpre@@ tations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since their pu@@ ber@@ ty , was condemned 2013 because of 20 charges , including six breaches of the sp@@ on@@ age@@ on , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; in jail , her image was sup@@ pressed , so much that there was only one single photo - a gran@@ ular , black @-@ white Sel@@ fie , in which Mann@@ ing is visi@@ bly sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and has a plat@@ o@@ cr@@ ates associated with which it was associated . &quot;
in 2015 De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; .
in that the artist portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic ar@@ te@@ facts like cigarette smoke and che@@ wing g@@ um by extrac@@ ting the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people might look .
this was the time when it received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they carried an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; stated De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press conference of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not visit this time , and she could not be photographed , so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use were replaced with un@@ equal bril@@ liance , in the course of two years sharing several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created one of Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o illustrated Com@@ ic &quot; Sup@@ pressed Images , &quot; who would fores@@ ee a future in which the President Chel@@ m &apos;s judgement would convert and she would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released , Mann@@ ing release would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome way of happy coming . &quot;
&quot; there is also something for opening the exhibition at the opening of the exhibition , and St@@ ark@@ es , da Donald Tr@@ ump leads a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government warehouse and against trans@@ gender forces , to find new , twe@@ e@@ ful paths that he actually should fix , continue to infl@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things are happening for a given reason . &quot;
&quot; in one on the wall of the gallery written down the artistic statement , Mann@@ ing with its superior description below ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is provided with a heart ) an end to the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation may have been gender , race , sexuality and culture . &quot;
&quot; the opposite wall is its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thou@@ sand@@ al spr@@ ite from Cs and Gs and As , in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped , with the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ de , according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist ) , how amazing similar , at least in biological respects , we all are . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in an independent room , is a page from the aforementioned Com@@ ic @-@ No@@ vel@@ le . &quot;
she shows man@@ ing as she appears with a hands @-@ hand fl@@ on in the hands of the discipl@@ in@@ ark@@ as@@ ure of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; if they put your speech , then they have won , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter that she wrote me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeted out of Philadelphia . &quot;
&quot; I still get ge@@ ese , if I speak about it . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was fores@@ een in the com@@ ic book - but if they do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own genom@@ ic simulation , which merged like hor@@ des of prot@@ agon@@ izing . &quot;
&quot; this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , where their genetic H@@ ap@@ log@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y Hag@@ borg said of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement , which formed up with Chelsea , as the movement that tasted behind their liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of North@@ western and a cler@@ k of the University of Oxford because of the kill@@ ings
&quot; a national hunting hunt is underway for a professor at North@@ western University and one of Oxford University of Oxford , which was sought as susp@@ ects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was made with deadly injury . &quot;
on Monday have been issued for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) Ar@@ rest War@@ rant because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau , 26 , after several stit@@ ches died . &quot;
&quot; one of the police authority of Chicago , a collective war@@ time system states that the body was discovered on 27 July . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ leau was still explained on the site of the action for dead , and det@@ ectives the stit@@ ches as a murder , while the police are actively searching for the two susp@@ ects , they said officials . &quot;
La@@ them@@ self has been extraordinary professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at North@@ western University since 2007 .
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ i , the Vice President for Universitäts@@ Relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them@@ self now being assessed in assessed and excluded from entering the campus of North@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal affair that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and the North@@ western University is co @-@ operation in this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ an . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .
&quot; a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College , in an e @-@ mail statement , said that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK , and ready to aid the US investig@@ ators in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ my colleagues were shocked and wanting to stand .
&quot; Chief Communications Officer of the police authority of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he also urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to loc@@ alize them , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building administration of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip , said that in apartment 10@@ 08 something happened . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 .
it was confirmed by safety cameras that La@@ them@@ self and War@@ ren in the building were .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published a statement on the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim , and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the W@@ ada map in the near future &quot; &quot; - the Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian vice @-@ president Vit@@ aly Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( W@@ ada ) will be implemented for the recovery of the Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage meeting the criteria of the roadmap , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in collaboration with UK@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the W@@ ada roadmap was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; Mut@@ ko announced on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM comment@@ ated on the second part of the roadmap of W@@ ada for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for re@@ installation of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and recently published on the website of the organization . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause a concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and W@@ ada in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria mentioned in the above criteria is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities approved the reported results of the alleged investigation by the Canadian attorney Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , alleged to publicly accept dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , since our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos words voted with those of Vit@@ aly Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; talking to Russian sales point R@@ Sport at the beginning of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has before , accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; he added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded in November 2015 in the course of the dop@@ ing Sk@@ and@@ as by the W@@ ada of the execution of dop@@ ing trials in Russia .
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ dop@@ ing ( UK@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the main character of the organization in Moscow in July , W@@ ada @-@ General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli , that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs more
this shared the company groups .
&quot; it deals with a mere review , it could not be assumed further from any health draw@@ backs , it is called in the communication . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs for Al@@ di should be delivered , which have been tested adver@@ sely on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ lam@@ ination . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency for its customers .
&quot; the start @-@ ups which will help your business , do not become the next U@@ ber &quot;
Amy Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure the luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the pol@@ ls didn &apos;t work out .
&quot; answers were often v@@ ague , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; and even if you spoke anonym@@ ity , some workers do not lament after the trial . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectivity , &quot; &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce H@@ air Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
it has called people from outside to help .
a new race of the Human Resources Start @-@ ups is at wa@@ xing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee commitment , it allows companies to address surveys , specific groups and demographic groups , and in some cases wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers permit to deal with the C @-@ Suite managers and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools like Stra@@ va and Fit@@ Bit for tracking their health , but where is the Fit@@ Bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive from Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ ret@@ t said , that she has a better insight into what your employees think and feel during the three years with G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat @-@ card of the company that shows on a glance which units have most complaints and which executives will have low cons@@ ents results - so that you can drill . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must be seen , so that you are not the next U@@ ber , which has since been published in Sk@@ and@@ als , who describes a former employee a blog post , who was talked to those who have talked . &quot;
for start @-@ ups such as G@@ lin@@ t , this desire for an overview is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business possibility . &quot;
&quot; the Global Governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the bud@@ get@@ ary technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Conver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent bad behavior and recognize , saw a rising interest and activity early this year in the midst of U@@ ber F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; convertible has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Conver@@ cent companies can send customized &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , confidential answers in real time and watch the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
&quot; it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line , with which the employee can report bad behaviour . &quot;
&quot; and if the main business guide is involved , complaints can go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the Reg@@ ul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Quin@@ lan , founder and Managing Director of Conver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or imp@@ eth@@ ically beha@@ ves , it can experience precious consequences by consumer boy@@ cott , workers and pillows , said Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , calcul@@ cent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; earlier , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to submit a phone number or e @-@ mail for the company central to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a intimi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ruby Tu@@ es@@ days General Coun@@ sel , who said , there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now that the company uses Conver@@ cent , can be problems that have been hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or un@@ sp@@ read@@ ability to be identified quicker and addressed . &quot;
&quot; I can get closer to this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view of experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment , legal disputes . &quot;
&quot; company began to take ethics , values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accoun@@ tant @-@ company Arthur Ander@@ sen was collap@@ sed because of ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Quin@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; but it took until the &quot; social media &quot; came to their right , &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry . &quot;
&quot; prior to using technology for monitoring ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; both G@@ lin@@ t and Conver@@ cent offer your software as a service , and load the companies with recur@@ rent fees for the use of their products . &quot;
&quot; it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Invest@@ ors , who have both start @-@ ups . &quot;
&quot; the Conver@@ cent received $ 10 million when financing in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Ventures and T@@ ola Capital , which has raised the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el secured $ 10 million in November by Bes@@ se@@ mer Venture Partners , and launched its entire financing to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; this investment is hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more than before . &quot;
competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high sal@@ aries and interesting projects only bets .
staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to feel at a company that pays their voices and that the work you do is worth it , then Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience , in Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Conver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors achieve ren@@ ces when their portfolio companies are well run . companies run well when employees are engaged and engaged .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise , commitment and commitment of employees to increase , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data are useless if the administrator of an enterprise does not take action .
&quot; in fact , if a company asked employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , this can grow dis@@ appointments and dem@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must have prepared to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Russell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , the company has already left to rely on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you do not follow your staff will ask , &quot; &quot; Hab@@ t you really hear me ? &quot;
take care of that ?
and whom should not worry about why should I ?
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , which now leads monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustrated workers , they were able to re@@ organise the decision @-@ making and the quality of communication , able to re@@ organize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ruby Tuesday , the company always gets new insights on the employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this leads to a better understanding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to create a culture of transparency , you will lose man , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customer . &quot;
and if you lose customers then you will lose company .
the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the rup@@ ture
it is on 23 o &apos;clock to see a lot of U@@ CL@@ A Foot@@ ball@@ ers on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have put off their tri@@ p@@ cs and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
for a good part of the team they represent a lunch break .
players who are inscri@@ bed on the summer courses will return after the three @-@ hour exercise to their audi@@ ts before they return the next morning at 6 : 30 to the Aqu@@ man Football Center .
&quot; this is for the guys the next three days a real tre@@ ad@@ mill , &quot; &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday to Tuesday was opened . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A elimin@@ ates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and she has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three trainings of the U@@ CL@@ A at 19 : 15 begin to meet the already packed schedules of players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise from the two days is more than a day , where Bru@@ ges moved to the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school , during the summer school , during the first time during the summer school , during the summer school , performed practical exercises . &quot;
they should stop in the course of August 18 exercises . 20 before the formal play preparations for their pr@@ el@@ ude to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he support the N@@ CA@@ A control , even if they add a further point to the busy routes of players . &quot;
&quot; we put these enormous stress three or four days on them , and it is very challenging , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; and they simply put it down , they plac@@ ken up , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ CL@@ A will end their practices as soon as the camp is finished , what has been thrown by the clear sight of its fields from an adjacent parking and the adjoining Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that has already been thrown with pedest@@ rians , which will be a protective network behind a door@@ way , not an easy task . &quot;
&quot; brood @-@ ins are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a adm@@ its that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people rent a room there and then set up a exercise there . &quot;
if you have the vide@@ ot@@ or of an exercise it is quite a good deal .
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
that is why I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensify facts in the fight against counterf@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with counterf@@ eit Doc@@ uments to the fac@@ t@@ amp@@ er of third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in an opinion on his website , that it is beginning to begin by the use of updated machine methods to identify possible counterf@@ eit applications and to review them in fact @-@ audi@@ ted which may display results of the fact @-@ examination from the original article . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main points for so @-@ called F@@ ake @-@ News . many of them believe that they have influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , whereby the French voters were punished for the presidential election in May with false hist@@ ories , and Germany will support a plan to be punished for social media networks , when it succe@@ eds them , h@@ asser@@ ted posters as before the elections there in September soon . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook told a separate declaration in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany will start a test of new facts . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories of fact @-@ tested , third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; &quot; Sarah S@@ u , Product commander for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
she added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the &quot; related articles &quot; and work on other changes to his news fe@@ ed to decrease false news .
creating a Com@@ ic novel : a castle in the history of England

&quot; but Scot@@ ney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history at the Be@@ wl River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ ired Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &apos; sp@@ ans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney - Isaac Len@@ kie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isabel Green@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he un@@ expect@@ edly found emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to the thum@@ b pressure on the side of a letter , who was written by a double @-@ car in the 1700 @-@ er years , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thum@@ b @-@ pressure ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell to smoke , because at that time one lit a fire because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect , as if he himself . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who be@@ aten up with old papers is that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England , and almost four months lived in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : ) it all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rhodes spent his days exploring the Vict@@ orian &quot; new &quot; castle , exploring the archives and study the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mon@@ mented hydraulic heads at the walls and the bottles spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle and spoke to Land@@ scap@@ es , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and started writing . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 as the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; as Rhodes a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as &quot; hundreds of years , in which Ar@@ isto@@ cr@@ ates said , &quot; Oh , wir@@ es it on the attic . &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of English rebellion , cards which represent what possessed , &quot; one could mean that land conflict would be boring , &quot; says Rhodes , &quot; but there was a pe@@ ar in order to have fought the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go his way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English history , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle , in order to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a mo@@ ver , which appeared in 13@@ 80 in the castle , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ fe , of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , says Rhodes . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought , an insurrection was a good start . &quot;
maybe the two are connected to each other ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patented , who hid the family Dar@@ rell seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , represented in that of the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ rell from the 18th century , when he filled a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later , when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
the Dar@@ r@@ ells are the Rhodes &apos; favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; the masters seemed to be forth@@ right to always make debt and spend money for things they could not afford .
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ al men extingu@@ ishes their debt crises by rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good @-@ looking boys , with a talent to advertise Er@@ in . &quot;
after the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for another unique write @-@ experiences
&quot; he has brought a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a com@@ ic novel about E@@ sm@@ iles , the terrain of a san@@ at@@ orio from the early 20th century , which since then has been re@@ claimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like this : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to cope with the dam@@ ned life . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ en@@ kap@@ elle wrapped in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the obs@@ cur@@ v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ en@@ cap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the town of Bad Honnef began on Friday their campaign to introduce a new roof mark ( Rundschau of Thursday ) . &quot;
until Thursday Mayor Otto N@@ EU@@ HO@@ FF and his marketing team want to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and the slogan secret .
in the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th .
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? , &quot; ask the makers of action since yesterday on the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dor@@ fer chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) not really , write them on their un@@ locked website . &quot;
but we use this measure to gain your attention .
and to make clear that some is better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we are the firm conviction that we as a Bad Honne@@ fer citizens know about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is considered to form@@ ulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique feature . &quot;
finally they stand in competition with other municipalities .
a middle five @-@ digit amount will be the city of Bad Honnef gives rise to the new roof brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan fear of the army
every year in early August consul@@ ts in Ankara of the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ as ) about pen@@ sion@@ ers and carriage in the officer &apos; officer &apos; .
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
&quot; but nothing is a routine in the Turkish armed forces , a year after the coup . &quot;
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as formerly , but in the office seat of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presidency of the state , the five vice @-@ chief executive committee as well as the Ministers of Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in Y@@ as were in the over@@ head . &quot;
the government draws the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; President Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander of the army , the air forces and the nav@@ y have been dis@@ continued . &quot;
&quot; since the failed Cou@@ p , President Erdo@@ gan 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who sees the Erdo@@ gan as a wire pro@@ pul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; up to 4@@ 86 people , who were directly involved in the coup , will be in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow of &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift , &quot; &quot; as he give him the opportunity to clean@@ se the armed forces &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan the army really handle ?
&quot; in the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ eas@@ iness in the Military @-@ Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the General Staff , there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , among other things , in the lifting of the head of the head @-@ bot@@ s for soldiers , the newspaper wrote . &quot;
the generosity process at the army and the security forces will be on any rate .
&quot; in the middle of July Erdo@@ gan ordered by decree , another 7@@ 3@@ 95 coup , including 2@@ 303 poli@@ c@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
yet it seemed that Erdo@@ gan the army t@@ amed .
the gener@@ als are formerly the actual masters of the country .
three times put@@ ted them under appeal on their role as guardian of the worldly state of affairs .
&quot; after his election on 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling for reform of the European Union . &quot;
former officials say Erdo@@ gan &apos;s driving force targeted by Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe &quot; &quot; a particularly so @-@ called officer who searched for the coup from fear of persecution in asylum , the Turkish army will be in a few years &quot; full of extremis@@ ts and sal@@ af@@ ists . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for this , such a development could not be cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there is a doubt in the alliance after the cleansing of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational abilities are &quot; weak@@ ened , &quot; Nato . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining visa for a perpet@@ ual work permit and restrictions for families @-@ oriented visa . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Republi@@ can and supported by the President .
&quot; the bill , should be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty reducing wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ payers and will do so by changing the way that the US will change the way from other countries of Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chains of migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will come to the candidates who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tr@@ ump , cited by the American media . &quot;
Ministry wants to renov@@ ate the track for the race
over the past few months the future of the racing car had been denied - now it is supposed to go very quickly .
even before the end of the year is expected to be built at the m@@ aro@@ on track on which the run@@ way drives .
&quot; in order to secure the future of the racing car in the long term , according to the traffic Ministry , the traffic will still begin on the track in this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to order and san@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country knows the country especially important for tourism , &quot; said Mr. Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
&quot; the costs for the maintenance of the track , he secured to approximately 2.5 million euros . &quot;
&quot; from this sum , the land take over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on whose basis the shuttle is also to be ordered in the future from the country , I am currently final , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the ministry and the southern railway as an operator were already agreed on the technical details .
&quot; this means the roadmap that the vehicles used and the quality standards have been negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
so the race acceler@@ ator will be ordered in December 2017 .
the race ri@@ g shuttle is mainly popular among tourists popular rail link between the stations of Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the course of a pilot plant in the course of a pilot plant , the distance was used by sufficient many people to order it again in the future . &quot;
the track is also highly di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated in parts .
the rise of sex robot@@ ic is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can not be even crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex @-@ robots are currently a great thing .
recently the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robotics ( Foundation for responsible Robotics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robot@@ ics in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , em@@ eri@@ ed Professor for Robotics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ ield and co @-@ founder of FR@@ R , we have to start to take her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye colour of the robot , its shape of ni@@ pp@@ le and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people get fun with them , but the companies supplying a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; &quot; Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey said in the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern s@@ exp@@ ia have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also adapt its robot according to their beliefs &quot; and select everything from the eye colour of the robot on the shape of ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or the color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it is still more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities , &quot; which would look a step@@ ford @-@ woman progressive . &quot;
modern S@@ exp@@ and@@ ans have developed to robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; for example , the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they think are appealing like for example . &quot;
and then there is the Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy Gold Sex @-@ robot with pre @-@ programmed personalities as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of obli@@ vi@@ ality and &quot; Wild W@@ endy &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the website of True . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
during the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robot@@ ics - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ ordinate female characteristics , the all@@ u@@ sions on rape , if one walks a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( being here : resist@@ able ) Far@@ rah is going to be one most . &quot;
on his website the sp@@ y ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why do men then have no Ro@@ x@@ x@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tic or just another sex toys . &quot;
their origins and their increasing refinement point on something dark and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with sub@@ jug@@ ation as an optional en@@ core .
&quot; most men will of course not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R notice their growing popularity , they still remain provisional on the edge of the consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what per@@ oo@@ zes out of the edge @-@ zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live , very instruc@@ tive . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until giving them the free market there is permission .
&quot; however , there is a certain over@@ l@@ apping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the white house that has bo@@ iled to have women sexually attacked . &quot;
&quot; the most aw@@ ful aspect of the TV series &quot; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the Mag@@ d &apos;@@ ) are not the graphical pictures , the winding bodies and the out@@ stretched eyes but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( if also with Por@@ no@@ star Pro@@ por@@ tions ) .
they want their inheritance to feel human that they are im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots represent no real women . &quot;
you can not separate yourself from your companion or just leave .
&quot; they have no mediation or a background history , nothing that hin@@ ders on independence or anything that might interfere with the fantasy of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , you are fake slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrases of 2017 : ma@@ ids
very big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney to the end of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a ties of the Tr@@ ump @-@ era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , even families in the small format . &quot;
around Christmas and harvest thought there were newspapers in the United States with advice on how to deal with the horror of tr@@ ump @-@ elected relatives .
we are all pur@@ pos@@ ing to put all of us to put our filter bub@@ bles .
&quot; to notice less , the power is tr@@ umps , families . &quot;
&quot; I chose this because my c@@ ousine , a centre @-@ orient@@ ated seal , who lives in Chicago and has long visited the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , who visited me in New York for a long time . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with which they had fought for decades due to politics , suddenly and completely unique on the same side . &quot;
&quot; to the dining table that is certainly a good thing , but it falls me in another context that this will bring significant risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the postpon@@ able effect of his presidency has the power to push us all right to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alisation &quot; &quot; and tr@@ ump , we refer to the gr@@ asp@@ ed possibility that his kittens will no longer be distr@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; however , there is still a recur@@ rent long @-@ term scenario in which Tr@@ ump Re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing @-@ wing is norm@@ alized , &quot; which suddenly appeared compared to its standards as a notion of denial . &quot;
&quot; nowadays I find myself from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s com@@ ic version of the ma@@ d@@ ach - the dog on the Auto@@ d@@ ach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement saw ) - both compared to Tr@@ ump in fact appear to be a very mild crime . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of Re@@ public@@ ans must be healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousine was in the city , we brought our children to the Car@@ us@@ sell in Central Park , the largest of the Kar@@ uss@@ ells of New York parking department , and the best three dollars that you can spend in town if you do not need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all of the clo@@ wns are cris@@ y and the animals are revol@@ ve to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ changing music also conve@@ ys this in a peculiar fashion . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Sky@@ lines are becoming familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Y@@ e Ol@@ de Swiss Cottage is not one - but a big roundabout in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , Central Park Kar@@ us@@ sell is still a strange magic experience since here are two year @-@ old , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ s and have had a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have been able to evaluate the car@@ ou@@ sel , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one has asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; &quot; experience &quot; &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to settle the rating with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to a slo@@ wing of what actually should be a neutral exchange , but also exer@@ ts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was apologi@@ zing , while I tired the experience made her credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar P@@ ist@@ ori@@ us with breast ache from prison to hospital
P@@ ist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital at the second time .
&quot; last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand , he suffered prison authorities according to a case in his cell . &quot;
P@@ ist@@ ori@@ us was condemned because of murder by a call for pro@@ secut@@ ors against a first crus@@ ade .
&quot; he k@@ ills Ste@@ en@@ kam@@ p in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day 2013 , by placing them several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ t@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ist@@ ori@@ us maintained that he held his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , who hid himself in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ secut@@ ors announced their intention , this time to appeal against the six @-@ year prison sentence of P@@ ist@@ ori@@ us , by which they say they are too indul@@ gent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Tribunal , said that they will raise an objection to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection may be heard this year . &quot;
P@@ ist@@ ori@@ us is risk that his sentence increased to 15 years if the pro@@ secut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as a farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters of the guns and villages were released into the holidays and in the continuing schools . &quot;
three of the dec@@ eived students in the future go to the g@@ ymnasium , four to the Real@@ schule . &quot;
school leader Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the house of Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen on Saturday evening .

&quot; Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and left it by his chicken . &quot;
instead of a chicken idea came a little eagle .
&quot; but the hope to make out of him a chicken , then the eagle struck up his wings on a high mountain , and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the chor@@ us of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a hen . &quot;
&quot; the Hen@@ ning danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , the cylin@@ ders contributed to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for the integration , said Schul@@ te Angel@@ ika Sit@@ te . &quot;
&quot; young may be different from the other young animals ( chi@@ cks ) , but also belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his purpose is to be free .
she wished for every four @-@ quarters that he feels in his new school .
&quot; followed this word to the colleagues , the former school manager Michael Müller , who again jumps at the teaching of teaching , and the parents of parents . &quot;
the kitchen @-@ time was over now the class teacher Sophia Schu@@ macher .
&quot; they leave their students after two years of lessons only very helpful , because it had been a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they have been able to rely on the four @-@ quarters . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
the children was great pleasure with the children .

software update for diesel cars : what people are to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
need diesel drivers take part in the action ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
the emission behaviour of emissions from emissions to Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 are expected to improve .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ diesel or worse are exemp@@ t from it .
An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in of the ACE Auto Club Europe are estim@@ ations :
is the new action compulsory ?
&quot; no , the tra@@ ded software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously only apply to the cars , the Schum@@ ann software , &quot; says An@@ ja S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
its retro@@ fit has arranged the power station ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed of updates ?
&quot; the makers have announced a rapid implementation in the coming months , but not an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has informed us to write every person concerned .
&quot; if any inspection should be due , it will be settled within the framework . &quot;
how long are the conversion possible to go up in total ?
&quot; difficult to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
this depends on the commitment of the manufacturers as well as from political pressure .
&quot; for we have seen , voluntary act the autom@@ akers on the subject of the environment so far not . &quot;
how long will the update take ?
the upgrade itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .
time consuming it could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , which do not drive car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE is waiting for you to wait .
&quot; probably , foreign manufacturers would withdraw , so S@@ met@@ an@@ in . &quot;
is now a massive price fall of Euro @-@ 4 @-@ cars ?
the ACE feared that .
&quot; but even in the regions , where driving b@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no value loss for older diesel . &quot;
the ACE is to wait with a sale yet .

&quot; at the same time , it won@@ dro@@ us that so far no application has been added to the requirement profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next time .
so - under consideration of the regular notice of notice - still enough time to be re @-@ review .
&quot; since Has@@ l@@ ach is in charge of the administrative community as a sub@@ committee authority , the applicant must pre@@ dict their respective degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city defin@@ ately .
&quot; if they can no longer be able to do this , the citizens would have to go to the advisory service up to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the city &apos;s proximity to the city and himself is important , says W@@ acker , who is of a good working atmosphere , as well as good mood between authority and citizens . &quot;
in more than 30 years in office some major projects have gained attention on the W@@ acker with pride .
&quot; we make the city liv@@ able , he is confident about the office and its employees . &quot;
but also in the future the varied projects on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the low @-@ park parking lot about are stir@@ red .
&quot; the Kin@@ zi@@ g@@ bridge between B@@ oll@@ en@@ bach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , even the stage is still subject matter . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will hit by some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; &quot; appreci@@ ates W@@ acker . &quot;
&quot; all in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; design for a Stadt@@ bau@@ master of great room , there is no room for man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ l@@ ach@@ s own building and gar@@ den@@ ers , there can be quite flexible in many ways . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; &quot; W@@ acker , and the design of the green systems is often praised by citizens and visitors often . &quot;
&quot; since the old town is as an ensemble of monument protection , it is important to have &quot; an eye for it , which fits &quot; &quot; when new@@ buildings are approved , empha@@ sizes the cre@@ tory city master . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the city @-@ master bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a building , &quot; in the end everything works on my table . &quot;
&quot; with care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ maier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( low construction ) has been for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , wishes W@@ acker : &quot; we are looking for someone who really identified and stay with the place . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good company atmosphere , but also for the further development of the city . &quot;
&quot; who wants to take Roland W@@ acker , according to information from Has@@ l@@ ach , a completed study as a diploma engineer or Bachelor with specialized architecture can and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law . &quot;
&quot; under the municipal office , high@@ - and civil engineering , construction planning , full @-@ level affairs , management of urban assets , urban buildings with construction and city houses , as well as sub@@ ordin@@ ances , including memorial protection . &quot;
bike on lines thrown : ground @-@ route locked
&quot; according to the police , the far @-@ known perpetr@@ ator had thrown the blue bike away from the railroad crossing in the area of the Le@@ ob@@ ener Street ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the her@@ ap@@ prehen@@ sive freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male ten@@ ders and are looking for hours after them .
near the scene of witnesses a ros@@ lav Rol@@ ler@@ - and a bike driver has been observed .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ itz@@ ring coup , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch to the APA . &quot;
the perpetrators or the perpetrators brought themselves into great danger and is also endangered by the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the Lo@@ k and the plant as well as the delays and the cost of rail traffic , even P@@ ön@@ alen of the train could be brought to the perpetrators . &quot;
&quot; altogether , to go from a &quot; &quot; considerable &quot; &quot; sum , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damages were fixed on Friday afternoon , the rail traffic on the ground track could be guided without disability . &quot;
&quot; almost ten people of course , there were a Friday afternoon , two of them looked at the remote traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains does not fall out , but they were delayed . &quot;
according to Ö@@ BB @-@ spokes@@ man Christoph Pos@@ ch had to be exchanged about 200 meters high @-@ lines .
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , milk products and chocolate may help to rel@@ ieve IB@@ D ( inflammation or inflammation ) . &quot;
red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the contrary : a diet that is rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States of 300@@ ,000 , causes stomach ul@@ ts and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually coming to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washingtoner Artenschutz@@ discovered that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells to develop a tolerant intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; the introductory researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , declared that immun@@ o cells pat@@ rol in the gut to make sure that damaging micro@@ bes that hide in food not into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are capable of det@@ ecting inflammation , are balanced by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue . &quot;
&quot; when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in a infl@@ amed cause . &quot;
&quot; in experiments , it has been determined that a kind of tolerance is promoting immune cell on mice , that carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their intest@@ ines . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins to em@@ ulate the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and an on tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory bo@@ wel mi@@ lie@@ us , if the same system goes with people . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ doc capacity in Dr. Luisa Cerv@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it turned out that a group of studies such cells had such cells , but another group of the same trunk that had not been accommodated . &quot;
they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi , usually live in the g@@ astro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the stra@@ in@@ me of the mice were found DNA @-@ sequ@@ en@@ ades and found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells , but without them in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were raised in a steri@@ le environment so that they were lacking a intestinal micro@@ bi@@ om , and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells , and they received the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how the bacteria carried out on the immune system , the researchers S.@@ reu@@ ter@@ i have grow in a liquid and then over@@ took small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on incomplete immune cells , which were isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the intolerance .
&quot; when the active component of the liquid was cleans@@ ed , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ met@@ abol@@ ism that is known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 @-@ l@@ actic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers double the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the for@@ age of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ uses were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Cerv@@ antes Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice , and that most of us L. reu@@ ter@@ i to protect our g@@ astro@@ intestinal diseases . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ secondary products consist of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to develop cells in people like mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with anti @-@ inflammatory bo@@ wel disease . &quot;
&quot; she said : &quot; &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ us values can result in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i to expand this population .
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic has committed a &quot; genius &quot; to
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid@@ fiel@@ der player on Wednesday night had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million Po@@ unds of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup begins on Tuesday , and impres@@ sing in the holder role as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira . &quot;
&quot; MA@@ TIC was however excluded from the Pre@@ view @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho was obliged to improve it before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later to be ready .
beside M@@ atic also Victor Lin@@ del@@ a and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u in the Avi@@ va Stadium as M@@ our@@ in@@ ho will be his start @-@ XI for the start of the season .
&quot; the Independent was revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho had three additional new commitments , but he ins@@ isted that the club has already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfill three of his four priority commitments . &quot;
&quot; three of them to get , for this I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happier if they were four out of four , but they have given great effort . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S.@@ -@@ aircraft manufacturer has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew at Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers about the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
to be on the radar loops was the form of a Dream@@ lin@@ ers .
the whole thing was a di@@ version for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .
new drau@@ ght for Martin Schulz - Hannover - we have a problem
&quot; as the wind blows at : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , S &amp; D Prime Minister has always been to Berlin with a certain concern to Berlin . &quot;
&quot; merely no stor@@ ks from the party central , merely no head@@ wind from the Bund - so the most important desire for the voting fighter . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz , the party has changed the fundamental change . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt to @-@ house have been watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what has been received from there since the beginning of the year , with head@@ winds , would not even be described in the approach . &quot;
there were stag@@ gering .
and one after another .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of SPD and Green . &quot;
&quot; this shows once more : red @-@ green can simply not reign , &quot; &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary @-@ General Peter Tau@@ ber to the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; the surprising frac@@ tional form of a Greens , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has over@@ thrown into a severe crisis . &quot;
five months before the country @-@ election he lost its red @-@ green coalition with its 1 @-@ voice @-@ majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP .
the Green @-@ Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has called on the tr@@ acked Nieder@@ säch@@ sische Greens @-@ MPs El@@ ke T@@ west to return their mandate .
the crossing to CD@@ U means a clear version of the elec@@ torate .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ west must immediately give its mandate to its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive and election fle@@ a of the Greens of the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; that must not all be true , si@@ gh an SPD Ele@@ ction Warri@@ or , when on Friday afternoon the new Hi@@ obs@@ message reaches the party headquarters . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD @-@ Prime Minister of Nieder@@ sachsen , stands after crossing the Green Members El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government multip@@ ly . &quot;
it is the temporary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades moved at the time . &quot;
&quot; following the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
it was then too - and it all became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the bar@@ ge , the Düsseldorf @-@ Ple@@ ite Haute the Party . &quot;
the comrades have returned to the weeks after the comrades in the weeks .
&quot; then , when she had just finished new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next drau@@ ght .
&quot; Mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD state , lost its Nim@@ bus in that weekend , because he sat in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burned . &quot;
and because he did pretty much everything in crisis communication about what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z fights for political survival . &quot;
so now Stephan Wei@@ l is also available .
&quot; because of the VW , car@@ bure@@ aux and its role in the Supervisory Board , the German @-@ Sax@@ on prime minister has already been in criticism for some time . &quot;
mi@@ ese re@@ frac@@ tures were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because , Wei@@ l tried more and more strongly in recent weeks , in the federal government . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the former mayor of Hanover , to develop his power in Berlin , was not hidden by Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him give it because it spoke out of Wei@@ l a stabili@@ zation of the party .
&quot; well , the exact opposite could happen . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l makes no fault in the principle of internal constraints of the German @-@ Sax@@ on Greens . &quot;
and Schulz was not at all .
&quot; at times , the comrades strive to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Greens , and here above all on the comfor@@ ting parliament@@ arians T@@ ops . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ arable and democratic , such as Ms T@@ west presents their own career paths over the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Chief of the Par@@ liam@@ entary Par@@ liam@@ entary Party ( R@@ ND ) , the editorial network of Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs T@@ west is not elected because of her personality as a direct candidate , but on the national list of the German @-@ Sax@@ on Greens , so the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische MEP . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , Chief of the SPD parliamentary group , compl@@ ained a &quot; non @-@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the elec@@ torate in four years ago was clear : people have Stephan Wei@@ l for the Prime Minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Nieder@@ säch@@ sische SPD to the Bundestag in the Bundestag , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career progression of a future CD@@ U parliament@@ arians from the election result , &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called to clear the background .
I want to know if there had been more or given it further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for Ort@@ k@@ ers III
who wants to san@@ ship in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , the mayor of Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives pon@@ der city development on Wednesday in delicate . &quot;
at the beginning of the information event Sch@@ in@@ dler gave again a review of the previous events .
since 1991 it has been in sensitive san@@ itation areas .
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the award . &quot;
in the refurb@@ ishment II of 2005 to 2016 the allowance was still at 60 percent .
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the present sanctions are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is ultimately important to further develop the internal development , and not only develop new building areas . &quot;
on April 4 I received the information on the Government of the Government of Karlsruhe that there will be a re@@ organisation III .
&quot; the Bank covers 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 euros were received from the country , the rest of the municipality . &quot;
how is a san@@ ction ?
&quot; I will continue to examine as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role whether in the planned area were interest at all . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the territory may also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the jet@@ ty stood on Wednesday evening Martin cellar , Gab@@ y Pi@@ es@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal government program &quot; &quot; Social City , &quot; in whose framework the re@@ organisation would then be performed . &quot;
&quot; core of the program are the revit@@ alisation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , which is called per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be defined as stat@@ ute .
the eligi@@ bility period for funding is running since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; even until September of this year , however , the stock exchange would only be carried out at once , as part of those involved in the re@@ building area . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the pro@@ posi@@ tional clause should be carried out as possible thus in the coming year with the sanctions . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ es@@ sch@@ mann , stated that any Commune must be carried out in the Commune . &quot;
&quot; it is about evaluating and decide the urban planning of the city , and decide when it is re@@ ated and to what extent . &quot;
for the particular property there will also be a re@@ organisation in the Basic Paper .
&quot; Pi@@ es@@ sch@@ mann will come again once again , and get an impression of the situation she spoke . &quot;
&quot; stressed , a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants . &quot;
this is why there will be questionn@@ aires which will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and plot &quot; &quot; unit , in which it is related to the building condition and san@@ itation views . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; household and housing , &quot; can be made to size , distribution and residents of a living room . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; bow &quot; &quot; is to be filled only if the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , it is noted that Got@@ tar@@ ts pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not beneficial . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler stressed that the distribution of funding for the &quot; wind ho@@ isting &quot; &quot; - who comes first , ad@@ mon@@ ed first . &quot;
&quot; you could not reserve a funding fee for later &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; Local II &quot; were shown to make the present a house@@ cleaning &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor makes himself a micro@@ chip in order to come up with a hand@@ movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country , which is equipped with a micro @-@ chip , so that he can open up his front door , enter his office and even launch his car . &quot;
&quot; North@@ am , 33 , had im@@ pl@@ ated the tiny chip between thum@@ b and foref@@ inger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory shop in the Royal Hamp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cats and dogs im@@ pl@@ ated micro @-@ chi@@ pped and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; North@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now built at home as well as with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House in the tax@@ payers thousands
&quot; the decision of the White House , a Marine @-@ Hel@@ icop@@ ter to fly the South La@@ wn for an event that reduces the American production last month , costs tax@@ payers to the data of the military that have been entrusted to TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24.@@ 000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky v@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , the cent@@ er@@ piece of the event was on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and leader of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter @-@ helicopter was issued in addition to a yacht from Maine , a fire@@ car from Wisconsin and a for@@ kli@@ fts from Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; the military office of the White House slo@@ wed the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or F@@ RA@@ GO , barely 36 hours before the helicop@@ ters landed on the South La@@ wn , following the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter S@@ quad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted that you are aware of it because it is an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event in his superi@@ ors , the Deputy Prime Minister for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on July 17 at 7 am in the morning at the South La@@ wn for the event at 15@@ am , and so long stayed until the lawn was cleared from 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , due to the restriction of the hours a second team would need for the flight back . &quot;
the original flight application was during the event at the helicopter while the security personnel remained in the unit during the time on the plane .
&quot; from the records made available from the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight application was required . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ atch Act provides federal , state @-@ owned property for political purposes . &quot;
data sets indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked if the event could hurt the purpose .
&quot; one question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you are locked , &quot; &quot; answered the Deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not be covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus for the reform of the health reform reform that was going on in the Senate , and he ranked the efforts to cur@@ v@@ ature the rule of government rules . &quot;
&quot; the use of the airplane that is known as Marine One or Air Force One , which is politically advantageous purposes is hardly any new phenomenon . &quot;
President is obliged to use them for travel .
&quot; however , their use can only demand for a photo @-@ operation is unusual . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump led an investigation in February as the Presidential plane in the background of his first Kamp@@ ag@@ nen@@ r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of announcements that compl@@ ained about the use of the Presidential aircraft by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is enthusiastic about the show &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 states will be produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lin@@ d@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 Occup@@ ation often lead training trips around Washington and South La@@ wn , in order to aver@@ t the US President in the White House with precise tim@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; as tr@@ ump in early July on the G20 level in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 conducted in the White House 58 exercises . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event in the training needs of the flight application for the month , said a be@@ amer . &quot;
helicopter @-@ units flew 11 hours to this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support . &quot;
&quot; the White House said that the tax@@ payers were the burden to none of the other pro@@ ps , which were presented at the event . &quot;
&quot; said a speaker from Si@@ kor@@ sky , the company had not been involved to put the helicopter on the South La@@ wn . &quot;
&quot; MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget terms for the presidential elections , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Ministry of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the DO@@ D @-@ expenditure for the v@@ H @-@ 3D amounts to 24.@@ 380 USD per hour &apos;s drive . &quot;
record of the unit lists the flight time of the aircraft at 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Cor@@ ps Air Facility in Qu@@ an@@ tico in Virginia .
the White House argued that the actual cost of running the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the costs for tax@@ payers to set on the basis of the estimates for the refund is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; this estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the revenues for DO@@ D do not contain human resources cost , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press secretary of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ icer , the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present these week things that are produced in America , &quot; said Sp@@ S . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state is Connecticut very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think , like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters , and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirel@@ ess@@ ly . &quot;
of course it is appropriate to be emphasized .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump will interact with the helicopter , when he entered the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire@@ cars . &quot;
in the White House Tr@@ ump attended representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and followed with the media on his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

&quot; despite having five games still mak@@ ell@@ os@@ er &apos;s record , the leader of the second tennis league has received the sense of reality . &quot;
teamwork Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has no respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; just in the back positions , I find the crew very well . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at Su@@ chs@@ dor@@ fer S@@ V , the imports from the high North . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to events in the Davis Cup .

how America can harm the O@@ MV
&quot; really happy , Donald Tr@@ ump did not , when he sat on Wednesday his signature under the law for the ti@@ ghtening of sanctions against Russia . &quot;
&quot; in his ha@@ ste , to en@@ act the law , the congress was packed a few &quot; constitutional provisions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels sp@@ ear@@ ted against the US . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft is facing to pun@@ ish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors of the domestic O@@ MV are concerned , which together with other European companies are co @-@ financed by the construction of the Russian Eastern Slovakia Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ ul@@ isse is tremendous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;

Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el in the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x moved to the center
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the season three and four have already been confirmed by the Streaming Service , the first received its first trailer and showed the show up to date . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful pas@@ sions , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une @-@ 500 @-@ Company &quot; only with more governmental forces and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ bi@@ ela ( Damian Alc@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ guez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) comm@@ its the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;

role back@@ wards : the city provides 46 kitchen grants
the city organized the K@@ ita @-@ mid@@ section itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
the watch is turned back in the city &apos;s urban centres .
&quot; for September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the urban day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) again in equity . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ se , Vice @-@ president in the Department of Youth aid , this is a good news : &quot; we all have been very pleased . &quot;
&quot; cooked , furthermore , except house : a Cat@@ erer takes over this task and delivers freshly cooked . &quot;
&quot; the town runs in the center of 46 children &apos;s areas , in 44 children get a warm meal for lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last kite year , 2@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile there are not only children who are taken care of 45 week@@ days , in the K@@ ita for lunch , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour care when children up to 2 pm .
&quot; 46 sub @-@ term staff have from 1st September kitchen service : you have to warm up the meals , supplement them to salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tion@@ ing the meal individually , give the food out , rooms , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two group@@ ed groups as well as seventy @-@ party institutions - decide on the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen @-@ hel@@ pers belong now to the K@@ ita @-@ Team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; so they are involved a lot more closely and it is easier to implement pedago@@ gies , educational concepts . &quot;
it is also about having a healthy diet and a cooking lesson .
the children should help to prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen &apos;s team is there .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known force in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not ever @-@ changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
the pur@@ ge of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done in the future by special cleaning personnel .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , it also has the charm that they have placed themselves in the cost of ownership and foreign nation@@ alization for the city as the most economical solution , it is said from the press . &quot;
&quot; and that , even though 46 sub @-@ forces are newly set . &quot;
&quot; but these hours fall at around 750 people in the education area not so strong in weight , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women in the United Nations .
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN @-@ mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ sho@@ ok , deputy head of the mission of the United Nations , said that hundreds of women joined the council elections in the provinces . three women are enco@@ ding to the role of vice @-@ president and over 30 percent of the newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can be only really representative and credible when women are fully participating and involved in all parts of the election process .
Afgh@@ an elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on April 5th .
&quot; the Taliban have released threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international battle treatments to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will be fully passed by a democratically elected government to the next time . &quot;
Hay@@ sho@@ m said a strong role for women to strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an independent voting Commission reported that 1.2 million women registered in a total of registered 1,@@ 6 million voters . &quot;

GM@@ B concern for investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie @-@ Fabrik in Glasgow
a union wants to unite with managers of the Bis@@ se @-@ producer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie on the long @-@ term commitment to production in their work in Glasgow .
GM@@ B Scotland said the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which besides other products are hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owners Pla@@ dis said , he has invested more than 5 million pounds over the last few years . &quot;
&quot; he added that employees and trade unions should &quot; &quot; learn &quot; &quot; as the first if their activities would change . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the seriousness of the company , GM@@ B Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s called for &quot; concerns to express &quot; concerns that financing for the modernisation of production lines will not be promoted . &quot;
&quot; GM@@ B @-@ Senior organizer Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ ard , our members are deeply concerned . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here , and the workers concentrate strongly on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ xit , the rising cost of life and of the chronic production process , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently recommends a thri@@ ving production policy at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ person from Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the Fili@@ alle@@ ans at T@@ oll@@ cross has only received a letter from GM@@ B Scotland , and the company will respond directly to that , as we estimate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago we had a regular meetings with employees and GM@@ B representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that we operate like all companies , operating in a highly competitive and uns@@ afe economic environment , have continuously checked our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to be competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross @-@ site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as production site full and completely . should our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union officials will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has the PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago from Ne@@ ym@@ ar ?
the side of La League likes to regret their interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Germain won &apos;t leave in its pursuit of Ne@@ ym@@ ar after spending an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to redeem its free@@ ass@@ ay clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years before the empire ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer , because the lig@@ ue 1 @-@ Klu@@ b is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous mark , with Paul Pog@@ ba in the last season , for 89 million pounds to Manchester United returned . &quot;
&quot; after completion , Ne@@ ym@@ ar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional sports@@ men of the world . PS@@ G offers wages of more than 500,000 GB@@ P per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way that Ne@@ ym@@ ar has forced its way outside , although a source in the proximity of the Catal@@ ans Board ins@@ ists that the club has always given its best to take care of it since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president in front of this prospect ?
&quot; Manchester City 2014 interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for any association who wanted to sign one of the best players by PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all the clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club was expressed interest in the PS@@ G @-@ Central field Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made clear that they would not allow it to the International from Italy , under any circumstances , and Barcelona could sense the consequences of this interest by lost one of their price offers for Ne@@ ym@@ ar . &quot;

interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen @-@ Report &quot;
the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen report on the abuse of abuse off@@ rat@@ a Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report on the mis@@ used sc@@ andal over the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen continues for discussion .
&quot; Christian Weis@@ acher , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; stated after the publication of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur , he acquired by the former Rain@@ s@@ bishop and present Cardinal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of St. Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would be expressed deep about its own sub@@ s@@ als or their at that time wrong evaluation of the operations .
&quot; in contrast , the Vatican &quot; &quot; Os@@ serv@@ atore Rom@@ ano &quot; &quot; is critici@@ zed that in reporting about violence at the cathedral sp@@ at@@ zen with &quot; tw@@ o@@ fold measure &quot; will be measured . &quot;
&quot; regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt nobody knows that it would have to be prevented &quot; sh@@ ame@@ ful and sh@@ ame@@ ful acts ; but the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Mani@@ pulation , &quot; said the &quot; degree of medi@@ al Mani@@ pulation , &quot; the author of Lu@@ c@@ etta Scar@@ aff@@ ia , historians and a member of the National Bi@@ eth@@ ic Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of the all @-@ day experience and is preparing the public opinion that for normal &quot; , &quot; writes Scar@@ aff@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis said in an interview with Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk : &quot; &quot; you are happy to go to the church and this is un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , she pointed out that in her youth &quot; bat &quot; have been a very normal pedago@@ gical means &quot; &quot; to be ready with friends as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s unfair to adopt today &apos;s standards for past decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was often appeared . &quot;
&quot; completely wrong , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who spoke with R@@ atz@@ inger the reminder &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; ( translated in 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection , &quot; says Ez@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he adds the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that issued by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with En@@ ligh@@ tenment commissioned Mr. Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of attacks , 67 domin@@ sp@@ at@@ zen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it says to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was employed from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : &quot; in summary , therefore , that it was applied by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. in many cases forms of physical and psych@@ ic violence . &quot;
&quot; especially with a high level of Emoti@@ on@@ ality , const@@ ancy for the students could also be violent . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other alleg@@ ations that many victims of R. are estim@@ able and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with him . &quot;
in the interview Ez@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse of the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was un@@ loaded in his opinion .
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ Pages report on the &quot; incidents of violence &quot; at the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen &quot; &quot; gives a conflic@@ ting picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; for one , many students stand out his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and Perf@@ ect@@ ant who was hand@@ held to the oil when a domain has had no top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate as his bi@@ ograp@@ her this final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : if you feel the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back then you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger occurs at all in it .
he has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspi@@ cion of medi@@ ter@@ - or co @-@ knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse .
&quot; also , the acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool finds itself outside of its sphere of activity . &quot;
you can see him at best to know of it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough .
&quot; the dom@@ ici@@ le ven@@ ing school , on which he worked , was perceived by practically all the respon@@ dents as &quot; &quot; Lord &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; Heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also exhibits an excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; sincerely &quot; , &quot; &quot; honest , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understand@@ ably , &quot; the guys regularly enriched with cakes , bis@@ cuits and b@@ bons and always en@@ camp@@ ed by grapes of children . &quot;
&quot; only a minority compl@@ ained about its perfec@@ tionist and its high emotional originality , which also resulted in W@@ ut@@ aus@@ sian . &quot;
&quot; he did not only crack with chairs and threw the key b@@ und on the ground , but also ear@@ thy guys in the hair or ears , he has already existed for years ago , deeply de@@ pl@@ ated and apologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; to his honor of honour , however , must be said that such education methods have been widely used in the questionable period , the 1960s and 1970s . &quot;
do you also know such breeding @-@ methods ?
&quot; of course , I think each of us who was born in 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a se@@ cular school , a state g@@ ymnasium . &quot;
&quot; compared to what is actually happening in this report , namely the irre@@ plac@@ eable sexual abuse and the acts of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , they are certainly dre@@ d@@ ging of dre@@ d@@ ging . &quot;
&quot; one wonders if it is not to do with his profile , and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just rus@@ hed to him . &quot;
&quot; at the Bav@@ arian Pope , many who have never understood him , still are doing di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report dra@@ fted Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the report was very much reported on the subject of abuse in the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in the final report also given any involvement or co @-@ knowledge in regard to sexual abuse on the load ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : very clearly no .
no one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the car@@ ap@@ master crafts@@ man .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I have never dar@@ ed to talk with my father or my mother about it , &quot; &quot; said a du@@ ti@@ led substitute for the others , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrassing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real issue in educ@@ ating sexual abuse , and is , however , that most victims are not silent . &quot;
&quot; if she didn &apos;t even trust parents and si@@ blings , then certainly not a choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen student R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in regard to the abuse of abuse ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : an un@@ question@@ ably student formulated it so : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have been able ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) and could have had the respective perpetrators .
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd , to accept that after him ... Bu@@ ben pus@@ hy or more clear or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confidence instruc@@ tors etc . &quot;
that one speaks to him about sex ... - un@@ thin@@ kable . &quot;
&quot; thus the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the students involved in advance and / or their environment were entrusted with the investigation , could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; regarding what sexual abuse is concerned , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore free from any fellow @-@ knowing . &quot;
&quot; thus , he cannot be accused of having prevented him or put it on display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , there was a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; with the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was presented in the report &quot;
must he live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge mel@@ ange from sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is precisely the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean separated : between the pres@@ ch@@ ool and the g@@ ymnasium of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence , as well as , we say once , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , thus also from four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral conductors . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible testing pedago@@ gy , the cases in which l@@ ad of legendary teachers were cl@@ ums@@ y and mal@@ ign@@ ated and are all un@@ zi@@ pped , un@@ event@@ ful at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous states have to prevail . &quot;
&quot; but with them , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he got the boys first to face , when they were already on the scr@@ ap@@ ing school . &quot;
&quot; on what was , like most witnesses emphasize , the subject &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; tab@@ u . &quot;
it was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; heavenly &quot; states .
what was different from the scr@@ ap@@ ing school ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : there has been discipline though but is not a sa@@ vi@@ cious force .
&quot; and this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report comes to the conclusion that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. , and therefore in numerous cases , despite violence even positive memories with it . &quot;
&quot; thus , at the most still the accus@@ ation to have seen . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( as the witness ) did not want to hear , and then again at 1993 . &quot;
only Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently the ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Fabri@@ c Gymnasium , who even reproduced the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he pointed out that , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school , he will continue to be practiced . &quot;
&quot; already in view of the danger of negative press @-@ media , he recommended urgent opening . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when the legal clarity was , when he was recently banned in Bavaria too . &quot;
&quot; before that , they un@@ settled in a legal gray area , as each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate correctly where the persons involved were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dram@@ ati@@ zed , and where really the per@@ missible border was exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but one can also not say , he always had looked at . &quot;
this is simply not true .
only in 1980 the inspec@@ tors at schools were officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria .
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Taxis did well , it &apos;s unfair to apply the current educational standards to the time period . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we have been talking of &quot; &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; thus the danger of the past to present moral standards . &quot;
then the princess has already been right .
&quot; but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , who was des@@ pic@@ able at all times and also not for what was broken in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of resistance and violence to inno@@ cent children &apos;s education , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
this is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally working .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment , so ear @-@ co@@ ves and in the hair and ears to pull , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , it was then strictly forbidden . &quot;
&quot; what image of his Regen@@ sburger is represented by George R@@ atz@@ inger because in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the topic come to language too ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , so Pope Benedi@@ k@@ ts XV@@ I. , tells about his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen played just a secondary role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not believe that there was a stric@@ ter rule there . &quot;
&quot; but even that must be said : without this perfec@@ tionist , without the demand of un@@ condition@@ ned discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world tran@@ ts , true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition , which went straight to the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and bon@@ anza alone , one does not make a big singer and stand before every success , regardless of what territory , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger with the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and in addition I met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger really well and again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , fundamental , deeply believers and heart@@ felt people from which one could not imagine that he could just do something to do something . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get along with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen still keep in contact with him today , 23 years after his empowerment , please visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strict with them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lovely dis@@ respect , to which they still look at it and to honor them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clear : all that you pre@@ e@@ jects , are gu@@ ardi@@ ans methods that were then on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man , just because he has promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medi@@ al scap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the nasty intention , which is behind it all too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which was just published , rel@@ ayed him . &quot;
&quot; now , the standing area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man , who has acquired great service to his merits , and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regen@@ sburger Dom@@ sp@@ at@@ zen to finally leave peace . &quot;
