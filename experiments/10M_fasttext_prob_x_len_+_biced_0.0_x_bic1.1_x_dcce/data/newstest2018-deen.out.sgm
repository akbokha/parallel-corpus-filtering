<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards to change your sight on the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt is where young people will encounter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"a gracielle, which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel."</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners provide for the cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It's nervous when landing cards are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">"that knows everyone who had already had an upright position, because the car Navi took place instead of a circumring road a green meadow."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of geoportas Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but just therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online cards.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it becomes clear, how cities and churches have changed in the spread-area of Munich's Merkur since the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a splattered canvas that one does not recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large transfer card have been incorporated for cities and municipalities for detailed maps, so-called urine sheets."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created in accordance with the Bayerisches Committee management between 1810 and 1864 and skipping of the first measurement of Bayerns.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">French army carriers occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during World War II war.</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wished an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic recording of Bayerns - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"finally, when the French troops went off with the peace of Lunéville from 9 February 1801: there were today's neighbours who created the idea of a nationwide Bavaria-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph was driving forward the project moving forward, established the" "topographical Bureau" "- and thus the Bayerische surveying administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The focal sheet for Munich comes from the year 1856 and is like all others to be found on the Bayerische Staatsbibliothek.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison morning / Today is the example of the state capital at the most impressive.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded throughout all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example of this is subverdling, which appears in the map of 1856 rather isolated."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was transferred 21 years after the creation of the map, so 1877, as a Munich city district."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Subsendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of shelter concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße which was named after 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the insurrection of Bavarian peasants against Austria 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the Westpark is, you can see nothing but fields - at first glance: at the Hinder zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers: handwriting numbered plots from the so-called" "jungle" "from which the base tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small plots from there are no farmers no longer - but small gardeners of the plant "Land in Sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is situated north of the subverdling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, since 1810 locales of the October Revolution, was in the 19th century actually a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">On the other side of the Isar the historical map gives an insight into the history of mental medicine.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the judgment sheet, one reads in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen not only reads the street name" "Gasteig" "or of the hill" "On the air" "but also in big letters" Irren Anstalt "." "</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstrasse, one once pushed people with madness."</seg>
<seg id="33">There was 1858 / 59 the Münchner district-Irrenanstalt on the Auer Lünen. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard from Gudden took up the institution - that psychiatrist was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig's II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and for example, the chains of so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he is forbidden to use the staff to apply violence against the inmates," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum of Haidhausen who has occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"initially, for 280 patients had been a first place, later it was expanded to 500 sites."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the county-penitator in hair 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"there has been the Isar-AMPER-Klingenum Munich-East, one of Germany's largest psychiatry in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="40">On the site of former Auer Anstalt now meet young people in Munich's Salesianum.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and turned it into a teenager with training courses.</seg>
<seg id="42">West is the football ground of the TSV Munich East, east of the buildings in the 1980s. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children-house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in an architectural approach to the country of origin of the Irrenia, which had been destroyed during the Second World War in Bombenanattacked."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was in 1856 as" main square "," the department name was called "" Puringer Gasse "." "</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The bombs from the Allies in December 1944 lots of holes in the city center.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English institute, small business houses and a pit-chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof, where these days work the pre-bite and on 5 April 2017 the ground-bite for the second S-Bahn."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, the old Munich map will be compared to the aerial picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights group released travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The national association for the promotion of coloured colored has issued a warning for colored people that travel to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory Board for the federal state of Missouri, which will take place until 28 August 2017, calls for afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, since a number of fragmented, racial-based pre-based cases occur in the whole state and here, it is said in the opinion of the group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder to win Discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state, the disproportionate to minorities, prompted the group to recover the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">"they have violations of civil rights, people happen."</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are kept because of their skin colour, they will be assembled or killed," "said the President of Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star."</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such an incidence that we have not yet heard.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organisation for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the Group quoted as racist forks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after having no gasoline on the country had no gasoline, and taken by the police of Missouri, being accused of being accused of any crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recently published report by Missouri, in which black drivers in the state will be 75 per cent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri,"</seg>
<seg id="62">People need to be prepared to bring Caution money or to know relatives that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">Missouri posted 100 hate-hate in 2015 after the latest figures from the hate-hate report of the FBI which entered the state in terms of the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country.</seg>
<seg id="64">The travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law which would make it harder to complain a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil liberties union (ACLU) travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, having passed the states of immigration law, the local criminal law enforcement authorities to commit to people because of immigration law will contribute to further aggravation."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel alerts are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but lately, stakeholders have been using the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The Weirenaunching project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing bacher Weideenchn project is a project project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU Parliamentary Party Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have created an image on site.</seg>
<seg id="70">In the castle grabenhof the Schwendemann family met representatives of the fisher CDU local associations with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially granted insights into his farm, in which he is located 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 milk-cows and as many kittens and housed in five apartments holiday homes."</seg>
<seg id="72">"the" "black-milk" "is for him the alternative marketer for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengaeste only occurs regionally.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Menbach, he called the" "elementary project" "as" elementary "." "</seg>
<seg id="75">I can not profitably manage on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area for much work, a lot must be edited using the motor sense."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have here to fight with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">In 2003 he took over the eleventh operation and cultivated these without chemical plant protection and fertilizers even if they do not lead bio-operation.</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor, Thomas Schneider was clear:" "the Commune has recognised the importance of the turnaround project, and is pleased with the leader."</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare, the farmers need to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">"I hope, so that the forestation of the areas could be gone up for quite a while."</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have, are the people who work in agriculture and make thought about how they continue to put their business," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">Farmers are often in criticism because of their funding</seg>
<seg id="84">"over the course of the course of the settlement, 25 plots were fenced in 2013 by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">The disclosure area is thus 40 hectares which can not be afforested until at least 2023.</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of which was funded over Leaders, a quarter performed the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers love 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers pasture."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," stated Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and women it does not go."</seg>
<seg id="90">"for Peter white stood firm," "Here are the best food produced."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscapes of Landscapes (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state promotion of women-fence.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is the Entenure of the Black-alds.</seg>
<seg id="93">The requirement is the presence of one of the LPR drawn conveyor belts.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the inferous surface may not be indurable (Hangouts over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the forestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the fishery Weirenaunt project 2018, the application of eight participants is currently running with 24 plots, which would like to build up to 16 kilometers fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump takes the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime switch is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos place in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, didn't know what he did when he took a symbolic Axt in a hitent argument with Jim Acosta by CNN about the proposals of the President to the drastic limitation of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and liberty-Imites would have denied him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he laid their significance, and in particular the meaning that it was written, when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta described:" I don't want to enter a full thing about story, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem which you relate to which later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is proper to properly, but as he formed it himself, it is not really about story."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the touching words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" thy tists, your poor, and your oppressive masses who crave to breathe free, / the miserable waste of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable waste" was better seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">"Miller did not get involved in literary criticism, making it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps."</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural examination: it is indeed a conflict with the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">Lazarus and her friends who put themselves to place their words on their death on the base - knew very well that she has accomplished a high-political action.</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show links between French and American republicanism by presented the feminine image of freedom in an unused classical exposition.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the feminine figure is no longer abstractly - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives himself a completely different name: mother of exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The connection of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist Coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just like Lazarus the importance of the statue changed, people wanted to change from the right wings for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great cry of Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is one, but rather an early neo-conservative that puts the American flame into the ummed world:" lady Liberty is proceeding. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is said to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Quite unusual is Limbaugh here on a bit pushed.</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is completely and at all a matter of point of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative effect of Lazarus consisted in it, as they see from the exhaustive, miserable, but hopeful men after lengthy and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"it is in the truest sense of seeing the world from the perspective of men to look for refuge, and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Their statue talks to them the words of hope and the welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is of course not the perspective, the Miller and Trump will ever wish to recognise."</seg>
<seg id="127">"her torch should not illuminate the way, but the hatred, who is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World championship 2017: Neil Black and inherited Scottish members of the UK</seg>
<seg id="129">Eiliie Doyle remembers a time when only two bottles were part of the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the Leichtaletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member of the World Cup camp will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of shoottic athletes selected for London 2017, which will start on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"Black believes that in Scotland some special things developed, and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we figure it out," said Black. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think that something has to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they did.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">Whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliantly. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals-contenders, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - which compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5.000 m line, while Eiliie Doyle was elected by the team for teamleader."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eiliie is fairly modest,"</seg>
<seg id="141">"their captain's speech was amazing," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, no matter whether they were Scottish or train, they went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feel that Eiliie was quite natural, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth of Silver Medal wins, which is in the fifth World Championship in the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 scots are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">Scotland's best total on athletes at the World Championship has been seven in 1983 and 2015.</seg>
<seg id="146">The midstretch-winged Muir leads along this path and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 square and the 5,000 m."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, the 1.500 m walks, is another Scotsman that was included in the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">"Doyle remembered her first world Championships, when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "" on the fact that many of their compatriots do not only belong to the team, but in some cases also with the medals and the Finals. "</seg>
<seg id="151">"the speciality is to be team captain in that she was chosen by the other members of the team, so it's been a great honor to know, but to know that my team-mates voted for me and chose to have something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">"obviously, I am very proud of all the villi that belong to the team."</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we came.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to rise to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain for him?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation since we have a home World Championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">"it is therefore really important to put on this way support and benefit, we are back in the Olympiastadion."</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go there and compete and it's just going to be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics via Facebook: filling yourself not a public office if you can't wear the local voters.</seg>
<seg id="161">The Father of our country knew something of bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long until the newspapers beat him because of everything, from domestic politics to his political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">He impeed in criticism.</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not put his critics to silence.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783 Washington said," "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led to the sheep to the slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to the Governor Larry Hogan, who has to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil liberties set him therefore at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Stab of the Governors left the lawsuit as Frivol, and the online comment was full of a counterreaction with" "Na," "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it is only Facebook," said many people. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a guy like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state who is astounding.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the highest highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very skillful to use Facebook as the primary means to connect to his voters and to debating his haired head to chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of individuals who come to the site of the Governors - which is a public forum that is officially designated and by employees who are paid with public taxes - needless and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans Sprecherin Amelia Chasse the actions of the Governors and argued that the blockage of comments is nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">"but it is too simple to use the image of trolls or spamming or hwater-filled people, which resonate online the whip."</seg>
<seg id="181">The mail spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders, a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">They all said that their comments were respectful and thoughtfully and not profane.</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor crucified the Bible in his post and called to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"attorney Lakshmi Sarma Ramani by Bowie, Md., was not hitting, but she asked to break down."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate hate and other current news, she wrote in the commentary area of the message" "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea if a number of people take place at the same subject, then they are regarded by some more so-so-called collective action and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the employees of the Governors signed as" "concentrated spam attacks" "would probably call" "intercede". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">"the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocked a critic, or deleted a negative comment."</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is a lot cleaner as in previous time, if you have done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical ladders and teach demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But this is exactly what happens.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is complained about Twitter-users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors County is the last Amendment, according to the US District Apostle James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they named a voter on their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Before (R) received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at present, Washington's time had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiply between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous briefing proposed to his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even at that time Washington was anonymous.</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity, the trade and the shipping sector with Britain, have accumulated his ministry, according to the historical documents that were collected by the Online Papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them silenced.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of expression, disagreement and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="1317">The big life live: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned these little Earls Court apartment into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrunk from a large house in Knightsbridge to a Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it's a testament to the new design that Joanne did not have unpacked their bags and sold their bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that, I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I searched for something that was comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and she had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I have fallen in love with them and made a quote on that day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square footage was completely rebuilt."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a snowy layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne-storage space and a mezzanine to best use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose she instructed the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill, which was 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home not only a development, but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms overeach other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which you could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the handing.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," "he explains."</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the spaces so quickly, that they were flacked with each other without having to pick up."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but to define the steel so that he had the right amount for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"this arrangement made it possible to place Erfan, two rooms in full height - with a lot of extra drama."</seg>
<seg id="1335">For the mezzanine looks a classic classy skylight made by Retrouvius across the glamorous living area.</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold-furniture, silberne accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"on both ends, a short basket is mirrored to take him longer work."</seg>
<seg id="1339">The kitchen feels like a window in another room.</seg>
<seg id="1340">At the entrance mirrored units accommodate all the seating and the glasses of Joanne.</seg>
<seg id="1341">"due to the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can connect the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">"the special thing about this is, that it is a garnet door."</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went out there," says Erfan of the stahlreinforced, furnited MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is subject to object, so it is when you upslide the door very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could win an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell floor space - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>

<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new staff leader of the White House, joining his first working day with leading employees, he set a major problem in President Donald Trumps's White House, which he wants to fix: bad information that come into the hands of the President."</seg>

<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to taming trump by monitoring its media dips. "</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trumps's relationship to television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV show is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if candidate Trump was annoyed because of an unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he was a fair reporting of jobs that were to convince," said the former election consultant Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico. "</seg>

<seg id="1403">We will probably never know something about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his staff had made it a few times, to keep anger from him, then their efforts have been worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"however, nobody has consistently been able to prevent Trump controversy."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"a part of the problem is that people in a White House put together from competitive parties, always try to move their own agenda by promoting Trump's material that could possibly promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"poltico - very busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the consultants, the President for strategic reasons of dubious information."</seg>

<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump-officials say that Trump like a volcano can react to negative press sections, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he figure out where these come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this happened at the end of February, when someone accused the president of malicious copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet Provocateurs Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy head office in Katie Walsh," "the source behind a pile of" leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was banned permanently from Twitter because he had no concrete evidence whatsoever, or that he voiced wrong accusations in the past or voke her."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist emphasises the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">The employees of the weekly Riodoce met usually to check their plans for the reporting of the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime to corrupt public officials and unceaseless drug wars.</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to speak about safety."</seg>
<seg id="1812">It has been told to them that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what they feel safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with shells, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"safety experts have written three words to a blackboard at the front of the room: opponent, Neutral, ally."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"you ask the reporter to propose name for each column - no proof is necessary, perceptions and stomach upset."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smuggler, politicians, businessmen, journalists, who are suspected of being on the secret list of government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest break from violence, and while throughout the country the corpses of the corpses are more and more journalists: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto took his office in December 2012. 589 are standing by attacks and threats under Bundesdatenschutz and so far there was at least seven deaths in seven countries."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her publisher and her inspirer from Riodoce, the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest flaw is to live in Mexico and be journalist," wrote Valdez in one of his many books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"its absence is felt deeply, although its presence exists everywhere - a large picture of Valdez, which shows his medium-finger with the word" Justice, "depends on the façade of Riodoce building. two reporters in the thirties, carry T-shirts, who show his smiling face with spectacles or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmare, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although 2010 was established by the Prosecutor's Office in order to edit the cases of journalists, this according to the committee regarding the protection of journalists only introduced two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murder, each year with drug trafficking and organised crime, the murderers of journalists are rarely placed in court."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are intracked and even though the terrain is now more traitated."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting about the discussion of safety little benefits, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very silly to squander my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we know not that, mistrust we all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15th, Valdez left the newspaper of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed just to drive a couple of blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, presumably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" Twelded River. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The cap was driving away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two adults.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to travel freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzmans arrest in last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, since rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people will be shot at the street or that the cemetery is full of noted, two-story mouths for drug labs that are bigger than many houses for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"remember for a minute that there is a state of" peace, "if only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs routes in the United States has."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"nevertheless, despite the fact that Valdez has been aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misconceptions contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February the release of a interview with Damaso Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartonauctions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may be annoyed the children, presumed gangmembers buy any copy of the output, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second fault was to force Valdez, according to the confiscation of another newspaper which had released the same story, leaving the country to its own safety."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues imitate that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003 he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined together with five colleagues for the creation of Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa, it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the dowry problem," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1847">"at the time, the newspaper served a reputation because of courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising participated."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporter loved it to publish hard-in investigations without fear of censorship, and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the formation of Riodoce she received the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for their coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez has won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs history, where ever it lead."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He had voluntarily made that he was afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug dealers in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said in an interview with Rompeviento TV in the last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take the task of taking you as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">"I do not want to ask," What have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on? "</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team mixed Valdez, the fun-bird, who was cursing like a harbour workers, the friend who knew generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in their routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He always would carry his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guaynabo, the bar opposite the office, go and sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"now, ask them: was his love for the routine for his destruction?"</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death has also forced her to question her own assumptions on how to do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they do not like it when you move with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their home and cross-ways", "to employ drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust our own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the trouble is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal, that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing with Javier has happened. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, such as he and others say, are no longer - just as not in Tamas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisoned mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is constantly changing.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days before has been known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, for monitoring journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside sought two policemen protection against the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">"they were commissioned by the provincial government, to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a mid-range area of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers, who referred to the Governor himself."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months ago, since the reporters have gone into the mountain scenery where the drug gangs are actually under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has clicked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an Exposé to the government spending, which concentrated on the home of the Governors."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was one group, which in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor's office, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it came to pass, so it was advisable when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favorite locally on drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"reporter came from public records, that the restaurant was registered under the name of a policy worker, who ruled the governing Institutional Revolution Party (Pri), which ruled nearly all the century all political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">Recently several Pri governors have been accused of high-caliper cases of corruption.</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write over previous incidents in this pub, including one, in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman went to a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">Only a few months ago the readers had seen the Kolumne of Valdez as the most informed source about the kidnapping.</seg>
<seg id="1884">"before we had already knew what happened", "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" El FLACO "because of its slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"the office of Valdez was dedicated to storage space for signs and stickers, dedicated to killing the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected, activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez came a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning to a demonstration because of a further journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body was discovered and officials say, based on DNA testing that it is its."</seg>
<seg id="1890">Journalists all over the country have become vocized by having written them in organized protests "SOS Press" on enclosures and buildings.</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, the director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, the authorities, to pronounce journalists and to leave them, because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked that she is once again divided by the government, because it is worried that their anger has hurt their objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico organized by organised crime to participate in government officials and a uniform society." ""</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" "Narco", "he wrote that reporter would not only be killed by drug gangs, but also on command of politicians and security forces organized with organised crime among a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"over half of the attacks on journalists of police and officials, the media" "Articulo 19" "has been assigned to journalists of the police and officials last year."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico-minded you live, because they want you to keep the mouth," said Ramirez. "</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the murders have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">Nobody forgets the death of the blogger Mary Elizabeth Macias in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">"your body was found along with a note that was supposedly signed by Zetas des Kartell," "Here I am because of my reports."</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer tastatur and earphones aside from their separated head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some stores have chosen to close, as the newspaper El Norte is in the northern border-state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue on like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of their director in 2004 did.</seg>
<seg id="1904">In 2010 the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly announced the drug-cartels with an editorial page on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their homeland states or even out of the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still observe the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they shall be hunted, as apparently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who want to stay away and continue working, it is a daily dance with risome decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be poets, admits that the drug stores put it scared."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce stood on the sidewalk before the office and drank beer, than once all their phones began to work."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A series of shootings with bandages and security guards near the bathed Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed tote.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war has escalated as it was promised by a number of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the on-board edge, they have published the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The front page was needed to change the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens heults in the vicinity - a further slate in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez cast a look at the police officers who held guard to see if they were in readiness.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"when they were afraid, they showed it not."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the tremendous portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose medium-finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff followed by Riodoce followed its footsteps."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you also think of it," "said Bojorquez," "when on the same day that Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send them to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used targeting its enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">At first sight it looks like a statue even if a terrifying.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers found that the first findings of the unbelievable rhinoceros of a Canadian mountain workers were so well received that experts have described it as" Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even notice that his loved skin was blush with reddish, and they said they could have had something of a" "troubled past." ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the magazine" Current Biology, "referred to as" the underlining dinosaurs that has ever been found, and one of the best dinosaurs specimens in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurs, which lived in the middle of the chalk period between 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his incredibly well preserved condition has researchers that describe it as" really remarkable "," astonished "</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports at National Geographic, the armored plant-eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk when he died on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to see more precise."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The Fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"you spent the next six years to uncover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) to uncover serious grounding."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all of this hard work, the finished product is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you are just blinking with the eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is visible. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"in the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs, Mona Lisa is the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers found that this plant-eaters, although he is covered with an armaments, and resembles a changing tanks, probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the strongly armored dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide itself from predators, and used a shielding technology used as a backless, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to mix better into his surroundings and soften its enemies, say experts, which suggests that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaur family has made headlines in May and is now visible in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers now studied the wild animal and it Borealopelta market markers after the Museumsteker Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1942">"the astonishing preservation of the copies, made it possible to document Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists, the pattern and the form of shed and armour on his body."</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shaded, a common defence method in the animal kingdom, meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shaded practice is customary, the results are surprising since the size of borealopelta is by far the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaurs was hunted by sufficient pressure due to meat eating, dinosaurs was hunted that the Evolution favours the decay of the confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most of the contemporary animals that use the counter-shaded areas - think of deer, zebras or girders - are much smaller and hurtful than prey, which signalizes that this Nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predatory behavior on a massive, strong armored dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaurs predators have been the chalk-time," said Brown. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their skins also shows that the skin of the dinosaur is rotor.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on references about his life, including his consistent bomintes, to find out what it has eaten as its last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaurs, when he died, went out into a river and went out into the sea where he sank on the back to the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at this time Alberta was as warm as South fluoride today, and rivers and oceans are likely much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurs is really remarkable because it is completely covered with contested skin, but also in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the beast" "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal today looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you do not need much imagination to reconstruct it. if you're just a little using your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the chalk time was a time, when huge Theropoden, carnivorous dinosaurs stood on two legs, the earth crossed."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaurs was hunted by some of his furtive ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this belongs to the Acrocannosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tonnes of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose recent findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta was versed after the death in the sea and converted into mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he died on March 21, 2011 at Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, grub."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the crowned dinosaurs of the world, including skin and armaments, and is complete from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">The creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and have weighed up to 3.000 pounds (1.300 kg).</seg>
<seg id="1962">"it contained two 20-inch long tips, which raked by his shoulders."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eaters was shaken by Western Canada, until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater burial of the dinosaurs keep his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">"the hidden remnants of this particular specimen are so well preserved, that the skin remains still bumpy tank plates along the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the Lotto."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I see it, the more confusing it gets."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified side of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his rechter leave is on his side, his five fingers are strained up."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="2019">How an activist came to learn the answer to the question: "Whose Streets?"</seg>
<seg id="2020">On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken as far as to their core.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"just one day after she arrived in New York City, who sat in St. Louis in the bed of an airbnb apartment that they rented and scrolling through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled across a post by someone from the High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year child, and it is still on the street," says it there. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, because no one else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was thereby the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black-year-old that was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mon., killed live to tweet."</seg>
<seg id="2027">"he posted a picture of a slice lifeless body, which was stretched on the street and would stay there four hours."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"this is wild," thought Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She put her cell phone to return later in the evening to go to Tweet about people on the Canfield Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people who cried out, and from a man who claimed to be Browns' father, who contributed a sign with the wording:" Ferguson Police has just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live Feed in which a policeman was in front of a group of demonstrators with a barker dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said that another policeman his rifle and cried:" I will kill you... animals all kill you. "</seg>
<seg id="2034">"that is not usual," Ferrel reminded itself about her statement. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder that we have accustomed to and which we can call it typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt Schüttelfrost.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a flight back and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she fetched her 6-year old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, the theme of a new documentary film," Whose Streets? "," in the movie theaters on 11. "</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and Protestes, of love and loss, strength and resistance, which is of the point of view of the people living in the community and filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrel with her daughter, which carried a flower garment and a suitable crown, headed by Ferguson, the two had a conversation that they had lots of times before this morning" "about the black experience and the black condition." "</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember, how I have taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" remember what she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2044">"now we go to Ferguson, because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her away," said Ferrell. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">That which has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It is necessary to know and see it and be reared in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it has to be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the various layers of black experience and the black Constitution and what we need to do to free ourselves to liberate ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"but if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally had not experienced racism, it is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"I have the feeling, I would prove to be a bad service to keep them away."</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station when she arrived in Ferguson, was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which was to a campground when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment by Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags in front of and helped to pass them on demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly began a new kind of activism for Ferrell's shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism has changed completely after August 9th, she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities."</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met at an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said, she and her comrades Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to document" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to mind," "do you document it, or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by numerous cases of people, often by white - in a community, who benefited from their pain and resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan stated recently in an interview:" "we heard that people who were born in Ferguson and raised up their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already worked together with the then co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the field, which is known for his activism around Todd-inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought the project closer together with six other indigenous people followed by the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after browns."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we speak," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"this was the main thing for me, as these people will be presented, because I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was to concentrate on Ferrells' experience - to show that it is not a Messiah leader, but about a community that comes together," said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris life, as she loves and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrel and laughed, when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understood that at this work and in the dehumanization of black people must give a certain vulnerability.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris history repeatedly reiterate the role of black curls women in the broader black-Lives movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, which after the killings of the black teenager Trayfrom Martin in 2012 have shaped the movie" BlacklivesMatter "in social media, identify as swam."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in executive positions have carried the movement altogether," said Ferrell, "and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must carry the main last of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice, that" the movement really maintained between black women and many black women. "</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it exists that" this is not a affirmative type of action, "which has been chosen as the heart of the film because of their identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"it was the person that stirred up this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the front line, because in a life on these crosses when a black, sultry woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"now the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on trial for 2 ½ years because of the blockage of a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">"it describes the sociopolitical atmosphere of the area, which they call their home:" "chaos." ""</seg>
<seg id="2083">Yet she kled to a singing and she feels committed to her memory since she went into Ferguson on the streets three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to "size wahn": TV readers discuss about bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, although it is not yet built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the South-edge of the pedestrian area has been divides the population in proponents and opponents since the first presentation of 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">Cold the issue hardly leaves one.</seg>
<seg id="2092">Even on our Facebook page "Population and Bitburg" the topic is discussed.</seg>
<seg id="2093">"saying one to the bit gallery," that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" "that would be real" (Nicole Schausts), comes from the other side: "" needs no human "" (Siggi Better) or very simple: "" size wahn! "" (Lars Scholz). "</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents are building that a gallery draws more customers into the city, from which the rest of the businesses will benefit, fear that then the pedestrian streets are destroyed."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"added to the property: the gallery is planned exactly on the property, on which the farmland hall is in the 13 direct market-market products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">With the beginning of construction work will eventually be.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Gallery makers want to integrate a markethall in the new building - in addition to the Beda Square, with possibility of sitting outside sitting."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Rooms: "we have been buying almost weekly in the farm hall for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the women always enjoy very happy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher have discovered for us too.</seg>
<seg id="2101">"we would like to see that, during and above all, after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer."</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is the same.</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"Gerd Densing:" "whether a direct market hall is moved to the gallery, comes at the height of the rent."</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should probably not be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what shopping palace in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find it unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">One sees how many shop stores will be empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not yet another weekly market place, it is all the more important that at least keeping us the market hall."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered here are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the manufacturer and is purely inexpensive."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"you can see shop stores in a shopping centre only by larger companies, as the dorsal rents are often not viable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special places there is almost no more and that which is still left, will probably also disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping center with a markethall fits me not together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Especially: where is the agritourism during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the old EDEKA would be the solution - even in the long run, if the bit gallery will eventually come."</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does it create the ghost bit-gallery before to distribute all shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "this will just not work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, does not need any one."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my view, it would have been better to encourage a real farm market instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a peasant hall, it is thanks to the insane many - as I find - meaningless construction projects in Bitburg no longer place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the peasant hall is broken, again a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen tubing and hair sections that you were sent to Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent the excerpts from the prison of Fort Leavenworth where the former secret service analyzer sent a 35-year-old sentence after she publicly declared diplomatic reports on the website of WikiLeaks.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on 2 August, is called A Beef Stblance (An appropriate similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline unified its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and groundbreaking discs, whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithms analysis of DNA, which could be extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits, as anyone with these genomic data could look, a sharp, if something intellectual comment can not only be interpreted by the formation of DNA data - the many ways how they can be interpreted and the indurations determinants of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since their puberty, was condemned 2013 because of 20 charges, including six breaches of the sponageon, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in jail, her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one single photo - a granular, black-white Selfie, in which Manning is visibly sitting on a driver's seat and has a platocrates associated with which it was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">In 2015 Dewey-Hagborg came straight from the great success of their 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'.</seg>
<seg id="2134">In that the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts like cigarette smoke and chewing gum by extracting the DNA out of the waste to make a picture of how these people might look.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when it received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they carried an interview with Chelsea Manning, while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," stated Dewey-Hagborg at a press conference of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not visit this time, and she could not be photographed, so they took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her incarcerated muse were replaced with unequal brilliance, in the course of two years sharing several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created one of Shoili Kanungo illustrated Comic" Suppressed Images, "who would foresee a future in which the President Chelm's judgement would convert and she would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was released, Manning release would demand for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome way of happy coming."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something for opening the exhibition at the opening of the exhibition, and Starkes, da Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government warehouse and against transgender forces, to find new, tweeful paths that he actually should fix, continue to inflame."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things are happening for a given reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in one on the wall of the gallery written down the artistic statement, Manning with its superior description below (the" i "in her family name is provided with a heart) an end to the" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation may have been gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandal sprite from Cs and Gs and As, in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped, with the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotide, according to the highly developed scientific dictionary of the artist), how amazing similar, at least in biological respects, we all are."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works of 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in an independent room, is a page from the aforementioned Comic-Novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows maning as she appears with a hands-hand flon in the hands of the disciplinarkasure of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they put your speech, then they have won," says it. "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter that she wrote me," "said the artist, greeted out of Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">"I still get geese, if I speak about it."</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if they do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulation, which merged like hordes of protagonizing."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also focused on how everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), where their genetic Haploggroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted it to feel like a crowd," Dewey Hagborg said of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement, which formed up with Chelsea, as the movement that tasted behind their liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2224">"if a company is found that his staff is poorly treated or impethically behaves, it can experience precious consequences by consumer boycott, workers and pillows, said Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"Ruby Tuesday, the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations, calculcent has been used for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of policy and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters."</seg>
<seg id="2226">"earlier, if an employee wanted to report a problem, he or she had to submit a phone number or e-mail for the company central to submit a formal complaint and hope he was taken seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"it was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience, said James Vitrano, Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel, who said, there was no good opportunity to follow the complaints of employees."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"now that the company uses Convercent, can be problems that have been hidden in offices in towns or states - such as discrimination, harassment or unspreadability to be identified quicker and addressed."</seg>
<seg id="2229">"I can get closer to this holistic, 360-degree view of experience with employment," said Vitrano, who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2230">"and we protect our shareholders from employment, legal disputes."</seg>
<seg id="2231">"company began to take ethics, values and employees engagement in 2002 after the accountant-company Arthur Andersen was collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal, Quinlan."</seg>
<seg id="2232">"but it took until the" social media "came to their right," that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry. "</seg>
<seg id="2233">"prior to using technology for monitoring ethics, people used hope as a strategy," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2234">"both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service, and load the companies with recurrent fees for the use of their products."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"it is a business model and a chance to find the approval of Venture Capital Investors, who have both start-ups."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"the Convercent received $10 million when financing in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital, which has raised the total capital to $47 million."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"Kitzbühel secured $10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners, and launched its entire financing to $60 million."</seg>
<seg id="2238">"this investment is hardly surprising, given the connected nature of companies, culture and venture capital."</seg>
<seg id="2239">"there is a growing complex of research, which shows that today's employees are expecting more than before."</seg>
<seg id="2240">Competitive markets such as Silicon Valley are high salaries and interesting projects only bets.</seg>
<seg id="2241">Staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission.</seg>

<seg id="2244">"if the analytics tools of third parties promise, commitment and commitment of employees to increase, it is no wonder that you will find support."</seg>
<seg id="2245">The data on employee commitment to the experts of the workplace culture is important.</seg>
<seg id="2246">But the data are useless if the administrator of an enterprise does not take action.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"in fact, if a company asked employees after your feedback, it may have an expectation on the way."</seg>
<seg id="2248">"and if change does not come quickly enough, or not at all, this can grow disappointments and demotiation."</seg>
<seg id="2249">"if you ask for 4,000 suggestions, you must have prepared to have 4,000 talks," said Russell Raath, President of Consulting in Business Management company Kotter International, the company has already left to rely on collecting data. "</seg>

<seg id="2252">And whom should not worry about why should I?</seg>
<seg id="2253">"Madison Reed, which now leads monthly staff surveys, was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"and after collecting feedback from frustrated workers, they were able to reorganise the decision-making and the quality of communication, able to reorganize multiple teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems."</seg>
<seg id="2255">"at Ruby Tuesday, the company always gets new insights on the employees, and it hopes that in the long run, this leads to a better understanding of workers in a sector that is known for high turnover."</seg>

<seg id="2291">In his younger past the little Scotney Castle was shown in a squze music video and was a loophole for her forhatcher in 1970-he and 1980-he years.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history at the Bewl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England 'spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney - Isaac Lenkiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, based on an archive: he wrote in 2014 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter, who was written by a double-car in the 1700-er years, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "this is his thumb-pressure!"</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell to smoke, because at that time one lit a fire because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect, as if he himself."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who beaten up with old papers is that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England, and almost four months lived in a castle (" To be honest:) it all seems too beautiful to be true. "</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, exploring the archives and study the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the monmented hydraulic heads at the walls and the bottles spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"through the grounds and ruins of the ancient castle and spoke to Landscapes, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey "and started writing."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown, as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 as the last Erbin, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"as Rhodes a decade later, the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as" hundreds of years, in which Aristocrates said, "Oh, wires it on the attic."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of English rebellion, cards which represent what possessed," one could mean that land conflict would be boring, "says Rhodes," but there was a pear in order to have fought the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let everything go his way!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to immerse on the broader base in the English history, including 'The Labourer' that leaves a man who leaves the newly built castle, in order to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a mover, which appeared in 1380 in the castle, in this book entitled 'Knife, of Kent and Sussex', says Rhodes."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought, an insurrection was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are connected to each other? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like 'The Priest', which tells the story of the Jesuit patented, who hid the family Darrell seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', represented in that of the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century, when he filled a coffin with stones (a discovery that was made only years later, when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">The Darrells are the Rhodes' favourite family of Scotney: "the masters seemed to be forthright to always make debt and spend money for things they could not afford.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Daral men extinguishes their debt crises by rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good-looking boys, with a talent to advertise Erin."</seg>
<seg id="2318">After the end of his use in the castle Rhodes is looking for another unique write-experiences</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Esmiles, the terrain of a sanatorio from the early 20th century, which since then has been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in the middle of July Erdogan ordered by decree, another 7395 coup, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Yet it seemed that Erdogan the army tamed.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals are formerly the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times putted them under appeal on their role as guardian of the worldly state of affairs.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election on 2002, Erdogan pushed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling for reform of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2388">The rise of sex robotic is real and we should worry</seg>
<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can not be even crazy, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex-robots are currently a great thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robotics in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, emeried Professor for Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR, we have to start to take her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye colour of the robot, its shape of nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people get fun with them, but the companies supplying a lot of them and we will see them much more frequently," "Mr. Sharkey said in the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sexpia have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with aware human reactions which are achieved through artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also adapt its robot according to their beliefs" and select everything from the eye colour of the robot on the shape of nipples to the type or the color of his fingernails. "</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it is still more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities, "which would look a stepford-woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern Sexpandans have developed to robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"for example, the RealBotix robot allows for example its users to adapt their robots to the properties which they think are appealing like for example."</seg>
<seg id="2401">And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex-robot with pre-programmed personalities as "Frigid Farrah," which gives the impression of obliviality and "Wild Wendy" with an "adventurous" personality. "</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as good as possible," enthuses the website of True. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">During the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, fixed on conversation or she can" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects in this rise of sex robotics - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subordinate female characteristics, the allusions on rape, if one walks a step on Frigid (being here: resistable) Farrah is going to be one most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website the spy roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why do men then have no Roxxxy?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetic or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">Their origins and their increasing refinement point on something dark and deeper in our culture towards a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional encore.</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR notice their growing popularity, they still remain provisional on the edge of the consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what peroozes out of the edge-zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live, very instructive."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until giving them the free market there is permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"however, there is a certain overlapping that these highly developed sex robots are threatened in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the white house that has boiled to have women sexually attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most awful aspect of the TV series" The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the Magd ') are not the graphical pictures, the winding bodies and the outstretched eyes but how realistic this vision works. "</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (if also with Pornostar Proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">They want their inheritance to feel human that they are imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots represent no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">You can not separate yourself from your companion or just leave.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or a background history, nothing that hinders on independence or anything that might interfere with the fantasy of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, you are fake slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the contrary: a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million and in the United States of 300,000, causes stomach ults and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually coming to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washingtoner Artenschutzdiscovered that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells to develop a tolerant intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the introductory researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, declared that immuno cells patrol in the gut to make sure that damaging microbes that hide in food not into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are capable of detecting inflammation, are balanced by cells which promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"when the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in a inflamed cause."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"in experiments, it has been determined that a kind of tolerance is promoting immune cell on mice, that carry a specific bacterium in their intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to emulate the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" we have a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance. "</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and an on tryptophan rich diet tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system goes with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the postdoc capacity in Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it turned out that a group of studies such cells had such cells, but another group of the same trunk that had not been accommodated."</seg>
<seg id="2593">They suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, usually live in the gastrointestinal tract. "</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the strainme of the mice were found DNA-sequenades and found six bacterial species found in mice with the immune cells, but without them in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they were lacking a intestinal microbiom, and they did not develop these kinds of immune cells, and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how the bacteria carried out on the immune system, the researchers S.reuteri have grow in a liquid and then overtook small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - on incomplete immune cells, which were isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the intolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component of the liquid was cleansed, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan-metabolism that is known as an idol-3-lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers double the amount of tryptophan in the forage of mice, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptopuses were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">"Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells such as mice, and that most of us L. reuteri to protect our gastrointestinal diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan-secondary products consist of L. reuteri to develop cells in people like mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with anti-inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said:" "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote, as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptopus values can result in the presence of L. reuteri to expand this population.</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen-Report"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen report on the abuse of abuse offrata Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the misused scandal over the Regensburger Domspatzen continues for discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisacher, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "stated after the publication of the Deutsche Presse-Agentur, he acquired by the former Rainsbishop and present Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of St. Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would greatly serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger would be expressed deep about its own subsals or their at that time wrong evaluation of the operations.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"in contrast, the Vatican" "Osservatore Romano" "is criticized that in reporting about violence at the cathedral spatzen with" twofold measure "will be measured."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"regarding the attacks in Regensburg doubt nobody knows that it would have to be prevented" shameful and shameful acts; but the "degree of medial Manipulation," said the "degree of medial Manipulation," the author of Lucetta Scaraffia, historians and a member of the National Biethic Committee. "</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the all-day experience and is preparing the public opinion that for normal", "writes Scaraffia."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you are happy to go to the church and this is unthinkable."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"furthermore, she pointed out that in her youth" bat "have been a very normal pedagogical means" "to be ready with friends as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it's unfair to adopt today's standards for past decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports about the abuse of abuse, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger was often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"completely wrong, author and historian Michael Hesemann, who spoke with Ratzinger the reminder" My brother of Pope "(translated in 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection," says Ezemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he adds the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that issued by the Bistum Regensburg with Enlightenment commissioned Mr. Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s" "with high plausibility" "victims of attacks, 67 dominspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it says to Georg Ratzinger, who was employed from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg:" in summary, therefore, that it was applied by Domkapellmeister R. in many cases forms of physical and psychic violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with a high level of Emotionality, constancy for the students could also be violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other allegations that many victims of R. are estimable and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">In the interview Ezemann explains why the final report on the abuse of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was unloaded in his opinion.</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-Pages report on the" incidents of violence "at the Regensburger Domspatzen" "gives a conflicting picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"for one, many students stand out his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and Perfectant who was handheld to the oil when a domain has had no top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate as his biographer this final report?</seg>
<seg id="2913">Michael Hesemann: if you feel the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back then you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger occurs at all in it.</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just been dedicated to eight sides and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of mediter- or co-knowledge in the terrible cases sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">"also, the acts of violence at the preschool finds itself outside of its sphere of activity."</seg>
<seg id="2916">You can see him at best to know of it too late or have taken the first hint not seriously enough.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the domicile vening school, on which he worked, was perceived by practically all the respondents as" "Lord", "" "Heaven" "and" "better world." ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also exhibits an excellent testimony," "sincerely", "" honest, "" competent "and" understandably, "the guys regularly enriched with cakes, biscuits and bbons and always encamped by grapes of children."</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complained about its perfectionist and its high emotional originality, which also resulted in Wutaussian."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he did not only crack with chairs and threw the key bund on the ground, but also earthy guys in the hair or ears, he has already existed for years ago, deeply deplated and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his honor of honour, however, must be said that such education methods have been widely used in the questionable period, the 1960s and 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding-methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each of us who was born in 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what is actually happening in this report, namely the irreplaceable sexual abuse and the acts of violence at the preschool, they are certainly dredging of dredging."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders if it is not to do with his profile, and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"at the Bavarian Pope, many who have never understood him, still are doing diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report drafted Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the report was very much reported on the subject of abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger in the final report also given any involvement or co-knowledge in regard to sexual abuse on the load?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: very clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have become familiar to the carapmaster craftsman.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I have never dared to talk with my father or my mother about it," "said a dutiled substitute for the others," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real issue in educating sexual abuse, and is, however, that most victims are not silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if she didn't even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen student Ratzinger's role in regard to the abuse of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: an unquestionably student formulated it so: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have been able (Georg Ratzinger) and could have had the respective perpetrators.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd, to accept that after him... Buben pushy or more clear or even more likely to have opened as compared to their parents, dormitory managers, confidence instructors etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one speaks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"thus the report comes to the very clear result:" "that the students involved in advance and / or their environment were entrusted with the investigation, could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"regarding what sexual abuse is concerned, Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from any fellow-knowing."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"thus, he cannot be accused of having prevented him or put it on display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, there was a lot of" "violence" "with the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger was presented in the report "</seg>
<seg id="2947">Must he live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that in reporting everything is mixed and mixed up to a huge melange from sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is precisely the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is clean separated: between the preschool and the gymnasium of the cathedral, between sexual abuse and violence, as well as, we say once, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"the report also deals with incidents from the period since 1945, thus also from four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral conductors."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible testing pedagogy, the cases in which lad of legendary teachers were clumsy and malignated and are all unzipped, uneventful at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous states have to prevail."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with them, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he got the boys first to face, when they were already on the scraping school."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on what was, like most witnesses emphasize, the subject" "preschool" "tabu."</seg>
<seg id="2955">It was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "heavenly" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different from the scraping school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">Michael Hesemann: there has been discipline though but is not a savicious force.</seg>
<seg id="2958">"and this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report comes to the conclusion that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R., and therefore in numerous cases, despite violence even positive memories with it. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"thus, at the most still the accusation to have seen."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report was able to define only two periods where it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he began to establish itself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (as the witness) did not want to hear, and then again at 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Only Georg Ratzinger consistently the ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Fabric Gymnasium, who even reproduced the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he pointed out that," "that in the pre-school, he will continue to be practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"already in view of the danger of negative press-media, he recommended urgent opening."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when the legal clarity was, when he was recently banned in Bavaria too."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they unsettled in a legal gray area, as each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate correctly where the persons involved were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible border was exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but one can also not say, he always had looked at."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">Only in 1980 the inspectors at schools were officially abolished in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis did well, it's unfair to apply the current educational standards to the time period."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we have been talking of" "pitfalls of anachronism," thus the danger of the past to present moral standards. "</seg>
<seg id="2975">Then the princess has already been right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but of course this does not apply to sexual abuse, who was despicable at all times and also not for what was broken in the preschool of resistance and violence to innocent children's education, that goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all quite horrible and I am glad that it is finally working.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishment, so ear-coves and in the hair and ears to pull, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, it was then strictly forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what image of his Regensburger is represented by George Ratzinger because in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the topic come to language too?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, so Pope Benedikts XVI., tells about his perspective, that the Domspatzen played just a secondary role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not believe that there was a stricter rule there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even that must be said: without this perfectionist, without the demand of unconditionned discipline, it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world trants, true cultural message of Europe and his musical tradition, which went straight to the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and bonanza alone, one does not make a big singer and stand before every success, regardless of what territory, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger with the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and in addition I met Georg Ratzinger really well and again and again as wonderful, humorous, fundamental, deeply believers and heartfelt people from which one could not imagine that he could just do something to do something."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get along with how many former Domspatzen still keep in contact with him today, 23 years after his empowerment, please visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strict with them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought to them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovely disrespect, to which they still look at it and to honor them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clear: all that you preejects, are guardians methods that were then on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man, just because he has prominently and has an even more prominent brother to make the medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the nasty intention, which is behind it all too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which was just published, relayed him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now, the standing area, a 93-year-old man, who has acquired great service to his merits, and perhaps even Germany no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen to finally leave peace."</seg>
