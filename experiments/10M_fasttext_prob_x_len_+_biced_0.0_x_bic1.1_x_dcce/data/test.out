Jennifer An@@ iston : I will always put in drawers
Jennifer An@@ iston must not always be perfect or successful .
this is why the Hollywood star in an interview is now un@@ ambiguous .
&quot; I will always put in drawers or dra@@ wed from outside label , who mostly have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I myself don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are more likely to sn@@ ore . &quot;
Jennifer An@@ iston ( 47 ) can only laugh that it is regarded as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current &quot; Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress spends her time at home , pre@@ m TV with lo@@ cker@@ em D@@ utt and Mexican food , it is in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; for the white gl@@ ut , they bring the question according to the child &apos;s desire : &quot; we women must not be married or children have to be totally &quot; , &quot; thus the Hollywood star . &quot;

the film works with us from 25 August .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ age@@ able .
&quot; at the end of a golf player in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger was looking for a little variation with a horseback ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a first .
CH@@ IO : &quot; Golden Se@@ pyram@@ ide &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses rec@@ alled on their fes@@ tivities , they came home to the for@@ age in a fast g@@ allo@@ p . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and then the equ@@ est@@ rian accordion ended up again .
on Saturday Germany was the best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament tournaments - close to horses .
&quot; he let him run with his family through the plant of the AL@@ RV , on a horse , he didn &apos;t even look for photo purposes . &quot;
the first time in Aachen and thus also at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports help ran@@ ged the man from An@@ hausen into the framework of a small gala .
on awards it lacks the like@@ able athle@@ te .
&quot; Bundes@@ la@@ in@@ kreu@@ z , sil@@ ber@@ nes Lor@@ be@@ er@@ blatt , Champions Tour of the Year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already dressed him .
the 18th winner of the sport pyramid .
in Aachen he met the first prize of Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday .
&quot; this award means very much , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; &quot; for it is not only awarded for spor@@ tive successes but also for social involvement . &quot;
for decades long @-@ term has been promoting the offspring .
and so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro to the same .
&quot; with 15 other outstanding sports@@ men , the two @-@ time U.S. mast is awarded on Saturday to the &quot; Hall of Fame of German Sports . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the scenes are the Lei@@ ch@@ ta@@ op@@ ten Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Sch@@ mit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard , the daughter Corn@@ elia Han@@ be , the Ru@@ ach@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the leader of the leader of Saint James Wi@@ en@@ e@@ eh@@ le , and pos@@ th@@ um the Hand@@ b@@ aller Erhard . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men were on Saturday to Aachen .
&quot; after the official part , the illustr@@ ative society went into the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ az@@ za Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger held far to the big animals .
Clin@@ ics and tr@@ umps policies in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement T@@ TP - this is both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential attacks are in the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and Hill@@ ary Clinton is a prin@@ cipl@@ ed , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
the role of the state .
Tr@@ ump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations .
&quot; Clinton wants to ste@@ er the economy to death , and to regulate his death , he says . &quot;
&quot; himself , on the other hand , would be quite different . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely withdraw regulations , and it is strong for far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax practices - for individuals and businesses . &quot;
&quot; Clinton says : the state has certain tasks to perform , it has disadvantages opportunities to open up and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the taxes would increase to the rich , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to be invested , Tr@@ ump and Clinton have almost wor@@ ded . &quot;
the democratic candidate in announ@@ cing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly refused by the state @-@ critical tea wings of the Republi@@ can .
&quot; in Tr@@ ump , we might have even more party discussions . &quot;
more evident are the differences in energy and climate policies .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and extend the coal mining in the USA again .
oil @-@ mining should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris mi@@ tigation agreement .
&quot; in contrast , Clinton wants to expand and expand the renewable energies with their investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will create the super@@ power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; however , not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ acific trade agreement , do both want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both however , want to isolate the US not from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; these are to be paid better then , for instance Clinton calls for some Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of 7.@@ 25 US dollars is a hunger strike .
it wants to raise it up to $ 15 per hour .
&quot; what tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must r@@ enter , then he says he should not be altered . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policies of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand stands Tr@@ ump , which wants to rel@@ ieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics follow him , so that the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least demand from the rich , that they pay more taxes , and their critics say , more taxes are also not the solution . &quot;
escape : &quot; every sli@@ pped woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence is for women who flee alone , almost for everyday life . &quot;
when they arrive in Germany they are often traumati@@ zed .
a house offers a refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
&quot; each one has a baby , the most up one year old . &quot;
one has put her small son in his arm .
he was curious with big eyes curious in the room .
his mother moved to the table top .
until they notice that it is observed .
she sm@@ iled short and kis@@ sed the little ones .
the scene appears normal .
until you talk to Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; it is the business leader of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the subject of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are frozen .
they live in the Munich &apos;s north in one of the few de@@ centr@@ alised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria .
in January Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the establishment along with Pro Famili@@ a and the Mün@@ chner women &apos;s aid .
it has been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men do not exist - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here , has made experiences with sexual violence on their escape . &quot;
&quot; men flee for war because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death , or because their families want them to send them as hop@@ pers to Europe . &quot;
&quot; in women , there are other reasons for escape : &quot; many ste@@ al secretly with them because they no longer see another way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marriages , honorary mur@@ ders , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this continues it .
on the run goes on .
&quot; that tu@@ gs are calling for a bottle of water a sexual act , is not uncommon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believe that the end , as soon as they anchor in Germany , ir@@ re , tells us . &quot;
&quot; again , the women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodations in the Munich &apos;s north , appreci@@ ates them . &quot;
some of the children are certainly not optional .
many women were so accustomed to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; since they are often not going to help , there are more accommodations just for them . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; the question of whether it is of a similar project like Munich in its jurisdiction , answer some with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Ober@@ pf@@ alz and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of the governments . &quot;
&quot; in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , women are not found separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press secretary of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Unter@@ - and Mittel@@ fran@@ ken there are in some communal spaces or their own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Nieder@@ bay@@ ern , there are two central accommodation exclusively for women . &quot;
the committee &quot; rights of women and gender equality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men .
&quot; in a study which was published for the committee , it is said : &quot; it is very important that men and women are separated . &quot;
&quot; if the privacy or women and women stay together , there may be - continued - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women , stands in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women of this basic need is felt , one may be charged on the cr@@ ush that there is at the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since itself has been talking about it , we have a long queue , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistants in general : demands for new working struggles
the members of the assistant have called their union to be a new labor force in their disputes concerning a new contract .
&quot; the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council , from the beginning of September more work @-@ actions . &quot;
the J@@ DC said that the Ministers had failed to respond to the concerns relating to the contract .
assistance and medical students agreed in July on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A .
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was released on Twitter on Thursday night , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would insist that the treaty was refused . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In view of this , the J@@ DC was voted to reject the proposed new contract completely and was demanding official new negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today made a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to complete a run program of escal@@ ating work measures that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the dispute resulted in the investig@@ ators of this year 1960 , the first general incidents in the history of N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A Assist@@ enz@@ oll@@ arians Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana came after the election of the agreed terms of contract agreed by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions that occurred still before the vote of 5@@ 4,000 assistance agents and medical students , with that the contract should be beneficial and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Minister Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be compulsory in a short term . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands , and to pro@@ claim an official end to the eight months of long @-@ term war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the gol@@ d@@ ild@@ ed hall of St. Petersburg &apos;s palace in reception , I cannot defend myself that Ankara wants this reconciliation most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but pl@@ unge in the sm@@ iles was a mal@@ ign@@ ant and barely radi@@ ant heat , even for its back @-@ lasting conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times . &quot;
I could no longer count .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but can even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day described a newspaper that Erdo@@ gan was so ben@@ ding , as if never had something worst . &quot;
I seemed to indicate the opposite rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ant , sustainable cooling showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes : the de@@ preci@@ ation of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was sore .
Putin shared and accused Ankara to put Russia in his back .
the failure was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend .
&quot; to rebuild the c@@ ousin , it becomes difficult if not even impossible . &quot;
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the stat@@ ely controlled media led a fierce , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at one time , it seemed that the Turks would blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations of leading officials , that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria had benefited from the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message , that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting occurred only because Putin has received ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , who he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire lie clearly on the hand . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed state dispute .
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the charter of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has decreased by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
you are counting on a late seasonal ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean .
&quot; this week projected the state remote , fruit and vegetables , once the Turkish agr@@ arian imported again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti makes it simple : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is angry in the West since its response to the tried to take power is considered a weak answer .
&quot; in addition , the continued Gro@@ ll come across the snow @-@ emp@@ o of the EU &apos;s accession negotiations and Putin - the pi@@ er@@ pi@@ ke is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian President he won surely a bonus that he tried to seek support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is well @-@ known for Moscow , a matter of course , which itself has a deep fear of rain . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey , one as described in me a analy@@ st once described , &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; : two countries that are ch@@ ased from the West and poorly treated and are now emerging . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference in Syria , where Moscow recently gave the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey can support antagon@@ istic sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial discussions both president appeared at the press conference , they had not even stri@@ ped the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey inten@@ tioned it to answer a question about their differences , while Putin decided to stress this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common den@@ omin@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ tilities - and in the light of the potential for a complete dis@@ aster , as NATO @-@ member Turkey was abol@@ ishing the Russian battle , it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
the R@@ BS brand will be reduced to a back@@ office role according to the leader of the Bank .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland with that the R@@ BS brand associated with the global ambitions of the bank .
the Bank has since dist@@ anced itself since it was almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago .
&quot; in this period you have used br@@ anding &quot; &quot; R@@ BS &quot; &quot; to protect other end consumers . &quot;
she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to the Wimbledon winner Andy Mur@@ ray .
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
the Royal Bank of Scotland will be available only for customers in Scotland but will not be initi@@ alized .
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the de@@ centralized headquarters and the stock exchange at Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
Ul@@ ster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for the retail store that will be given more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the RS@@ B brand will become our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand , among which our employees will be busy as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now , I say that we do not pursue global objectives , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his Sport @-@ sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands , as we concentrate on inside ( we asked ) to make this a better Bank for customers ? &quot; said the chief executive . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can take these brands again , so I think that the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th prize in New@@ market
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spr@@ ing@@ ed champagne after a double room at New@@ market , which brings him 3.@@ 000@@ th prize . &quot;
the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori began Friday his 3.@@ 000@@ th British gain on New@@ market .
&quot; he sat on Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local track , with his second win of the night a milestone . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italians is the sixth ho@@ ckey , who reaches milestone in the flat @-@ race race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , Pat Ed@@ dry and Willi@@ e Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the dre@@ im@@ ali@@ ge winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won earlier to G@@ hay@@ yar , said : &quot; it is something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too .
&quot; I am very happy that it is going to happen at New@@ market , because I am here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it is not a big meeting ; it is not Royal As@@ cot - it is a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori increases the che@@ er when he takes the victory to Pre@@ di@@ le@@ ction
&quot; two Jo@@ ck@@ eys have reached the milestone in the obstacles race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a recru@@ iting career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career progression . &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of the modern age and it is not a surprise that he has reached this milestone just a few from him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect that distinguishes it from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma loved fans for many years now . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie from some weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already fet@@ ched more 6,000 wins if he was not just a weekend and big tur@@ no@@ jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has introduced a winner in the UK for nearly 30 years .
&quot; he has a vibrant personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Fl@@ ying Dis@@ mount
from Fl@@ ying Fin@@ ishes to Fl@@ ying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the fig@@ ure@@ head of the British fla@@ x for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 in As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a drug ban . &quot;
&quot; three years ago he had difficulty in the beginning , when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to de@@ fy his doubts , and to return to his existence . &quot;
and he is not at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori was told earlier that he wants to continue with competitions up to his at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin hum@@ ert Staff leader Sergei Ivan@@ ov
the Russian President Vladimir Putin has released un@@ expect@@ edly his chief executive officer Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
Ivan@@ ov was many years part of the closest associate price by Putin .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed as a special representative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , it is that Putin has arranged the dis@@ miss@@ al of Ivan@@ ov by his duties as Chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration . &quot;
Anton V@@ ain@@ o who was Deputy Chairman since 2012 was appointed successor to his successor .
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in the Est@@ onian capital Tallinn , he made his gradu@@ ation at the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the embassy in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; on the web site of the Krem@@ lin , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was a protocol director and deputy director of the government . &quot;
&quot; he said to Putin , &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of President in regard to legislative acts and checks for the implementation of your instructions . &quot;
Putin shared the Russian TV stations on Friday with Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and have recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was a long time in one of the closest conspir@@ ators of Vladimir Putin , and as he works for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
as a rod he was one of the most powerful men of the country .
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , who was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Staff returned to his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the sm@@ iles to the cameras , here are only a few of them convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
&quot; thus , is the consequence of a kind of power @-@ struggle ? &quot;
this is what nobody knows .
&quot; but the official claim - that a man who once was pri@@ ze@@ able as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - b@@ umped on great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , who quoted on the website of the Krem@@ lin , &quot; Ivan@@ ov &quot; it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - describe the job for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
Ivan@@ ov took the post in December 2011 .
before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister .
&quot; he is a member of the Russian Security Council , and as Putin , former member of the State Security Council , K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council ( FS@@ B ) , who was appointed K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin was bored of his power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted . &quot;
once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could be president of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term as a third term coup against the Constitution .
&quot; but this item was taken by another , close allies of Putin , Dmit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he resum@@ ed the president three and a half years later .
&quot; Criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son , after he hit the producer &quot;
Gib@@ son participated last month at a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios used to produce the series in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron hot@@ chner , ap@@ olog@@ ised on Thursday before the announcement of his cancellation . &quot;
&quot; on the set , it came to artistic differences and dis@@ agreement . &quot;

Queens@@ bor@@ row Cros@@ sing : bridge now connected to Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the Nord@@ deck of the Queens@@ bridge Cros@@ sings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four des@@ ks of the &quot; cover @-@ blo@@ wer &quot; , &quot; which is completion in order to approach each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 ton .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete as well as 46 Sch@@ rä@@ g@@ rop@@ es . &quot;
the £ 1,@@ 35 billion expensive project should be completed by May 2017 . &quot;
&quot; economic Minister Keit@@ h Brown and the construction site had a visit today , and was one of the first to went on the bridge from the country to the bridge . &quot;
he said : &quot; this is a historic and symbolic moment in the construction of the Eco Cros@@ sings .
we are all witnesses of an engineering of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30.000 tonnes of concrete and steel which were used alone for this part of the bridge .
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the closure between the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the Brü@@ cken@@ deck is a delicate activity , which require extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; in total , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is placed in their place and the last section of Dec@@ ks gets a Bet@@ ong@@ uss for the Deck , which means that the whole Deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge to its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , project leader of For@@ th Cros@@ sing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; &quot; the first circuit is a major milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
this fantastic project presents the closure of future @-@ orient@@ ated high@@ - and low @-@ construction .
&quot; after the installation of the last street section and its connection with the north tower building , we had to then close the existing gap on the north or south side . &quot;
this was reached by dra@@ gging the northern fe@@ eder bridge 700 milli@@ metres south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , as the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct 2@@ 22 metres long is , about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled up with a slope of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; un@@ married , because the toler@@ ances that the team works , are tiny - on each page they carried only a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck &quot; &quot; to be alive after they were thrown by their fishing boat from Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI life@@ guard took place on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had trouble swim in security while moving their boat from their own strength .
&quot; we saw how the boat turned around and turned to us the worst before , &quot; said the head of the li@@ f@@ ebo@@ at station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already shipped the boat except their reach until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fisher@@ y , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found at a cru@@ x without life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all arrived on board the cruise ship and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr. Jones said , &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have fortunately un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat @-@ motor had a p@@ stop@@ over , however this sol@@ dered with the k@@ de@@ ans of the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has wondered about these men today .
hard hurt - man sti@@ el on his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and hard to hurt .
&quot; as the police did yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
instead of cut the alco@@ hol@@ ism with the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend .
&quot; when this came into the apartment , he went twice to her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and by the body .
the police could not take the perpetrators .
&quot; during the 50 @-@ year @-@ old the clothes of his ex @-@ friend destroyed his mother , he called his mother . &quot;
this alar@@ ming level of whose sister .
&quot; together with their partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm down its brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the street it met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
&quot; when the two women met the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschwei@@ gs cheap apartments ?
&quot; &quot; &quot; the SPD and Green of my : investors should in future be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how does one react to the bad news that Braunschwei@@ g will lose almost 1300 cheap apartments in the next few years ?
the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; action concept &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
&quot; first and foremost , it is about the question : who is supposed to build the affordable housing ? &quot;
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; SPD Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann says : &quot; &quot; we are united with the Greens : who wants to build on urban areas , will be spending 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also occur in stock . &quot;
&quot; but the great issue in the town hall is , however , as viol@@ a : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private areas ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to be at least 10 percent to investors , but as possible as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new municipal housing programme , which will cost millions of costs and must be financed for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the Left wants even more hardness conditions for investors .
&quot; regardless of its , as Brat@@ mann , a ti@@ ghtening of the situation on the apartment market . &quot;
&quot; if the scope of action is implemented , it will provide for additional tasks in the construction administration . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the specialists .
&quot; the program is not entirely clear : because the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
how does one monitor the loss of some 1300 cheap apartments whose support will be run over the next few years ?
it will be 500 apartments alone until 2020 .
&quot; to prevent this , as the plann@@ er Spe@@ aker in Nicole Palm , should now be bought out @-@ out links from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we would have to be thought to take homes again in the future . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
in one fell s@@ woo@@ p the problem might be solved .
because in the west town the end of the year is running out .
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get back in the discounts for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : we do not want the owners , the apartment companies . &quot;
&quot; for the number of social housing in the Western city is dramatically increasing , you are removed from the goal of so @-@ called diar@@ rhe@@ a . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a concentration of social @-@ minded in just a few districts should not give it any more . &quot;
the Greens anticipate that there will be no movement in the discussion .
&quot; President Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke says : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go to the boat . &quot;
this is concentrated on more construction sites for family homes .
but what does not mean that no compromise can be found yet .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that is worthwhile &quot;
it &apos;s fascinating to watch how the world changes .
&quot; that teenagers and children can no longer go outside but rather prefer to spend their leisure time on screens , on screens , has been compl@@ ained by many people over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ em@@ on Go is about getting people from the sofa and become more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to TV , then to video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course , I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that has been created on the characters , first created for the video games in the 1990s ( later this resulted from a cartoon series , play@@ cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; as many phenomena of the population culture decreased the interest in the launch of the game in the US , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the launch of the market in other countries was moved by massive demand that the server over@@ threw .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go more users as Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , the players go out with their smartphone outside and look for Pok@@ é@@ mons who are tr@@ acked with a GPS and once they were found , &quot; &quot; photographed &quot; &quot; ( via a scre@@ enshot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was still younger , joined the W@@ ahn and sprang out for the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; &quot; average &quot; &quot; person every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ o@@ gram , an app for Apple Watch , followed 3@@ 5.000 users , distributed the Washington Post recently , that within two days following the launch of the game , the number of people followed every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent j@@ umped . &quot;
the company doesn &apos;t know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campa@@ igning to health , people want to bring about 30 minutes to take &quot; &quot; from the sofa &quot; &quot; and to be active every day , because many public messages are boring to health and come from people who look great . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport can not be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sport , reduces its chances to suffer from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that too long is to lead them here . &quot;
&quot; but the wonder@@ full at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outside , that fun is fun . &quot;
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine , as well as fun . &quot;
some people close even new friend@@ ships in hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also m@@ illing play@@ through , who must always complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should it be ?
it has been a breakthrough .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ Bit could already follow our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to practice sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its charm and the use will be after time .
&quot; however , because of poker success there will be more games to combine the apps and virtual reality with the activ@@ ator in the real world and help many people on the hunt , more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the dam
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is all the im@@ mu@@ n .
dynam@@ ically on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beams .
stunning on the floor .
on a whole line brilliant .
and now finally at the Olympi@@ asi@@ an .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old Tur@@ ymn@@ ast g@@ ymn@@ ast on Thursday for the multi @-@ struggle title and enlarged the gap between themselves and the rest of the world from all eyes under the spotlight @-@ light of the Olympic Games .
&quot; your total result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly in front of the silver med@@ all@@ ists and &quot; &quot; Final Five &quot; &quot; team amer@@ ic@@ in A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian Bronze Age , Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American sisters of Simone Bil@@ es made on the Swedish bal@@ ancing during the next multi @-@ struggle for women at the Olympic Summer Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; this is the fourth hetero@@ sexual woman who wins a multi @-@ struggle title , and the fifth , while it solidi@@ fies its reputation , the best of their generation or even at all . &quot;
she broke out in tears than her final result had been shown and her long journey at this moment found an end .
this success puts them in the same League as unique athletes such as Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; the last three years have dominated their sport , 15 world medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises , that the Olympi@@ asi@@ an from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u retri@@ ton from her said that she is &quot; the best g@@ ymn@@ ast that I have ever seen . &quot;
&quot; they expected a last test in Brazil , a competition which went not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a burden of superior expectations . &quot;
&quot; not with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas back , would be considered as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American , Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace it after gold and silver in the single majority of women at the Paris Olympic Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday , have won &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal at Tuesday , while at the departure party of the retired man @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ ol@@ yi was used as a label . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es ins@@ isted on the top , never planned to have the future planned , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which included their typical tumor pass - is matched to Latin American music which would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not a coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grandparents as a small child and was adopted by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans mother during a school@@ ing in the g@@ ymnasium , was trained in the Bo@@ or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no extra @-@ round competition , a stra@@ ined series , which will stop as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Must@@ af@@ ina has made easy through two la@@ vers , the picture closes . &quot;
bri@@ ck@@ bal@@ ancing and bu@@ o@@ dent@@ ures - in which they hold the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she came again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the pig @-@ beam again - and continued with a 15.@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor yet another . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embr@@ aced them gently as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ ary - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow on Bil@@ es shiny red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in their collective book . &quot;
&quot; the achievement of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought the third place , but the bronze medals in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke on Must@@ af@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old teams had been named &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after her re@@ practise , she threw out to the audience of Kus@@ sh@@ es , overwhelmed by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as it is concerned , the rapidly expanded T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ old will have a completely new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in the car in the car
&quot; according to police report that were published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year old girl have been killed in one of the deadly attacks since a decade in the first series of series of Phoenix while they were under the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Lin@@ er , Stef@@ anie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah was shot on June 12th , while the car was parked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a g@@ ist weapon , while he was on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle , is read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police shared that the triple murder seems to have been the result of a rob@@ bery @-@ car@@ ess , as the Att@@ acker didn &apos;t take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the Poli@@ ze@@ is@@ pre@@ cher from Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the g@@ imm@@ ick led the investig@@ ator , a closer look at it , whether it is connected with four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; all in all , predominantly in Hisp@@ anic dwell@@ ings within four months were killed in nine attacks , seven people were killed and two others injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , shared Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , an affiliate of C@@ BS , beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects has used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincoln . &quot;
&quot; the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they have led to the conclusion that the attacks are linked , and committed by the same mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Ellis , 33 , was hosp@@ it@@ alized because of its wounds and died later . &quot;
&quot; Lin@@ er , 31 , and Ellis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness shared by the police that it was not uncommon for them to sit in a parked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which turned on an empty pick@@ up truck a half hour before the triple &quot; &quot; murder and turned out , that it was the work of the serial &quot;
&quot; investig@@ ators found pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen , and secured a bul@@ let from the seat as well as ball @-@ frag@@ mente from the engine . &quot;
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to the s@@ ingen , toys , and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the least of its Alter@@ ed Ed@@ mund Micro@@ cephal@@ ia , the result of a genetic disorder , over which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home for the first time was my first thought , I didn &apos;t create it . &quot;
I do not create that .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not true -- naturally one has left it , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; your husband Vincent and you have been told that Ed@@ mund is never able to recognize them under circumstances , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer to it was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; stated Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can run with the help of a wal@@ ker .
Ed@@ mund was neither sitting nor cra@@ wl to his third year and he can still not speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
he can run and cycle with support .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
&quot; Elizabeth shows the drawing language , which is Ed@@ mund for &quot; &quot; Please sing me something out &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bring him a language in , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical string - she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some characters alone .
micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infection with viruses such as mas@@ h or the coron@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus dict@@ ated .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to remembers the emotional price of a certain future .
&quot; I asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what is going to happen ?
and she still does not really know .
&quot; I have not asked for a long time after the prognosis , because I didn &apos;t expect that someone can really say to me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hope@@ ful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects that were caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will become better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; intense rainf@@ alls , floods gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Mississippi &quot;
violent rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floods in Lou@@ isi@@ ana cle@@ ave the Gover@@ nor on Friday the not@@ ch . it is calculated the whole Saturday with more rainf@@ all .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the pp@@ is flooded its banks , and threatened with large @-@ scale floods in extreme rainf@@ all , reported the National weather service . &quot;
&quot; the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John Bel Edwards shared , that state officials stand in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the churches concerned . &quot;
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ person for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Govern@@ ors , shared with that the requests for high @-@ water vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags are multiple . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that alone the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a floo@@ d@@ war@@ ner system will be used across wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service left sil@@ ently that in this area could fall additional 3 to 5 inches to rain .
&quot; in the south of Alab@@ ama , a Fl@@ ut@@ early @-@ system was used on Friday , while in the area of Mobile continued to rain . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ im Springs , which are both in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , are all likely to reach the weekend of record . &quot;
the Me@@ ter@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can wash many houses in the near @-@ location close to Bat@@ on Rouge .
&quot; he also said that a stream@@ lined floods in Ascension are a danger , as these are slowly flowing down through the be@@ aten rivers , slowly in the Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Mississippi border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached on Friday already at 09.@@ 00 the highest state ever recorded . &quot;
rescue team continues to sli@@ pped people out of the floo@@ ding water in the bor@@ dering Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the South@@ west of Mississippi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his boots were among those who were res@@ cu@@ ed on Friday in the vicinity of Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is usually more than 400 feet away from his house , went to climb over night . &quot;
&quot; he said that another step of boots , who lives nearby , could have warned . &quot;
&quot; we are awakened and the water flowing and flowing in , &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my wa@@ ist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that she lived there in the 48 years , where she had never seen such a high tower of the river . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members could have all the disabled , and he was the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a great military truck and they had brought them to the next fire guard in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding &quot; had spread quickly , since there was still heavy rainf@@ alls and that the authorities take Ev@@ ac@@ uation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground has been fully operational by the rainf@@ alls on Wednesday .
&quot; the authorities admit that severe rainf@@ alls and street inv@@ ul@@ ts the rescue of inhabitants from their houses in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a Par@@ ish and pedago@@ gies , in five schools . &quot;
the C@@ BS @-@ subsidiary EM@@ L reported that an ordered rate in Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a 200 flooded houses .
the inhabitants were ev@@ acu@@ ated in two churches which are now both in@@ und@@ ated .
&quot; the ruler of the municipality of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities would have saved 72 people and seven pets , which were stra@@ ined by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , Not@@ ice were appointed to accomo@@ date the ev@@ ac@@ uation . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts back , they will return to their homes again , &quot; he said . &quot;
in the city of Ham@@ mond the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ pa@@ ho@@ a have been closed almost two d@@ utz@@ ing streets due to the flood and sand@@ bags for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and stores .
&quot; the last great floo@@ ding that we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ ay Land@@ rum from the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in the pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Harrison Coun@@ t@@ ys said it ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his information a handful of houses are supposed to be reported on Thursday as flooded , but on Friday we were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keit@@ h Town@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said Town@@ son , &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; run by balls , &quot; survi@@ ves in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police share that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week was already the second time that a 6 @-@ year child was shot . &quot;
the grandparents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; the grandparents gave me that Brown suffered several bul@@ b injuries , including in the spra@@ ying , leg , arm and belly , but that he was in his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was carried out by bul@@ lets , shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ endemic to the transmitter . &quot;
I can simply not believe it .
the condition of the boy was classified as critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the family of the boy shared the sender that he is likely to recover .
he could have started the first class in a local school .
Brown was one of four people shot in German@@ town .
also three men were shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year men is in critical state ; the other two victims are according to C@@ BS Philadelphia in stable state .
&quot; the boy was shot at the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , which is located in a critical state , reported on the transmitter . &quot;
&quot; the other two victims were not found in the car , and the police were determined whether under one of the injured men of the perpetr@@ ator . &quot;
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a cross @-@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
&quot; Pat@@ ron@@ enh@@ ül@@ sen for Stur@@ mo@@ ve@@ ge@@ on , which were re@@ trac@@ ted at different stub@@ bor@@ ns , s@@ wir@@ es the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly a prolonged struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the pav@@ ement , were sle@@ eves . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to have been several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; divided police officers Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di the police in Philadelphia to the sender . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles met in the area .
there was no fixed and the police are currently watching the monitoring video .
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a Qu@@ ag@@ ger on the arm when she played in front of her house in the neighborhood of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police is still looking for a susp@@ ects .
&quot; why we Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie needs &quot;
that &apos;s what I present to myself under the Women &apos;s olymp@@ ic team and that is more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been around since 1984 at every summer olymp@@ ic and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly , this team has three turbines , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren , Lau@@ rie &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspir@@ es for many young girls from other skin colour . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jü@@ din , and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ lics is , round out , makes every proud . &quot;
this team is finally reflected in the United States .
it has solidi@@ fies the black and h@@ isp@@ anic female presence at the top of this sport .
in the last four years the number one was one under the female Tur@@ ner@@ o an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American leader .
last year Simone and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
at the last Olympic Games Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprising olymp@@ ic award and America che@@ ered .
&quot; now , the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez as she was unexpected , but master@@ ful G@@ ym@@ as@@ tical routine suppliers . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Simone was the fourth , hetero@@ sexual American woman , who won gold at an individual campa@@ igning event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are witn@@ essing the tip of this sport , but we do not see turn@@ around in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison , to create it to the Olympic Team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five , &quot; because the next Olympi@@ ad will only have four tur@@ ers in the crew . besides , this is the last year with Marta Kar@@ ol@@ yi as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks so that Tur@@ ning is a more expensive sport and Tur@@ ner will primarily be maintained in private sports , which can be maintained by parents who pay for training , furniture , travel , travel and hotel costs ( for the coaches and their tur@@ ner and families ) . the list is possible to continue . &quot;
the majority of these turn@@ around are in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
in these associations the Tur@@ ner will receive their overall training and this is a expensive and long @-@ term commitment .
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Train@@ ers from Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer from Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both have trained their athletes since they started with the tower . &quot;
&quot; we must get inspired by the con@@ gregations of countless , young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a performance and an easier to drive turn@@ out . &quot;
I have founded my turn@@ out of 20 years .
&quot; for my events , we have offered free and affordable turtles in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and h@@ isp@@ anic ) and trained national and international vic@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hometown ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality tur@@ n@@ ines , which make the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic athle@@ tic type . &quot;
&quot; design develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this squ@@ ad , that bring thousands of young girls to interest to the tower and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
it is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by the Hol@@ en of the olymp@@ ic team and thank you , F@@ ass her so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to start healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistants would like to organise further strikes after they rejected Jer@@ emy Hun@@ ts proposal
&quot; the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes caused by the acceptance of a re@@ formed contract with the function@@ aries of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7@@ ,000 assistance diseases , declined in a choice , refused him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t has revealed plans to introduce the contract in forced , and said that the N@@ HS was committed to a &quot; &quot; no country &quot; , &quot; and any further delay in the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistant should receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend work , to improve care of the maintenance times . &quot;
&quot; DR Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A Com@@ co committee for assistance consul@@ ted last night in a communication with : &quot; assistants have concluded a serious concern , in particular that it will stimulate the current staff crisis and admin@@ s it to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; only eight weeks left until the first group of doctors will fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time goes out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to solve any dispute through conversations with the government will take part in reluc@@ tance and sometimes remain on a de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was the last month that Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t had made the last month , that his door was always ready to stop . &quot;
Jer@@ emy Hun@@ t has to act now to lift up the pre@@ condition and to address the worries of the assistance .
&quot; if he did not do this , so the assistance agents have made it clear that they are ready to perform further work amp@@ ant actions . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a re@@ plen@@ ishment of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 schedules , because nur@@ ses and specialists have been included to grant doctors on the strip @-@ post@@ p@@ ation . &quot;
the ministers had hoped to end the dispute over changes through an acceptance of the Re@@ formed contract with the Func@@ tion@@ aries of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to have a better week@@ day compensation for the 5@@ 4,000 assistance agents , which will be subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director of the N@@ HS employees , demanded the assistance to end the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; working amp@@ ant measures do not reach anything of the only little , but have already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patient , nursing staff and their families just worries , hard@@ ship and interruption . &quot;
&quot; over the last two months , we spoke to the Com@@ bin@@ aries of the assistants and with the Ministry of Health and other ministries positive to the concerns about the tut@@ el@@ age and wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility for training , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training , mutual recognition of the curriculum with BM@@ A in November , February and May have been . &quot;
the £ 2 per day - medication that can reduce heart attack
thousands of heart disease patients will benefit from a £ 2 per day drug since the authorities are advised to admin@@ ister this more people for a longer time period .
the sm@@ oul@@ dering drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeti@@ tive heart attack for people with a her@@ ary disease .
&quot; the drug is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of a stroke , or a further heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years of intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS Reg@@ ul@@ ators N@@ ICE of the N@@ HS has recommended a four years of intake to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 14@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
coron@@ ary ar@@ ctic and stro@@ kes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the arteries , the har@@ ass@@ ures form . &quot;
&quot; when the t@@ ag breaks apart , it may cause a blood c@@ lot that causes the blood flow to the heart and caused a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ ots sol@@ ves , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g the blood flow to the brain , which causes a stroke . &quot;
individuals who had already had a heart attack , are subject to a higher risk to have another . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ zen@@ eca , and is driven under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft version of N@@ ICE , which was released today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with one twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE health @-@ evaluation centre said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons who suffered a heart attack , have suffered a further heart attack or stroke - often with disastrous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
the experience shows that T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing the heart attack and stroke are people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; through a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend the available treatment options to thousands of people that can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of blood - is limited to a period of up to three years . the application design does not recommend treatment that exceeds that period of time .
culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ en makes electoral standards b@@ lossom in Muslim areas
&quot; the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on , was last year on the release of a government report on corruption from office &quot;
&quot; a culture of Political Cor@@ rec@@ i has led to this , that far @-@ spread constitu@@ ency in Muslim communities is not kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored like a crus@@ hing government report today . &quot;
&quot; the former cabinet @-@ member Sir Eric Pick@@ les acc@@ esses the police , voting and Rath@@ geber for it , evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and communal government , who now is a antagon@@ istic approach , said that the intimi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that it should be permitted by the police , def@@ endant outside of choice of choice to protect voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should carry out a badge with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
currently a vot@@ er must name his name and address .
&quot; the report suggests not removing ink on the finger of a person when they enter their vote , to prevent that anyone chooses twice . &quot;
&quot; wh@@ istle @-@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
it demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of not official commis@@ sions or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against voting fraud , but also the municipal government in front of the wider corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was arranged by the down@@ ing Street as a result of the Tower Ham@@ lets Elec@@ toral and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special Court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ ein Rah@@ man was to be exposed to a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupt and illegal practices of his am@@ tes . &quot;
the court was that Rah@@ man had per@@ ated the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in the Finnish way &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with se@@ gregation and Islam@@ ophobia .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Rah@@ man should &quot; &quot; have led &quot; &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ati@@ ous obligation of Muslims to choose him . &quot;
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person is choosing to be someone else .
Sir Eric said that there were evidence of fraud across the country .
&quot; he expressed particularly alar@@ ming for frau@@ dul@@ ent di@@ aling choice - when older members of the Muslim community would have made pressure on people , a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including filling out the wise to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it means : &quot; as proof was attached that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exer@@ ted , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of elders , especially communities with Pak@@ ist@@ an@@ ean or ban@@ ana background . &quot;
&quot; there were concerns that ... state institutions such as such behaviour had not kno@@ w@@ ingly ignored because of &quot; &quot; political correctly &quot; &quot; sensitivity to Eth@@ nie and Religion . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition , that political activ@@ ist stamp will work out to stop &quot; &quot; re@@ ap &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , requires also tougher registration checks to prevent that the electoral directory is used to im@@ migrant and social protection . &quot;
consideration options to ask voters before choosing after your passport .
&quot; not removing ink on the finger of a person , once she has given her voice to prevent that anyone chooses twice . &quot;
systematic inspections of the nationality of a person to make sure that they are in@@ appropriate .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for automatic stamp @-@ election .
prohibition that political activ@@ ist complete stamp and envel@@ opes of let@@ ter@@ ment are processed .
the police give authority to set up rules to set up freedom of choice .
a legislative change that facilitates an indictment for intimi@@ dation according to the representation of the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s representatives ) in 1983 ) .
photograp@@ hing in franchise .
requirement that only English can be used in the electoral stations ( except for Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that workers tend to enforce their voters alone in the choice of choice .
&quot; Sir Eric is about the Metropolitan Police and it is &quot; astonishing , &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case has not been abandoned . &quot;
&quot; the electoral court has Lut@@ on for Rah@@ man and his deputy on the basis of a L@@ itan@@ ei on corrupted and illegal practices , &quot; said he said . &quot;
&quot; it was sufficiently recognized for a number of reasons , according to the high requirements in criminal proceedings - guilty . &quot;
he also critici@@ zed the most effective &quot; &quot; Ab@@ ha@@ k@@ oder &quot; &quot; of the Rath@@ geber . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the court @-@ part in Tower Ham@@ lets from last year was a warm signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears as the mother of parliament a proud heritage , but the worrying and covered spread of voting and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ double predecessor in and other famous Doppel@@ gänger written by Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ ers in Rio
fans of the Olympi@@ ad 2016 in Rio are held this week about the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ Pre@@ v@@ ot except the edge and the band who has proved impressive doubled pa@@ w of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year Olympics , this summer is by no means the only thing that displays Gold Warri@@ ors Ath@@ let , who has its own famous double ers - at least not when one may believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; hon@@ ouring the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that have spent at the time on our screens , FE@@ MA@@ IL has created a lists at Olympi@@ oni@@ ans that have more than just a certain similarity with hol@@ ly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; other than K@@ ates Double @-@ predecessor in the Rad@@ ren@@ n@@ bahn , many people on the Internet are looking forward to how a certain ar@@ cher can be the Twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Capri@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the team member of the US team in ar@@ chery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a storm on Twitter after images , on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher was given the ins@@ anity in the social media and gave it to hear that he has already heard since his childhood , that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see great similarity , except the facial hair , shared Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I am well as a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular comparisons since London 2012 will undoubtedly emerge more at the center : the recurring similarity between the British vast@@ ly Greg Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
&quot; the Russian Tur@@ it@@ ress Ali@@ ya Must@@ af@@ ina with its large , expres@@ sive eyes is supposed to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an for the Cub@@ an American singer . &quot;
and in the swimming pool the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh for years compared with the G@@ lee Star Matthew Mor@@ rison .
one course higher : this user is the view that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
a further persistent comparison was characterized between the tennis star Rafael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ mann who has similarly heavy eyeb@@ rows and lips .
&quot; the Russian Silver medal in Yu@@ lia E@@ f@@ im@@ ova did more than just the sun@@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ on@@ the hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was attacked by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : foot@@ star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar facial form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others are the similarities too
&quot; theory : according to this user , there is perhaps one reason for the similarity of the pair . &quot;
&quot; a Twitter @-@ U@@ ser@@ in stated their satisfaction that &quot; &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter nearly identical . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the U.S. football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress Jennifer Car@@ p@@ enter an incredibly similar facial form and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular comparisons embr@@ aced Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to the G@@ act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the Gold Med@@ al G@@ by Douglas , which shows its own beautiful , wide smile , similar to the Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

viewers in the whole Canada re@@ acted quickly after they were shocked by the sound and the language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ et , &quot; Do@@ es of the C@@ BC comment@@ ator had just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers in China &quot; like a pig is dead &quot; ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ?

&quot; a different Twitter watch in Sarah &apos;s Paradi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you re@@ present the C@@ BC and Canada and lets us look like rac@@ ists .
&quot; short time later , Scott Rus@@ sel who hosted the C@@ BC broadcast live for the comment of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming output . &quot;
&quot; it was a unhappy chosen formulation , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;

the network was also used quickly and gave a message .
&quot; we sincerely regret that these statements were made , and that it was possible to be aired . &quot;
yesterday we quickly apologi@@ ze with our viewers on broadcast and to our fo@@ lo@@ wer@@ n in the social media .
&quot; to clarify , B@@ yr@@ &apos;s comments relate to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and a unhappy wording . B@@ yron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , Mac@@ Donald will apologi@@ ze in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it will be designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to comment for the comment , which I have done after the woman &apos;s rel@@ ay in the C@@ BC Olymp@@ us , he said . &quot;
I did not send myself to the performance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers in and not on them as a person .
&quot; of course , no cont@@ emp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;

&quot; the buyers did not know where to see them , when a woman pulled their clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mark to try sub@@ h@@ oses . &quot;
&quot; to wor@@ sen the situation , they numbered , as she saw in it , she pulled off and laid them back into the shelf . &quot;
she moved on and tried four pairs of under@@ p@@ ants in a shop in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark business in Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone where the wife tried the under@@ p@@ ants before she put them back to the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who had tried for the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she moved back and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of under@@ p@@ ants from the p@@ light , moved their own shr@@ ink@@ le and p@@ ants and tried them . &quot;
she did not even try to find a somewhat dis@@ crete way to do it - she just stood there &apos;s che@@ ek@@ y as O@@ sk@@ ar .
&quot; each star@@ ing , when she drew off the under@@ p@@ ants , who obviously did not like it , since she lay them into the shelf again . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three more down@@ tro@@ users , before she finally decided that her was nothing left again and went out again . &quot;
she seemed to not distur@@ b it that she watching someone - or about the person who would buy the under@@ p@@ ants in the circumstances she tried .
&quot; Ms. Davi@@ dson , 33 who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think that someone else had to take home , who had another person and which were not washed . &quot;
the incident occurred on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; as I have included , the employees tried to pull the pieces from selling , after she went - which is just as good . &quot;
&quot; I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ p@@ ants and find out that another woman had her and returned , and they were not washed away . &quot;
&quot; said a speaker from Pri@@ mark : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is the incident which occurred on Tuesday , 9 August in our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products raised in question were removed from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from ceas@@ e@@ fire
&quot; the outside world is a dangerous place , but this video from D@@ ail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it more secure for you . &quot;
&quot; we talked with Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Ver@@ ban@@ ana in New York to find out how to handle armed inc@@ ers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; whether you are approaching from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn around for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; when you turn back from behind , you should turn yourself as a pop@@ e , so that you can see your att@@ acker and move away from the flow line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
grab the weapon then between your front arm and your shoulder before you hit him with your free el@@ bows .
then hit him afterwards with the knee in the bar and rot@@ ate while the att@@ acker is br@@ anded in front of pain the weapon from his hands . beat him down to the face and move back@@ wards while putting the weapon on him .
&quot; to att@@ ackers that approach from the front , the technique is similar - move your body from the flow line , grab the gun and rot@@ ate them , so the att@@ acker can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight to the gun and hit the att@@ acker on the chest , then rot@@ ate the weapon from its grip , before they move back@@ wards and set the weapon on him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
&quot; watch the video , in order to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi last . &quot;
&quot; but remember that at a rob@@ bery in the safest , your money is too rich - if you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master . &quot;
travel@@ er Ian W@@ right sch@@ t for a guide book his tongue at the dirty places of Europe
a British travel@@ er sub@@ ordinate his immune system and wor@@ ger@@ ef@@ le@@ x for a serious examination - by doing some of the dirty and ek@@ el@@ est places in Europe .
&quot; moder@@ ator and gu@@ tor Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k scr@@ apped his course on a Euro @-@ scar@@ f , a rail@@ ing at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a sink kno@@ b of a train toi@@ lette and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
in front of the le@@ aks of each object he used a l@@ umin@@ ometer to show up and let us know what he will get .
&quot; but the experiment , which was fil@@ tered under the title &quot; &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results in day@@ light . &quot;
&quot; the thought , the dish@@ w@@ ment of a train toi@@ lette blade , which was already used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria , as well as his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left behind what he ab@@ le@@ ded , more than a bad night @-@ after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right became known to test the vi@@ ability of his intest@@ ine , traveled by the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to train stations to flush p@@ allets from toilets , the task placed his immune system definitely among a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film , he told : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , wor@@ ms and mud water . &quot;
in the film he was definitely up to his call .
&quot; the only thing he refused , was a dirty public toilet in Russia . &quot;
his prob@@ ation@@ line showed a l@@ umin@@ om@@ etry number of over 4000 units .
compared to that the L@@ umin@@ om@@ ans are more fresh and less than 60 .
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to devi@@ ate , after their lum@@ ber &apos;s number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands are one of less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the Reis@@ ef@@ il@@ m &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the bacterial number in different places such as the bathroom &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; it comes to the worst that I ger@@ o@@ ks in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing sh@@ ear@@ ite than that !
I will not swal@@ low here because it is in@@ doors .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to Inner Str@@ ength , was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the Company st@@ acked Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Ge@@ fil@@ us , which contains both l@@ actic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the support of gut bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Vice President for Snacks , S@@ hafts and New Categ@@ ories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we wanted to offer the consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of pro@@ biotics .
&quot; we brought crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ m@@ ings that ended with it , that we said &quot; L@@ ass us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about products , we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
&quot; the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary , we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way . &quot;
I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who led the director of the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I could have lost my respect for Ian , if he would have done some of the things that I have to instruc@@ ted him , like the ek@@ el@@ ty Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to le@@ aks them and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad we recorded some of those dirty goodies on film .
&quot; in one of the survey conducted by 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents carried out in particular with the wellness of g@@ astro@@ acid bacteria particularly with the wellness of stomach and intest@@ ine and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain attached l@@ actic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ social family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance Social @-@ Apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall
&quot; a as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family left her social apartment after a del@@ e@@ gi@@ ver with a damage in the amount of £ 50,000 because she was terror@@ ising their neighbours . &quot;
T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash Corn@@ wall .
&quot; after having been for@@ ci@@ bly removed from their property , they found property in an irre@@ par@@ able state . &quot;
&quot; the walls were picked up , wooden di@@ ri@@ mp@@ s were ri@@ pped up , rub@@ b@@ ish was found on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubric@@ ated to walls . &quot;
the family have been settled and it is thought that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ Ev@@ oy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that they feared that the flat no longer has to fix . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was a nightmare for people here and I believe that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , since this property may be regarded as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ walls . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also .
&quot; the couple had three sons , who lived in the middle time in the apartment and the police said that the terror that had added the family , street fights with bas@@ eb@@ all@@ y@@ ors , one shy of residents , drug abuse , drug trading and over@@ sh@@ utter papers , streams and flu@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name was on the lease agreement , was given in June an arrangement for anti @-@ social behavior . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be demol@@ ished under circumstances , old trash has been found . &quot;
&quot; they were acted in the property , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past . &quot;
neighbours said they saw them batt@@ ling on the street and periodic@@ ally had to inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing del@@ e@@ wers her and her partner this week for@@ ci@@ bly by the property after they gave them a prolonged period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ver was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They rav@@ ished about anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
&quot; the countless times , which we say the police here are incredible . &quot;
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we were standing there because it was so quiet - we are not accustomed !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that it had administered the family to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , where the police were called at regular intervals for 20 years . &quot;
on the transferred side of the municipal house they threw rub@@ b@@ ish and old toys .
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a dis@@ grace that there is a les@@ bian to accept all responsibility for their behavior and the family , as a del@@ e@@ gi@@ ver is always the last step towards Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour had to be extreme and their deeds for their neighbours had to be ab@@ omin@@ able .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the church who have gr@@ ace@@ ful to us and have given us the information . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I hope this development will give a few neighbours and give the message that the social behavior will not be tolerated . &quot;
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but they all were over 20 . &quot;
&quot; a dirty mattress , which is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after the del@@ e@@ gi@@ ver on the ground . &quot;
workers of the house management are now gr@@ asp@@ ed the garbage @-@ fields that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police conducted a raid on the house and found over 70@@ g cannabis , as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ y and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was granted a fine @-@ sentence after it was owed to the owner of a drug in the class B in merchant &apos;s view .
&quot; she said that the money for a tom@@ bst@@ one of her son Lee Skel@@ don is , who came to life in 2013 when a car accident . &quot;
&quot; after having been without shelter , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were treated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
&quot; the police says that they are deleg@@ ating r@@ enter , who do not comply with the house@@ keeping . &quot;
&quot; by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , Angela C@@ row shared a clear warning to the other tenants which do not comply with the stat@@ eh@@ ement . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can do without self @-@ accus@@ ations as well as those who were damaged by such a behaviour , &quot; she said . &quot;
police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that continue to work with partners to protect our communities .

&quot; this was the moment , in which frightened tourists will start to panic after a ti@@ pen@@ al jet desc@@ ends over a full beach . &quot;
dramatic video recordings showed such as the military plane almost in tangible vicinity of the sun lovers on the beach section in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers on when they understand@@ ably began to worry about the noise of the bowls , without going to see what came through the clouds of it . &quot;
&quot; the incident occurred yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers , the videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media post , said : &quot; &quot; it flew twice very deep and there was a moment when it looked like it would pl@@ unge . &quot;
&quot; Nun@@ o arrogan@@ ce added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane drop me down . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane comes from the dark and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Orion aircraft on a training flight was found to identify fisher@@ man boats in front of the coast and thus fly so deeply , that this is the only way to realize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet due to the poor field of sight flew down somewhat deeper than usual , however ins@@ isted the air forces ins@@ isted that the security at no time was je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; Fle@@ mish fires have destroyed this summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where four people on the island Madeira were to be put to death . &quot;
the Portuguese air forces today vo@@ iced that the pilot had to fly due to the circumstances - heavy fog and br@@ ace - as deep as that had to take off its view
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .

also Go@@ aly is missing Marc @-@ Andre Ste@@ gen .
&quot; the German suffered a change in the knee , with which the ser@@ um question at Bar@@ ca has at least been clarified in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chi@@ lean International and T@@ er Ste@@ gen weather in Barcelona have been the number one for two years .
&quot; Coach Luis Enri@@ que under@@ took a clear decision on this so far and left Bra@@ vo in the league , but he ste@@ er Ste@@ gen in most of the rest of the applicants . &quot;
&quot; before the first final game of the new season , there is a doubt about the fitness level of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the trial against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday did Li@@ on@@ el Mess@@ i and Co. were not really convincing .
&quot; Seville in turn has di@@ gest@@ ed the 2 : 3 defeat in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , and strives for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;

Ma Long in a own League for ping @-@ p@@ ong Gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis @-@ Olympi@@ asi@@ eger .
&quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old was defeated on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro in a unilater@@ al finale to its comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; &quot; New Zealand &quot; &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5 4.@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour @-@ Fin@@ alist and Olympia . &quot;
brass was given to the Japanese Jun Mi@@ best@@ os .
the two Chinese have done it as expected to be in the final game and made the title one another .
thus it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five rings .
last non @-@ Chinese at the top of the Olympics was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were on the record alone , between the sets and in time @-@ outs , they had no cre@@ aches . &quot;
they were withdrawn on the tri@@ bun@@ es and left their tren@@ ches in fair competition alone on each other .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches to here , I have played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for me , &quot; I had said Z@@ hang fol@@ ly . &quot;
after the Parti@@ cip@@ ated Gold@@ - and Silver med@@ all@@ ists with the China Flag .
the match itself was unexpected .
Ma had to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
after that he set the pace on the plate and left the slope as only a total of 13 points .
by the superiority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ cking match .
&quot; however , nonetheless , there were enough breathtaking ballo@@ ons to see . &quot;
Mi@@ best@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; the White @-@ rus@@ sian was drawn in its quarter @-@ final against the German Europ@@ ame@@ de Ov@@ ri@@ char@@ ov , and was afterwards in medical treatment , had to settle for &quot; ultimately &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
the Sweden Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were by the way very high table tennis courts .
Donald Tr@@ ump @-@ Mon@@ t ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Republi@@ can is pl@@ agu@@ ed by massive worries , even in the traditionally conservative states of the states . &quot;
presidential teacher Donald Tr@@ ump gave weaknesses of his election campaign in the previous Republi@@ can Hoch@@ burg Utah .
a rare moment in which the usually large lane and self @-@ confident Mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ aire is something like concerns expressed as correspon@@ dents .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals in the own Republi@@ can camp , from the race , the doubts grow to its success in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in Utah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in evangel@@ ical Christians , who he asked for support in important federal states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt : false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his famous media . &quot;
re@@ Republi@@ can skyscrapers
Utah is usually a safe bank for the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ ve@@ y@@ USA from June , Tr@@ ump and his conversation from the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton , disgu@@ ised by the democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see tear at the front , but not by the distance that are common to Republi@@ can candidates in the federal state . &quot;
as endangered also Arizona and Georgia apply .
&quot; in an interview of the &quot; &quot; CN@@ BC &quot; &quot; Tr@@ ump rep@@ lied to the question how he wants to stop the march of Clin@@ t : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and whether you are back : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very nice , long holiday . &quot;
he is not doing anything else than to tell the truth .
&quot; if it is not rich for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , that is ok , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to the press report , the Party of Tr@@ ump will be threatened to submit money to the support of his election campaign , he should not present better conversion values . &quot;
&quot; instead of it , one wants to turn the candidates of the Republi@@ can for Congress more strongly among the arms . &quot;
Olympia : Dre@@ ister fraud on dop@@ ing Test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arity Commission .
Kenya &apos;s athle@@ tics threatens the second D@@ oping affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud check in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach to come home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee was to set up a discipl@@ in@@ arity to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had communicated that the former Spr@@ inter and today coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic village a urine test under the name of the 800 @-@ meter L@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich released . &quot;
this was reported by the team@@ leader K@@ eni@@ as reported by the dop@@ ing chec@@ s .
&quot; the international association IA@@ AF has asked the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to approach their own studies , shared an IA@@ AF spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the following actions of the IO@@ C the IA@@ AF will make a review , &quot; it says in a IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) has gone to the D@@ oping control station and has issued himself as a F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , the sample issued and signed , &quot; stated Ken@@ y@@ as chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p SO@@ I . &quot;
he was in possession of the ac@@ creditation of athletes who stood on the list for training control in the world Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Championship @-@ Fourth over 800 meters .
four days ago was the Ken@@ yan Or@@ ch@@ ta@@ le@@ tic Deleg@@ ation@@ ary Michael Rot@@ i had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio @-@ Games .
he is said to have informed about money @-@ payments of his country on the dop@@ ing Test .
media reports said that he was arrested in Nairobi at his return at the airport .
Kenya is standing on IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing associations since long time under special observation .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target safety controls before the Rio @-@ Games , it was reported that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia are taken into account . &quot;
the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer of summer to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before Olympia .
&quot; as a consequence , W@@ ada Kenya took from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing to fight against the rules of W@@ ada . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ nation .
the athle@@ tics of the country won the most medals at the World Cup 2015 in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of television reports of the ARD , the ARD have always been raised again to be easily accessible in Kenya &apos;s dop@@ ing means and to give it a considerable mentality of the sport . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C @-@ member Richard Po@@ und recently demanded a similar investigation in Kenya , as he had asked her in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
yet it could be proven that in this sport area and systematically educated .
&quot; as a result of Russia &apos;s athle@@ tics , we were excluded from the summer . &quot;
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Cecilia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ year the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Cecilia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conquered Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story &quot; , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ st@@ eins masterpiece . &quot;
the artistic director Cecilia Bart@@ oli wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled up with the role of Mary a youth .
in orchestr@@ al the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ elan Di@@ ri@@ gen@@ ten Gust@@ avo Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm . &quot;
we always say that they are very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we are Bern@@ st@@ eins &apos;s music really in our blood !
in this staging Bart@@ oli plays an older sister Maria .
she remembers with melanchol@@ y to her beloved with Tony , while the younger Mary plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then it would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty , oh so Pre@@ t@@ ty , I feel Pre@@ t@@ ty and wit@@ ty and B@@ right . &quot;
&quot; so she is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character , whom I have seen as a Roman , lau@@ ghing Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the Opera singer : &quot; Cecilia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honor to work with her .
it is a immen@@ sely generous human .
and Bart@@ oli gives the compli@@ ment back : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and very passionate ! &quot;
he is for him a necessity .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it &apos;s such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and also a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
for the American film@@ maker Philip World Cup . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley the &quot; West Side Story &quot; is up to date : &quot; in this piece it is about prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we took the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ ert@@ ans have gone to New York , and the New York inhabitants did not want them . &quot;
these are the same issues and they are as meaningful today as it was at that time .
59 years later the piece is still relevant .

S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA was 17 years old and died after particulars of her family shortly after she had pre @-@ conquered the war@@ ring country and return to England .
&quot; one can only hope that the only good lies in it - as a reminder and warning to others , that these are the risks associated with it - to prevent people from being able to ever make this decision , &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , S@@ UL@@ TA@@ NA and two other school@@ maid rose from the east of London in a plane to Turkey and subsequently into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;

&quot; due to the hard court of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan , after the coup , the Kurdish community was expecting a mass arrest in Germany . &quot;
&quot; at short notice I reck@@ on with ten thousand thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands who fought Turkey in the medium term , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continued to combat the minorities and democratic opposition , &quot; says the &quot; &quot; President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; from Friday . &quot;

&quot; in 2005 , the country @-@ election is not returned immediately at the end of the summer holidays , the central Parliament has already decided in the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for so far it does not go : summer holidays , heat and land @-@ day sti@@ ckers - which is bites . &quot;
the locals who are to be convinced of the constitu@@ ents are on holiday .
&quot; most vac@@ ation@@ ers , who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not native , so they are not allowed to choose the day of the country . &quot;
&quot; practical problems arise : in the holidays are hel@@ pers to hang out the posters , air bub@@ bles , fl@@ yers , and put out at the end of the voices , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election of the election and the last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to come with an election campaign in close to the people over the race . &quot;
&quot; the hot stage , if one can say this at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it is also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win cel@@ ering , leader of a SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid for his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , since 1998 strongest party , is now clear in surveys behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
thrilling will discover how strongly new@@ com@@ er Af@@ D cuts and what remains at the end of co@@ ali@@ fication .
&quot; S@@ ella , 66 years old and since 2008 Prime Minister , has an almost un@@ ic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from its large pl@@ itude . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the land , spread ro@@ ses and ch@@ atting a little with the people , just as it did before his legendary @-@ cali@@ ger predecessor Harald Ring@@ stor@@ ff . &quot;
otherwise we received sailors from the old guard and gives the chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel the blame for the blos@@ som@@ ing of the Af@@ D .
&quot; their refugee policy , you &quot; &quot; We will create &quot; &quot; the rise of right @-@ wing popul@@ ists , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top performance data , the Interior Minister Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you are at the wrong time in the right place of campaign . &quot;
she has invited two chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major speakers ; Merkel &apos;s Par@@ ag@@ onal Association is located in the northeast .
&quot; but the target group does not coinci@@ de , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Co@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; it is also a pity , from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel . &quot;
otherwise the North @-@ CD@@ U disp@@ ens@@ ed largely on the usual electoral campa@@ igning on market places and mainly shopping centers with umbrellas and air balloon .
&quot; that , so co@@ ke , plays only an &quot; inferior role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union noted , too , that you must cut down the base from the land that it must exert much on the land to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; you are all about the left , the SPD , the Greens : in the expan@@ se of the country hardly any present . &quot;
&quot; however , the Council of the CD@@ U campaign co@@ ert in his collaborators , however , is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; they need to go where it we@@ h@@ eth , namely where men are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because much is at stake , Sell@@ ering has now called his SPD to a particularly dedicated electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats have last less than 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just under the Af@@ ales ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD had made it clear with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in front of CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Greens , small party with seven percent in the pol@@ ls are likely to create the leap in the country &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; they make a modern virtue of the holidays , and put it in the internet place in its election . &quot;
&quot; online @-@ election &quot; , &quot; it is called the CEO of Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green constitu@@ ents embark on the search for indigenous people among the tourists . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ jek , the top @-@ did@@ acy , cur@@ v@@ t just with a house@@ boat through the m@@ ec@@ kl@@ en@@ bur@@ gian lakes and finds it even more beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a penalty . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 @-@ Rehabilitation : Gast@@ ro@@ wers suffer from blocking
&quot; in the speed , with which the B 27 is fin@@ alized , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; for those responsible for the construction of the construction work , starting at 5.@@ 30 am and only at 8 o &apos;clock , there is no praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything quite cr@@ ack@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ l@@ aff from the Jet Gas station . &quot;
this is a super@@ team .
there is no trans@@ gres@@ sions .
&quot; the construction site could be moved on the weekend of the half @-@ time as scheduled to the south , until the end of October everything will be ready . &quot;
&quot; blessed will also be the disposal of those responsible for construction work , e.g. when it comes to setting homes . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site started on Monday to the south , and the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again relaxed , the traffic situation is relaxed within the place . &quot;
the citizens can now move from O@@ f@@ ter@@ dingen from B 27 at the same time .
the so@@ fter transport through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were partly considerable complaints , &quot; &quot; says the responsible management of the re@@ engineering management of the responsible chief executive director Florian King . &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of Bach@@ man &apos;s road , Stein@@ l@@ ach@@ straße , haf@@ i Road and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many sten@@ tions were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i trusted as the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to that there are some truck in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limit are not observed , the community requested the mess@@ aging from M@@ ös@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; there was considerable acquisitions , &quot; says King , who himself was on the spot for himself . &quot;
two to three per minute has already been lit@@ tered .
the quick@@ est was traveling with 77 kilometers per hour in the pace @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; moved on since the construction site , it was qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at B 27 it is only a little comfort that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg now the street is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look in the maps .
&quot; but that the B 27 @-@ rehabilitation in them has led to sales revenue , each one is asked to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some more and some are less affected . &quot;
&quot; who has less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customers &quot; , &quot; thus for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; in the Aut@@ oh@@ aus Mai@@ er , Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; maximum decline , &quot; &quot; but also that &quot; &quot; the running of course is missing . &quot; &quot;
the most exploited are the shops along the road .
&quot; Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have taken it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; missing the customers from He@@ ch@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ tw@@ eil . &quot;
we must be glad about each euro turnover .
&quot; the sales revenue include &quot; &quot; at &quot; &quot; far above 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road@@ test has thrown its operation &quot; by two years . &quot;
half of his employees have to release him .
&quot; if I would have a company with 4000 employees and the half had been released , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , if there could be a financial compensation , with the reference , the restaurant benef@@ itted from the advantages of the location at the B . now it must also take the disadvantages , which carry out through the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows of other coun@@ ties where something was tra@@ ded .
in all K@@ agues G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue .
&quot; after all , the family business has been located since 17@@ 15 , he points to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now due to complicated transport management less frequently subject to ch@@ ew , he can understand . &quot;
if you can &apos;t go there it is also somewhere else .
&quot; that his tribal cli@@ ent@@ el came back after the end of the restoration work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubt . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BS@@ E and avi@@ an influenza , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the impact of the B 27 construction work on its manifestation for the greatest crisis , which has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; constantly , in the name of the terrorist fight against laws . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now a big security package . &quot;
but what has a D@@ ul@@ um status to do with terror ?
and what does the co@@ ali@@ an partners say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Re@@ conc@@ iler .
&quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; politically reasonable , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Minister for the presentation of his new safety package . &quot;
you are asking for anyone .
&quot; other , further points would be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also participate in it .
&quot; but as the Minister of Interior , he was able to give him results and to a &quot; &quot; for@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère &apos;s recent attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach presented a little time before it presents its conclusions for security in the Republic .
&quot; however , they are all the more extensive . &quot;
&quot; a lot is already known , announced that a new security authority should take care of the b@@ aking co@@ ded communication , is not new . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is also not the fact that Germany must implement several EU specifications on aircraft gas data and weapons . &quot;
the call for more video surveillance and staff for the security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; partly , the Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second call for proposals that have not been made with the SPD so far : he wants to dis@@ miss the terrorist groups under punishment and dis@@ car@@ p the jihadists with a double citizen . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; spatial the CD@@ U @-@ man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is still reasonable for reasonable and also demanding nothing that in the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ ists anyway have no chance . &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère also presents a few new ideas in Mai@@ zi@@ ère .
they partially exemp@@ t them : he is planning the quick@@ ening procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the imprisonment of people prior to deportation .
refugees who are well fet@@ ched into the country should first check their smartphone in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety check examination .
&quot; with D@@ ul@@ ties for distr@@ acted asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than so far - such as such , crimes commit or throw away their papers to conce@@ al their identity . &quot;
some of it is political and legally native .
man@@ ches also has an un@@ tested and leaves questions open .
and in some points - in the un@@ equal treatment of Ged@@ ser@@ ed for example - raises the question : what does that actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
&quot; however , it cannot be said that the kill@@ ings of Ans@@ bach and Wür@@ zburg were refugees . &quot;
many people in view of the high refugee flow are worried about safety .
&quot; and things that are deeply employed people , have now not settled in election times even in election times . &quot;
the inner security is enormously advanced .
&quot; first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach .
the assurance is great .
&quot; and yes , there are campaigns . &quot;
Union and SPD are therefore increasingly taking place on the issue of internal security .
in the last days we went high between the two parties .
&quot; first a gar@@ bit argument over the equipment of the Federal Police , then on a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons @-@ Interior , who also calls for the res@@ ent@@ ele as well as a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the double citizenship . &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also lab@@ orious here for irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able sounds .
from a return from a double pass he considers nothing .
we have lost the discussion in Germany .
&quot; to re@@ construct , be not useful . &quot;
and with a Bur@@ ka ban he has constitutional concerns .
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tive at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; is for the co@@ ali@@ er partner , it has to show itself only . &quot;
there is a lot in it that could worry about dispute .
&quot; however , the SPD also tries to profile themselves on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; Par@@ eich@@ ef Sig@@ mar Gabriel sign@@ alized only a cautious talk and say , &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
still Volkswagen g@@ lim@@ p comes through .
&quot; despite diesel @-@ and@@ als , the payout percent@@ ages rise worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs around .
on the back @-@ back campaign there is a concept around a term .
Volkswagen will start the second half @-@ year with the ship@@ ments for the second half @-@ year .
&quot; in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ run markets , Europe &apos;s biggest exit can continue to advance a plus in spite of the diesel engine , thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ run markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July the core brand VW , in particular was weak@@ ened in Western Europe and is again dist@@ res@@ sing the total sale of how the company noted in D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars 1.8 percent less than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , to China the second most important market , sales remained 14 percent below the prior @-@ year @-@ year period . &quot;
&quot; in the home market , Germany s@@ ack@@ ed the supplies to almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; leader Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann , the weaker figures from July mainly lead to two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there have been a modified economic framework in some core markets by &quot; changing economic framework . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup in Turkey , the British vote on res@@ ignation from the EU was deb@@ ated , explained a speaker . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the car@@ bure@@ tor first escal@@ ated first , there is also further a minus too be@@ ech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly interested party brand of the Lower Saxony is largely dependent on the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an output minus of 0,@@ 9 percent is to 3,@@ 37 million vehicles to be@@ ech . &quot;
Chief Executive Director Fred Kap@@ pler was able to further advance a sales unit from January to July .
&quot; 1,3 percent more vehicles delivered Volkswagen in this period , around EUR 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated with a software engineer .
in Germany VW alone is calling for 2.5 million cars to upgrade into the workshops .
&quot; in the course of the re@@ armament , VW , that the reconstruction of the cars did not have any negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ armament of vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor power . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ makers present the customer after the conversion of a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate , but do not speak of a &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; as it was on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
the reason are legal entities .
&quot; the &quot; Focus &quot; had reports to its German customers now a guarantee for ru@@ sted diesel models .
this was confirmed by the last Monday VW representatives in the State Department .
the traffic department has been confirmed that there was this meeting .
&quot; VW has been able to fulfill the requirements of my investigation , and by KBA . &quot;
&quot; devi@@ ations from this are not accepted , &quot; stated Federal Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that with fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine output after the re@@ armament will no longer be held and all type @-@ approved vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot;
Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; guar@@ ant@@ y &quot; but not as it was in business travel .
&quot; the wide term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; provides the possibility that customers come for example a half year after the retro@@ fitting for example with an engine damage to a workshop - and this could lead to the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; even in customer interest , it is important to avoid that at any other damage , who don &apos;t have anything to do with the sc@@ ass@@ ass@@ andal over which it meant , as it meant . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see requires considerable savings in the future in Germany - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; the Bank of Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it is only about 139 customers , who park 40 million euros on g@@ ro@@ - or day @-@ to @-@ date accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Bundes@@ verband Deutscher banks speaks of an individual case and does not see a signal &quot; &quot; normal austerity &quot; &quot; does not have to fear for their savings criminal offen@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; stores banks charge on night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay her 0,@@ 4 percent pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; this fee requires the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank G@@ mund back from September of private and corporate clients for deposits over 100,000 euros on gyp@@ sum or day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 Euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost € 400 euros a year , &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; he hat@@ s for 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to another , and which he could not fail . &quot;
&quot; those lying in me at the central bank account and cause 0.@@ 4 percent costs , &quot; &quot; said the banker . &quot;
&quot; I cannot lay down for each one million 4,000 Euro . &quot;
the costs he now give to the caus@@ ation principle .
&quot; the cash simply lying in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have experienced four survivors , I don &apos;t know yet the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; the bank@@ note stood . &quot;
most of the customers would have an understanding and varied on other investment forms .
only a few hikes to other banks .
&quot; the Gen@@ os@@ co @-@ association Bayern explained : &quot; the extreme monetary policy course of the ECB is causing significant costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; they alone to bear , be &quot; &quot; commercially viable not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks therefore have increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros , the Thur@@ in@@ gian Pop@@ ular and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank Alten@@ burger had made head@@ lines with their sk@@ ating bank branch 2014 head@@ lines . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , captain of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay for deposits for deposits , so the competition in Germany among banks and savings banks have much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a banker said , &quot; &quot; T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see &quot; &quot; give it a cliff , which is a bit of lav@@ ish from the property . &quot;
this can be a problem for a small bank if they hat@@ ch for free money .
&quot; the cooperative cooperative bank G@@ mund founded two branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach , Cre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; in the region , well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the cooperative union of Bavaria , there are currently no further banks known that charge a compens@@ ate for deposits of private customers , &quot; said speaker Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German People and Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen@@ bank banks ( B@@ v@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go into the neg@@ atives , is very , very high . &quot;
competition is hard and it dro@@ ves the emigr@@ ation of investors to competition .
the customers in Germany will not be dropped in the same width .
destination plates : who actually buys sound plates ?
lonely men &apos;s middle age love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the commentary box to re@@ viewing him under the alias of non @-@ le@@ vel@@ ing men with rus@@ sian insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the multip@@ licity of sound plates is not attribut@@ able to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als who wish to greet the re@@ union of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most likely buyer . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des through Hob@@ by@@ collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older plate ti@@ sts retain their feelings for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy it to spend time ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog would be a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while in the midst of a busy road in Soh@@ o , a humble point , keep my hands and wild as : &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let us take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even though the heart of So@@ hos slowly comes to its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores . &quot;
&quot; I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops , and try to assess their age and minds . &quot;
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , whom I mean by S@@ ister Ray ( data number : two young women , three men middle age ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( data number , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
is he a collector that I ask ?
&quot; I guess it &apos;s already , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approximately 3,000 or 4,000 plates . &quot;
&quot; this record , depicted on the top ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not return home ) , dress up the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles , the result of his available income : he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as she appeared and again buy items that he sold , when he was young and ple@@ aded . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70@@ ies , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things where I probably was too young to buy them , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records , rather more intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time , and add : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink much . &quot;
this is my lo@@ aster .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 who works at S@@ ister Ray , believes that many customers who meets the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medi@@ enh@@ pe , people who have heard about the com@@ eback , and set themselves to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually have taken away their collection in order to be emp@@ tied in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs , sell now their CDs to buy her records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of trailers of the plate of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional significance of plates ?
&quot; it takes only a few seconds in a shop like ph@@ onica , to realize that record stores provides a soothing community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to WE@@ Z , some of the older customers participated in the non @-@ contact payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar sound@@ boards , from objects that bl@@ iss@@ ful Ju@@ gen@@ der@@ mic appeals . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions , as a kind of con@@ sol@@ ation , &quot; says WE@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; this is with me as collectors , and I think that it is so many people . &quot;
it is a simple way to get spiritually .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; fl@@ aps an employee from a record stack .
&quot; a survey conducted by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people bought a record from the last month , they have not yet heard . &quot;
&quot; the survey took also out that 41 % have a record player that they never use , whereas 7 % of those who buy a record , have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of news report , I would probably look very concerned as I blo@@ om through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works in sounds of the Universe ( data number : three men middle aged ) , has noticed one &quot; tro@@ phy &quot; of Re@@ vi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone only came here and said , &quot; &quot; I do not have a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a radi@@ oh@@ ead record , so I can put it into the shelf , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less musi@@ cl@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I have no record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older , which will come slowly . &quot;
&quot; stop@@ over , dedicated to the gram@@ ophone almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience , when I go . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ ager and women aged . &quot;
&quot; even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Be@@ asts newest synthes@@ iz@@ ers and sex@@ stra@@ ddle pop , instead of experimental jazz , no@@ ds out of the loud@@ speakers - it &apos;s good to see such diversity among the customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks sunny , but wet mental trau@@ mas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs for some minutes in the business and considers the variation of the plates available for sale . &quot;
it is more of a bu@@ zz@@ ling bum@@ ble@@ bee as a large purchase .
&quot; it does not deserve much , therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option , it says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
it is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; she drives with a loved disease .
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it really is unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ f@@ itters .
&quot; while I give the semb@@ lance of mu@@ sts the jeans hot@@ p@@ ants , I watched a group of young teenagers who are group@@ ed for a moment to buy Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter contem@@ plate , buy a crossover record . &quot;
&quot; on the left is a stair@@ well , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , Amy Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative , some are so far above that it is impossible to grasp them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record @-@ art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry , and some customers could send into the depths of So@@ hos for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others , also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects special offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial hearing this week argued the authorities in Cal@@ ais , that the state should be authorized to sell 72 pro@@ vision@@ aries in which individuals within the camp goods , sell from cigarettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in provisional restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be crus@@ hed , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which carry on fire and san@@ ity risk . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that the shops and restaurants are important , as the free meals offered by the state supported association and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the provisional shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need . &quot;
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who run the 72 pro@@ visional business , but adm@@ its that the concerns of the pre@@ fecture of Cal@@ ais are absolutely comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; the judge Jean @-@ François Mol@@ la said that the grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much bigger role than just people who live &quot; in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas of calm meeting point between refugees and volunteers offer .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the vir@@ le Book Kids &apos; Cafe of the camp , the common and French classes as well as advice on Asyl@@ um , for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 17@@ 0.000 people have signed the petition , to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it meant that the closure &quot; &quot; for these children would be a catastrophe , of which the most recent eight years are old . &quot;
the two aid organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Migr@@ ants estimated that the number of people in the jungle camp living on more than 9.@@ 000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase of new@@ com@@ ers in the course of summer .
despite Olympia @-@ disappointment : Martin remains militant
&quot; despite his dis@@ continuing performance in the olymp@@ ic time , Rad@@ prof@@ i Tony Martin will not be able to do this . &quot;

a statement for his miserable twel@@ fth place in twel@@ fth place he did not have .
&quot; to me it was honest badly to comment the time of yesterday , &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; it must be analysed in peace , which reasons would have led to the deb@@ acle . &quot;
Martin actually wanted to fight the title at the time of time World Cup in Qatar .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany Ras@@ a must adapt to the next generation of speed measurement : in various federal states , among other things in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flash devices will be tested , the tem@@ pos@@ iting of the most effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler of the company Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can be used for example on accident points , where it would be dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction or to sandy bridges with temporary Tem@@ ples , there is often no necessary infrastructure to provide a stationary standard for compliance with speed limit . &quot;
a permanent mobile setup can be too dangerous or consuming .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : his battery holds five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
laser measurement technology can also be recorded at the same time all vehicles over several tracks simultaneously .
variable speed limit as well as transit information after time , loop and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
you can move the trailer according to the manufacturer with any car with p@@ endant cl@@ utch .
&quot; so that it is not easy to load , it is lowered in the measuring run , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and incidentally also f@@ aint out@@ fit disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the Bl@@ itzer against V@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer for information about Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently France has bought 100 pieces , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
great Britain fet@@ ches Silver in the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master Class Gold
the impressive performance of Britain at the 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came in the final on Thursday evening at a ab@@ rupt halt at the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were be@@ aten up with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ c stage here in Rio .
&quot; Fi@@ ji is shared a master class in the handling , side @-@ Step@@ ping , pi@@ ping , line @-@ run and ro@@ her strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot;
&quot; defeat was failed by the non @-@ too bad tro@@ phy of the silver medal - Britain fourth in that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the strong defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ finals on the same day could be dropped to them in the final . &quot;
but irrespective of it Fi@@ ji would have taken part in this form a 15 @-@ man team .
&quot; it could be a con@@ sol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a tan morning will hang a gold medal to his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is Chef@@ trainer Ben Ry@@ an , the former head of England from Wimbledon . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind them .
eight years ago she lost at Ry@@ an every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this work@@ book will be we@@ h@@ off , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began wonderful and made the attacks GB@@ s from fun waste .
&quot; it felt for the captain Tom Mitchell at and Co . on , as if one would walk in driving buses . the World Series winner went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au went into the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jerry Tu@@ wai added another attack from the right corner , which he changed . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly points the ball .
&quot; a res@@ ignation of Mitchell stopped the mountain from man Leone Nak@@ ar@@ awa to achieve a third goal , but it has stopped Fi@@ ji only . &quot;
in the seventh minute J@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ al@@ ua in the right corner a touch @-@ down and there stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
Nak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the res@@ tro@@ ff and there was still a minute time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u squee@@ zed through further weak T@@ ail@@ ings of the GB team and rus@@ hed up to line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to a break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while UK still falls . &quot;
so it is also .
&quot; GB led basic changes to mid @-@ time by and closed the fi@@ ji@@ c gap ... for whole four minutes , which was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time , to Joshua Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch @-@ down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game worked for a long time in favor of the South @-@ ein@@ sul@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sh@@ out and danced on the ble@@ ach@@ ers . &quot;
it was not hard to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the cake with a further attempt in recent seconds .
&quot; the p@@ fi@@ ff , the Fi@@ j@@ is embr@@ aced , and GB ki@@ cked mur@@ der@@ ly in the la@@ wns . &quot;
previously on the day Fi@@ ji Japan had conquered the semi @-@ finals with 20 @-@ 5 and the United Kingdom pressed South Africa in a half @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Great Britain transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the bo@@ k in the first half to the front , but Dan Nor@@ ton collap@@ sed the line with an impressive foot and recorded a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant ceremony by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side teams , secured the profit - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fighting with the cancer of the trainer to ro@@ w@@ win
there will be no em@@ ot@@ in@@ aler@@ es gold than with these games and that will mean what .
&quot; from the first rowing machines to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve that go into history , Helen Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an extra meaning in her golden moment on the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if it was only the two who sat at the Ru@@ der , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was all present as they ru@@ ined for the second Olympi@@ ad in two without any tax wife , who used the first women in the history of British Sports that had such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her dominance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter untreated action , which is also un@@ parall@@ eled . &quot;
what we see are two brilliant athle@@ te who gli@@ ding across the surface with the elegance of Spon@@ ges which is not reflected the way of the triumph@@ al .
&quot; behind each gold in the rowing , a batt@@ ali@@ on contributes to wil@@ dered hel@@ pers that make up the difference and no one was more fri@@ ghtening than the coach , who would not know that day at all , when he was diagnosed with him cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he is risky . &quot;
&quot; I had blasph@@ emy , which is oper@@ able and did it . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a fairly bad situation .
it changes a little bit the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio had luck that they were treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , begin what the break was on a minimum , if that under such circumstances is the correct term . &quot;
I needed money so I had to go back soon .
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and ran at the station around - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would be sufficient . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger . &quot;
&quot; in the im@@ medi@@ ability of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wre@@ cking tomorrow to talk something more than usual and thus tried to process its own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was as captain in the Royal Arti@@ ll@@ ery Reg@@ iment in an employment in Afghanistan , &quot; &quot; I was this week an emotional wre@@ ck . that is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it repe@@ ats how much that means me , how much I and Helen and also Robin worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , therefore a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I could not have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up with their opponents .
&quot; even during the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had started up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had much in reserve . &quot;
we were very trapped at the moment .
&quot; Helen called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , abi@@ ding in the process . &quot;
it is really important to not let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making something great .
&quot; we did not want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race as we did . &quot;
the pair will take a time for a year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver will have to appear at a wedding next week , your own with the TV @-@ adv@@ ent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that could have been a much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am a Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
here it took about four minutes .
&quot; it feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
31 years pre @-@ exemplary for clarity at all times
&quot; the director of the &quot; &quot; V@@ eit@@ ing &quot; &quot; group , R@@ up@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , goes retirement . &quot;
the Association is regarded as &quot; Bav@@ arian . &quot; &quot;
a small fresh drinking water @-@ purpose association as a role model for the big water manufacturers .
this was the name of some time ago in the press on the Bay@@ er@@ ischer Rund@@ funk &apos;s article .
little later the water forum of the Government of Unter@@ fran@@ ken became the purpose association .
the work of the V@@ eit@@ ed group called &quot; Bav@@ arian &quot; than exemplary . &quot;
&quot; all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler , who was 31 years in the Second World association , 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; now , he was retired in retirement in the age of 65 . &quot;
&quot; drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ eit@@ dorf group with headquarters in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality latitude , promotes about 150@@ ,000 cu@@ bic meters of water and supplies 32 places and windows with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; member municipalities are the churches of Kirch@@ lou@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the city of Baun@@ ach . &quot;
for further towns and villages there are water supply contracts .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ns &apos;s mayor in Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler was set in 1985 as water atten@@ dant and was appointed to the general manager of the two @-@ association association . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they have been extended by the water @-@ conduc@@ tion and maintenance activities , the budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency sets on weekends , &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; outstanding events they called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new well ( 1994 ) , plot purchases in the area of the new well ( 1998 ) and compensation for farmers , the restructuring of the plan@@ ters ( 1999 ) , the re @-@ creation of a central computer controller ( 2004 ) , and the divi@@ ders of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no stand@@ still and you have always recorded any new additions because water lives and drinking water the most important food .
&quot; in her Lau@@ d@@ ati@@ o they praised Gö@@ llers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water@@ purpose association and he has lived off the water@@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , he served as a genuine practitioner to present the track record of the V@@ eit@@ ing Group to the nit@@ rate strategy in front of the water forum of the district Unter@@ fran@@ ken . &quot;
for this he has received a lot of recognition and praise .
Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler praised wat@@ ered Al@@ f@@ ons Sem@@ bel who worked together with him 28 years .
he is the best water atten@@ dant and he was a devoted bu@@ gger .
together we were an unbeatable team .
&quot; as the highlights from his point of view , he recorded the well @-@ name and the re @-@ structured of the purpose association . &quot;
the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the pi@@ ping at the Hoch@@ container at church lou@@ der on a 3rd January .
&quot; here , minus 17 degrees all night had to work throughout , so that the loc@@ alities could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn one can only entertain because one filled the cus@@ hion from P@@ ett@@ stadt with s@@ lan@@ ets .
the management of drinking water purpose was handed over to Daniel falls from Lau@@ ter who joins the succession of Ru@@ pert G@@ öl@@ ler .

a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man died on Friday against 10.@@ 45 in a multi@@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and were fatal .
&quot; the man himself inv@@ oked with us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ person . &quot;
&quot; the offen@@ ders be on the run , after him will be publicly spot@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile nationwide , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1,@@ 80 meters large , muscular , brown , brown and has a g@@ ossi@@ p . &quot;
meanwhile the police have released a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
meanwhile the man carries a g@@ ossi@@ p .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could also carry the weapon with himself , so the police . &quot;
who Sven S. looks like the 110 is going to call .
the police speaks of an &quot; relationship stat . &quot;
&quot; the victim is vintage 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; in Lü@@ beck , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck initially did not want to make statements about the obligation or the relationship between perpetrators and victims , but confirmed that a human being killed . &quot;
&quot; it is a killing delicate . &quot; &quot; &quot;

steel - bright spot for the German steel industry
the cr@@ amped and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry remains spar@@ ed by additional costs in million@@ aires .
&quot; financial burden , that threaten the industry from the organic promotion , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the liberation of the Renewable Energi@@ es @-@ Com@@ position in the components for so @-@ called equity production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German General Newspaper &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Fri@@ day@@ . ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we were finally able to reach negotiations after two years .
&quot; the European Commission therefore initially planned to use the steel producers , the gases from the ho@@ cho@@ es to generate electricity generation for their own consumption , to checkout . &quot;
the steel industry amoun@@ ted to additional costs of 120 to 240 million Euros per year .
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z and now I &apos;m giving a key@@ certificate with the European Commission for talks with competition commission@@ er Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel structures , an EEG re@@ position of 20 percent will be replaced . &quot;
&quot; however , this will not be raised in the steel industry . &quot;
the IG Metall greeted the agreement of Germany with the European Commission on self @-@ reliance .
thus the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined .
special importance have the successful effort of Gabriel for the steel industry .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; steel is the future &apos; , that is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others have to follow . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; even when the reform of the emission standards are &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets &quot; , &quot; IG Metall leader Jörg Hof@@ mann stated in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
last year the situation intensified more than the world &apos;s largest producer in China put in view of the weak@@ ening of domestic demand in the world market .
European manufacturers throw Chinese steel @-@ compliant price @-@ dumping .
in the course of this spring the situation has something relaxed .
&quot; on the one hand , import duties on import st@@ ole effect , on the other hand the economic prospects in China have been enligh@@ tened . &quot;
unclear how sustain@@ ably the price re@@ conditioning is up .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p remained careful on Thursday .
finally the prices would have to be st@@ agn@@ ated again .
the industry is responding to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ K@@ rup@@ p most recently wanted to exclude the end of individual works .
&quot; at the end of 2015 , around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
the German steel producers remain careful despite increasing prices and increasing orders .
they produced more than 3.4 million tons of good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year on the previous year .
after a short increase in May the amount of the second month went back to each other .
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production is around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the Association expects an improved order situation with a rising output . &quot;
&quot; community , Spirit , Health : singing is doing seniors &quot;
&quot; the singing has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp already their whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the teacher study she defeated the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old in a senior choir . &quot;
&quot; singing me - emotional and physically , &quot; describe them . &quot;
&quot; after a sample , it feels balanced , cheerful and altogether more lively , she says . &quot;
&quot; right next , they do something good in their health and mind . &quot;
&quot; for S@@ ingen is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors , says Erhard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German population of seniors . &quot;
&quot; most seniors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people &apos;s joy in music , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
being regular exercise can tie and maintain social contacts .
&quot; because often social and family structures emerge in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also has made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense - says H@@ ac@@ kler .
for here they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing .
who regularly asks his lungs as well as everyday life is not as fast as the Pu@@ est .
&quot; even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people we often have a very special effect , Ursula L@@ enz says of the Federal Association of Sen@@ iors @-@ Organ@@ iz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the joint S@@ ingen had a much higher priority , it was part of everyday life , both at school and in leisure time . &quot;
L@@ enz is often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people ar@@ ouses many memories often associated with positive feelings of their adol@@ escent age .
through Li@@ ed@@ tex@@ te and especially tunes herself denied or denied people back for a long time .
&quot; when singing the head is also required for a special power , says L@@ enz . &quot;
at the same time concentrate on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge .
&quot; just older people who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on herself . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
also the self @-@ esteem grows by the singing in the choir .
&quot; to show themselves : when I go for a long time , I will better and alert over myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start with the singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby , should not hesitate - even if he means a little talent , betra@@ ying L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who h@@ ears it , when a sound goes on it ? &quot;
looking for the right offer have seniors various opportunities , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; sings someone from the acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a seniors , you can simply connect . &quot;
many cities also offer views of choirs in the area .
&quot; who wants to sing in a church choir , can contact the church or the church leader . &quot;
many elderly people can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; who has no access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbours may ask for help with the inter@@ ne@@ tre@@ che . &quot;
&quot; who lust has to sing , should necessarily join a choir , betra@@ ying H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;

bi@@ ologists have examined in Hannover which effect the rep@@ ute of fel@@ bab@@ ys on adult animals has .
&quot; to their surprise , the males also did not leave the males cold - however , they always thought the difference to the females always equal . &quot;
female cats can recognize the sof@@ tening of cat bab@@ ys on the ch@@ ew of the little ones .
they react to ten percent faster to Lau@@ te of kittens who have found themselves in great need such as scientists from the veterin@@ arian School and the Medical School Hannover ( MH@@ H ) .
&quot; males also react to the herds of kittens , but always equal . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between the ch@@ ew of less and strongly aroused young , for the males either is not percep@@ tible or not of meaning , &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding from the MH@@ H . &quot;
&quot; it is the first author of the study , which was published on this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a previous investigation , the research team had already found that the duration and sound level of the kittens with the urgency of their support must be distinguished . &quot;
&quot; in total , nine adult men and eight women were observed from the shelter of the MH@@ H . &quot;
they were played for a sum@@ p of little ones who were taken for three minutes from the Wur@@ f@@ box and were separated from mother and si@@ blings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were faced with scre@@ aming of more aroused kittens who were also lifted up high up . &quot;
the researchers consider their results despite the low sample of the sample for expres@@ sive .
&quot; all the females , even those who had not yet had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
they turned to be faster to the speakers when this call@@ ings of the very aroused kittens played .
this ability may possibly be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; one surprise was that the males have at all re@@ acted , &quot; &quot; said the Bi@@ olog@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already investigated several times when people studied the reactions of women and men in baby @-@ noise . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were sensitive to infants , regardless of whether they were already mothers or not , the Bi@@ olog@@ in Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski attacks with &quot; Gala &quot; after Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , a arrest warran@@ t was issued against the erst@@ while football star of Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver . &quot;
he was accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup , Turkey will again be an important soccer game . &quot;
before the du@@ el of the Arch@@ bishop between Col@@ kt@@ as Istanbul and Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul to the Super@@ cup in Kon@@ ya is the official line clearly : &quot; business as &quot; is said .
&quot; already at the suspension of the emergency , after the overthrow of the emergency , the government , the everyday life of normal brus@@ h@@ ers should not be com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; but this does not apply to those that are suspected , the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup . &quot;
&quot; thereby , the football will not stop . &quot;
&quot; against the former St@@ ark@@ i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r , the Public Pro@@ secutor filed an arrest warran@@ t . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South of America has been accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; South kis@@ ses should be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is held responsible for the coup , President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ y@@ ip Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although it is especially true for 90 days of state of emergency until October , in fact it has no effect on the life of most Turks but as good as no effects . &quot;
the ni@@ ghtly &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; on public places throughout the country Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday .
the sport is - as the whole country - split in supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club @-@ club visits are traditionally not among the friends of the President .
but what the Gro@@ s of the Turks but in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats at Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Si@@ kt@@ as .
&quot; at Po@@ kal@@ si@@ eger &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; it will be especially arriving on Luke Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
its sporty value was the Köl@@ ner in the past season showed proof : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old was finishing his first time as the top scor@@ er of his association .
in the final game against F@@ ener@@ bah@@ ce he obtained the 1 : 0 @-@ Sieg@@ tre@@ k .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; bu@@ ked him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he completed the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; , &quot; the disappointing season for the record champion was a conc@@ il@@ able conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the round @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League the &quot; lions &quot; will also appear early in the Europe League . &quot;
in the South with Li@@ g there was only rank six .
the season was not good .
tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed and this is the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master K@@ kt@@ as the game year was better .
&quot; above all thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 seasonal figures as the South per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ scor@@ en@@ kö@@ nig was the basis of the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans will continue to return to the return of the 31 year old .
&quot; at AC Florence under contract standing and on visits were only borro@@ wed Gom@@ ez following the coup , because of the political situation in the country after his EM @-@ holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just must say , &quot; &quot; the journal &quot; &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; &quot; manager of Fi@@ f@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the storms should be ready to refrain from around one third of his to 7.5 million Euros . Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; &quot; his salary in Florence we cannot pay . &quot;
&quot; despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have medals @-@ opportunities at Olympia in Rio , &quot;
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was blocked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le blo@@ wer@@ in Julia vel@@ ano@@ wa must not start in Rio .
others survived athle@@ tics and sinners can only laugh - they fight in Rio to medals .
the theme of D@@ oping continues the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian float in Juli@@ ja J@@ ef@@ im@@ o@@ wa , who had compl@@ ained after a dop@@ ing lock , off the start right before the games , was cut off at their start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it offered itself a sk@@ inn@@ y scenario : with a set sm@@ iles it was still sitting in the hall and prov@@ oked with her appearance .
&quot; as a certain point , that she will not pick up gold , broke the audience into a j@@ ubil@@ ant tower . &quot;
&quot; but there are many more athletes , who go to the start at the Olympic Games in Rio in spite of the dop@@ ing past . &quot;
here an overview :
J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was closed two times because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , it is over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is considered to be the biggest challeng@@ ers of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jamaica ) : the two @-@ time Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ erin and si@@ eben@@ fold World Cup in 2010 had to sit six month @-@ month Sper@@ re after taking the intake of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had a strong tooth that the 29 @-@ year @-@ old was defended . &quot;
Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 the Olympi@@ asi@@ eg@@ cher was tested from 2012 to 2016 in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 to 2016 which was tested by meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 .
Per@@ kovic puts the wi@@ ped intake and was locked for six months .
the four broad@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gol@@ d@@ art .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Beijing Olympics and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested and 21 months were blocked . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement should have been responsible , praying Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is over 200 and 400 m from the world &apos;s fastest growing man in the world . &quot;
&quot; I@@ wan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( Hammer@@ ing , Belarus ) : probably hardly an athle@@ te became so many medals there . &quot;
&quot; thus , Ti@@ ch@@ on lost its World Cup title of 2005 nine years later , after having been found testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympia @-@ silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the also recognized Bron@@ z@@ em@@ ed@@ aille Olympic Games in 2008 , he was given back because of a mem@@ orandum from the International Sport@@ al@@ ry CAS . &quot;
with 80@@ ,@@ 04 m it is located on position two of the world tran@@ p@@ iste !
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world chan@@ cell@@ or and gold @-@ fav@@ ored was first tested in May , but may still be started in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 year old World Championship , references to the intake of a bot@@ any dietary supplement were found , the block@@ re of the world anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency W@@ ada fell off and ran on July 13th . &quot;
Bom@@ b@@ enter@@ ze in Thailand - Austrian film@@ makers in Thailand - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand ranks with the woman in contact , said the speaker of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Fri@@ day@@ early . &quot;
&quot; they have suffered cutting , and be treated in the hospital , but have already abandoned this . &quot;
they planned their home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he also have Austrian citizens , are still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was in constant contact with the local authorities , so car@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , the police have been killed and killed about 20 people , including the Austrian Chamber , three Germans , three Dutch and three Italians . &quot;
&quot; Friday evening then again two explo@@ sives went high , according to the authorities another man was killed . &quot;
there was a bomb of bombs in the morning of Ph@@ u@@ ket .
with the de@@ ton@@ ation near the popular swimming beach Pat@@ ong a taxi driver was injured by police states a taxi driver .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani at the southeast coast of the country , then another bomb , which killed a city of the city . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives was gone out before the re@@ four of the coastal poli@@ cem@@ an in the air . &quot;
&quot; finally , de@@ mar@@ ations were called for Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ om@@ on on the southeast coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; one go from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , called it . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ att@@ ings carry the same manual , &quot; said Army @-@ Major Dan@@ ai said meth@@ av@@ ee Fre@@ ag@@ ee free from journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express itself to possible motives , but probably it is about the actions of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; Thai media also wanted to recognize patterns in the attacks , which is typical for the bom@@ b@@ att@@ un@@ ate separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks are not associated with the Islam@@ ist movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local Sab@@ otage , restricted to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is obvious that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the authorities would have been informed in the last days of secrecy about the standing attacks in the South of the country - however , they don &apos;t have been informed of the exact time and places . &quot;
unclear which group behind the attacks are still unclear .
&quot; the police took their officials throughout the country to enhance security around important government buildings and airports , railway stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and amuse@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand there are always smaller bomb attacks , but mostly they are not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bo@@ l Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; after the nun@@ ci@@ ble bom@@ bers , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs was advised to make the instructions of the Thai security authorities as a result . &quot;
&quot; high safety risk ( security level 3 ) stayed for the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , Patt@@ ani , and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah Vi@@ k and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between security guards and Muslim populations , there is no necessary travel to these provinces . &quot;
higher security risk ( safety level 2 ) for the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum held on a Constitution by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military influence even in the years to come .
&quot; Jun@@ ta @-@ Chief and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Chan @-@ Ch@@ a said the bombs were an attempt to stir chaos , while the country went towards stability , improvement of economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , who had seized power after a phase of bloody crimes , holds itself good to have led the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not succeeded in getting a handle on the military for years in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people were killed in the conflict .
almost one year ago we were killed in Bangkok at a popular Hin@@ du @-@ Sch@@ purely 20 people - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the blu@@ est attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; is in the sight of the Federal Minister for Constitutional protection .
&quot; after several national offices , also the Constitutional Court in the federal government also put the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see at the &apos; identity movement &apos; locking points for efforts against the freedom of democratic basic order , &quot; said Constitutional Court Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ate the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , the im@@ migrant Islamic faith or the Middle East will be diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist fashion . &quot;
that &apos;s why we are seeing the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; identity movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by tran@@ gement . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Con@@ centr@@ alist in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thur@@ in@@ gia - watch the &quot; &quot; identity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups such as the &apos; identity movement &apos; attempt to pick their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Constitutional Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , they attempt to address them with you@@ thful language , often with stu@@ ffed music . &quot;
Islam@@ ists are as well as right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts .
this is not useful advertising for your own cause .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are very vulnerable in a special way .
this is dangerous .
&quot; recently , from several federal states he had given reports about the contacts of the &quot; identity &quot; to Af@@ ales politicians . &quot;
&quot; and Ma@@ ate said , he did not have a knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for constitutional protection , potential contact of this species can only be relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals , the extrem@@ ist , their targets and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such people controlled controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view of the marked increase of legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees said Ma@@ ate , he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but we have noticed in recent years that it can give right @-@ frozen structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Friday group .
&quot; it can be quite sure that further legitimate group@@ ings or small groups form , the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugees or attacks from other far right @-@ right motiv@@ ations . &quot;
a German @-@ wide or European @-@ wide control of law@@ suits is not recognizable .
the previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; concerned , Ma@@ ate expressed that many attacks on the account of men went , which had not appeared before in the right scene . &quot;
this is the worrying .
many of the susp@@ ects in the attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated criminal offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to work with right @-@ wing extremis@@ ts who were perhaps politically in@@ different , or have voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , which then have been radic@@ alised by far @-@ right @-@ wing voting . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes the inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always determine the Olympics or world records the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the brave appearance of RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly obes@@ e s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia is so slow that it was no longer seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the excerpt was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ was then became the viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended with a set@@ back of 48 seconds and took up the 5@@ 9th position of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather its not exactly sports figure , which attracted the attention of the international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year old will participate at the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian was given an extraordinary start by the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in lower countries known .
&quot; since in ae@@ dic@@ s most sports@@ men run , Hab@@ it wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the great race .
quickly the first nickname took the round .
some media reported it as &quot; RO@@ BE@@ L of whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; &quot; well @-@ being &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ lo@@ id &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made it funny . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meter fre@@ isti@@ l , played no part . &quot;
comparisons with &quot; Eric the e@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney there was a run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i for media attention .
unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ atorial Guinea when he had to play in a run over 100 metres of Fre@@ isti@@ l alone .
f@@ rene@@ tically became M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i at that time .
the time 22 @-@ year @-@ old got to swim only eight months before Olympia and had never taken such a long distance before the competition .

G@@ FR@@ P @-@ Gui@@ ding enters after disappointing business speeds
the Consumer Research Centre Gf@@ K exchanged its chief Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ cuts came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company was Gf@@ K , the chair by the Board of Directors Matthias Hart@@ mann will be the more uncertain , the longer the successes have been promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ closing business numbers and the res@@ ignation of the company management stands the global number five of the industry prior to a personalized new start .
G@@ FR@@ P @-@ Managing Director wants to leave the company for the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Arno Me@@ ert , is already presenting its effect on 12 September from the supervisory body . &quot;
&quot; as of September 1 , the leadership in the executive board took over the previous board of Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , distributed the company . &quot;
&quot; he should officially assume the function of a &quot; CEO , &quot; until a successor was found for Hart@@ mann . &quot;

&quot; who will in future be le@@ ased to the market research company , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ otic circles , on Friday , the disappointment was last on Friday for the continued success of the years ahead of a restructuring of years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruit of restructuring is still not to be seen after 5 years , &quot; says it . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business , every shareholder will eventually be rest@@ less . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case at BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; says it . &quot;

six ambul@@ ance cars and an emergency car came to the accident location on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ parall@@ eled travelers were brought back by a regular bus to the Krumlov district Pe@@ ws@@ um .
&quot; there , you should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company . &quot;
the investig@@ ator demanded the truck and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cu@@ bic meters of waste water are from October 1st , 2016 for the division of the se@@ wage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ stake : 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euro ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / L@@ ace 3.@@ 36 Euros ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ ores 3.@@ 64 Euros ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the se@@ wage payment will be increased at the latest once again , if appropriate improvement measures will be necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a over@@ riding calculation , the se@@ wage rates in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4,@@ 37 euro per cu@@ bic feet . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , was noted during the approval of the budget by the Land@@ scape mag@@ mb@@ ach , that for these se@@ wage systems ev@@ oc@@ ations . &quot;
the market Casino is committed to its legal basis due to legal grounds ; to operate the facilities free of charge .
&quot; from October 1st , 2016 , the citizens and the commercial and industrial companies of Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Az@@ endorf , L@@ stop , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg must take deeper into the w@@ allet . &quot;
there are between 48 and 67 percent between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Board of Directors Herbert Schmidt showed the panel , a re@@ kal@@ act of fees for se@@ wage systems of the market was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , Over@@ - respectively sub@@ covers from the previous year period . &quot;
&quot; the gra@@ vi@@ ous ag@@ it@@ ator increases in Schmidt that with all three se@@ wage systems for relatively small facilities with a very small wast@@ e@@ water treatment , which lie between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cu@@ bic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; thus , due to the low distribution of distribution , for example , expenses for the necessary repairs of several thousand Euros would have a grave effect . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the waste water in all three plants is slightly declined . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the past cal@@ care@@ ation period in all three plants , not least due to its age , san@@ itation and repair expendi@@ tures have fallen in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ ore is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ fare , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and L@@ stop@@ over nearly 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt turned out that in the wast@@ e@@ water Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
&quot; in the P@@ ump@@ werk Worldwide positioning , the nearly 20 year old conve@@ ys had to be over@@ hau@@ led due to obsol@@ ete and in the pond @-@ position , after nearly 20 years of operation of the first Kl@@ är@@ pond , it had to be installed and an additional ventil@@ ator can be built in order to continue to comply with the water@@ legal requirements . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; for these extraordinary expenses , the advanced training and maintenance costs came into account in accordance with the new calendar period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 are still significantly below the current level . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made clear that at low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for the operation and maintenance . &quot;
&quot; in fact , added Schmidt , the market community of great entertainment costs in the pre @-@ se@@ wage systems have been spar@@ ed over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the above systems will remain prec@@ arious about stone houses in the long term , as one can not extend the area of the se@@ wage @-@ purpose Fri@@ esen@@ bach Valley in order to extend these plants because it is a deficit of deficit . &quot;
Bulgaria beats up for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
&quot; this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) , and the first on zero since October last year , as a positive 0,@@ 2 % . &quot;
the annual average de@@ flation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.@@ 8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.9 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.@@ 0 % . &quot;
inflation rate from the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was 0.@@ 2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was 0.@@ 2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , the following groups of consumer goods were observed : food and non drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1,8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 1.2 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices fell at clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine expectations ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in case of alcoholic beverages and tobacco , apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat &quot; anim@@ e &quot; Eff@@ ect as Asian caricature critic@@ ises
Sn@@ ap@@ chat said that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired but some observers say that it is uns@@ afe to breeds .
&quot; with its filter tool , Sn@@ ap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that is absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a pine@@ apple , a dog or a figure comprising a matter of Roy Licht@@ enstein . &quot;
&quot; the filters are dil@@ uted , stand@@ ardis@@ ed tools that generate more than 30 million improved sel@@ ectivity per day . &quot;
all the mis@@ steps will come to the public .
sn@@ ap@@ chat filters have drawn criticism in the past critic@@ ised that the app Black@@ face is shaped or white skin as beauty ideal .
&quot; as this week I proposed a filter that gave them sli@@ pped , false teeth and infl@@ ated che@@ eks , there were some critics a rac@@ ist caricature of A@@ sians . &quot;
they asked whether these repeti@@ tive controversi@@ es referred to a larger problem that the company has with diversity .
&quot; the news and the indi@@ gn@@ ation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports of The ver@@ ge and motherboard , a day after sn@@ ap@@ chat , that it would have been sno@@ o@@ zed the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a homage to anim@@ e characters and not as a cartoon by A@@ sians .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , the se@@ is@@ sm experienced , rec@@ alled the filter for vulnerable c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
other declined the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an email wrote Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean American art student whose tent@@ et were widely used over the photos that the filter was hur@@ t@@ ful and eased uncomfortable . &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the counter@@ position of a very conflic@@ ting Asian caricature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ er @-@ sighted , but that the yellow @-@ tail has been pulled into the down@@ ward extre@@ mi@@ m . &quot;
Sn@@ ap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses these cultural pride dra@@ in@@ ers .
&quot; the American culture seems to be involved in an endless dialogue and integration solution , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in your hand . &quot;
and Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats big audience of young people - who are di@@ vers@@ ed in the matter of race than their older ones - could more of them assume sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Sn@@ ap@@ ch@@ ats filters produces a picture that for a user , it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed when it was formerly the case , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year K@@ atie Zh@@ u said in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Zh@@ u decided to work as a product man@@ ag@@ erin and engineer for medium , her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and called for others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a phone interview , she said that she believes that r@@ end@@ ous controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the placement practices in Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
Zh@@ u critici@@ zed the most important part white , only male leaders and ended their sentence with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ ete@@ Sn@@ ap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no various representation of people with other skin colors in their staff , so that they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Zh@@ u , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that are working there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable in order to say anything against it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint , the Sn@@ ap@@ chat largely un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers to diversity of its employees and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , there was sn@@ ap@@ chat , to discuss the cultural background of his associates , but according to a speaker , the company recently focused on a personnel responsible , focused on under@@ represented population groups and internal integration processes . &quot;
Zh@@ u said in turn that she is closed her Sn@@ ap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not OK . &quot;
&quot; military exec@@ uting ISIS intelligence information , represents the Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military organization of the United States Central Command has changed in detail about an optimal picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when they were allowed to have the actual stat@@ ute at a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; preliminary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the dispute , intelligence of intelligence , and the defence budget , reported by great dissatisfaction among Central Command Pro@@ secut@@ ors who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the struggle against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; Central Command , brief C@@ en@@ com , is the military headquarters in Tamp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; news @-@ serving information , typically used by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , signed a more positive image from American efforts against terrorism as being the actual conditions on site and were generally positive as analyses of other news services , &quot; &quot; expressing a newspaper article . &quot;
&quot; what has happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers are suffering when poor analyses of our political leaders are presented , &quot; Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can become a member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the executive gl@@ it@@ ches at Cent@@ Com are up to the top point of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed results in the years of 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi Ar@@ med Forces .
&quot; although there is no direct indications that government pointed under Obama commands to change reports , shows how analysts saw the pressure from their predec@@ essors , an optimal picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as ISIS or Isi@@ l . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command &apos;s press releases , statements and statements on the Congress were clearly more positive than the facts presented , &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com suit was publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s can begin already in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ su@@ l , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so is so clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can congress members from K@@ ans@@ as , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 until the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command have changed the after@@ ward reports to record the danger of ISIS in Iraq . &quot;
the Republi@@ can rie@@ rie@@ ve the Task Force in life after playing them that they were worried regarding manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday is completed by more detailed findings while the investigation continues .
further investigations of Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Defense Department .
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published on Thursday their own findings that coinci@@ des with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 the Cent@@ Com has created a moder@@ ately restricted process for the creation of down@@ grade estim@@ ations to Isi@@ l and the Iraqi security services , a member of the Represent@@ atives of Adam B. vessel , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; hesit@@ ated the publication of subsequent reports , &quot; wor@@ ded the morality under analysts and &quot; gave a little room for different opinions . &quot;
&quot; however , Mr. Shi@@ ps and Democrats agreed to have no evidence on an intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analy@@ st as regards &quot; certain political opinion . &quot; &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of Congress were published on Tuesday by &quot; The Daily Be@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported by investig@@ ations by the General In@@ spec@@ tor of the Pentagon , which were recorded by Cent@@ Com analysts . &quot;
&quot; T. C@@ m@@ dr@@ auf Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ person of the Pentagon , gave in an opinion that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor still be underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also assumed that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions regarding the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Defense Department have a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defense . &quot;
&quot; the investigation has led back@@ effects on the question of a successful aviation campaign , under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by an increasing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) . &quot;
&quot; the question of alleg@@ ations of last year , however , have raised the question to what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the critic@@ isms of the secret information about the Islamic State remind of more than ten years ago , as a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , a writing about how the former government under George W. Bush looked at the recommendations of many analysts only a small cre@@ ws in Iraq and had little time on it , to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 thoughts . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the insurrection against the current coverage of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker to mention government officials , that contrary to the statements of the government held air@@ strikes against the refin@@ eries of the terrorist group , as this provisional refin@@ eries would have taken into operation , to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this realization was not published , the Times in September reported . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , has been critic@@ ised by members of the legis@@ lat@@ ure because of his excessive positive assessment of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin was retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel was replaced .
&quot; the USA won fourth match in the field ho@@ ckey of women , a show@@ down with the UK . &quot;
&quot; one day after they had shot three gates , during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field ho@@ ckey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that American can@@ isters with 3 @-@ 0 won . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a decent performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said , she could not remember it ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I do not belong to people who keep their gates in memory .
&quot; however , this white she knows : the American sisters lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the olymp@@ ic competition , and are equal in their group with Britain on the first place that after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
the United Kingdom and the United States will meet on Saturday at the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already been qualified for the quarter @-@ finals , the game will decide which both of them will gain the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first @-@ placed will take a little longer from the path that the other group will lead .
&quot; as always the game was going on Saturday , the Americans have spark@@ ed their success story an amazing vor@@ tex , four years after they landed at the last London games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
B@@ AM was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a ho@@ ckey sleeping in hands ( her two older sisters played the Sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became a nation &apos;s nation , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympi@@ ad in 2008 , as she could not qualify for the cad@@ res . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which she and her team went wrong .
&quot; in the following year Craig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to contact things for better . &quot;
&quot; a cultural change , a mental change , and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work of work in London that we now have .
we have the Ru@@ der to be fully s@@ nat@@ ch .
on Thursday night B@@ am opened the door@@ step in the first half of the game with a hand@@ shake off the clo@@ se@@ hood .
&quot; India was without victory in the tournament in the game , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and took the playing position from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter when he took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; it led a Sprint with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved into the middle and lu@@ te the ball in the gate to get the American to get a 2 @-@ 0 guided tour . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ zal@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; &quot; Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will hin@@ ge from the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , they are the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are continually feeling , in@@ es@@ capable of , a rapid season between the competition and the pursuit . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic tor@@ ch itself would be a burning stick , which is passed by the wr@@ ist@@ watch for s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tur@@ ers to the tri@@ athle@@ te . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t switch the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in Coff@@ ee@@ shop , without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ v or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female &apos;s warm with di@@ m@@ ples , could have certainly be sent under these known names , built by sponsors and wellbeing TV advertising if he would be a s@@ wimm@@ ers , Tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cer . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights in the olymp@@ ic trampoline for gold . &quot;
the olymp@@ ic flame does not lit any event straight away .
&quot; further from the center , partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air brush , ar@@ chery , b@@ admin@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the fli@@ pper and may have dom@@ inion for a long time .
&quot; but if I &apos;d make modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet char@@ me of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has already been a olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had his debut in Sydney , the last 16 years had been so spar@@ se that many that I asked , did not know that it is at all a Olympi@@ as@@ port@@ art . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes for competition , it has never won a coin on a trampoline and had an athle@@ te until 2012 , which it has made up to the final . &quot;
the Chinese and Russians tend to share their prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadian ans for women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on a trampoline has a certain out@@ sider char@@ me , partly because it sounds appropriate for the un@@ resolved ear for a clo@@ wn school than those for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point I should admit that I am not an expert , but only a sublime enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has hum@@ orous potential - the kar@@ to@@ on@@ ous tre@@ mb@@ ling of his never to end clou@@ dy - but also the Grazie of the athle@@ tic and diving , the two sports that is essentially united . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El trampoline , which means as much as &quot; spr@@ ing@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winner jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( rotating , lifting and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympics , they are evaluated according to the execution , difficulty of difficulty and &quot; &quot; flight time &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; two @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , are in Rio to compete against each other . &quot;
the common Olympic vector is straight on straight .
&quot; med@@ all@@ ists hoped in their quest for gold , faster , upwards and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and back , upwards and down@@ wards on the playground . &quot;
&quot; it is not only the ornam@@ ental or cur@@ b , but also a further height in the TV transfer : that of the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the target @-@ oriented quest is no@@ bel , admir@@ able , even fan@@ ati@@ cal - and it &apos;s enough to even stir a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I don &apos;t have to look at the look of these games as something .
this trampoline offers a re@@ pri@@ eve .
the vector of the trampoline is above .
a for@@ wards movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she j@@ umped off , apparently wei@@ ght@@ less as an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effortlessly back upwards . &quot;
&quot; here , there is a competition , of course , not without difficulty , but during exercise , there is no h@@ ectic attack on the target , no arch@@ ing in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it can be as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games .
&quot; the qualification and En@@ dr@@ ons of women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the Streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; most of the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will shine as part of a night block at both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely overlooked in general turmoil . &quot;
if the awareness increase only through the anxiety and the lens of male athletes can be reached - as it suggested the male U.S. Tur@@ ner according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his after air rin@@ ses , new fans . &quot;
&quot; a generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long a ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators demanded that political changes in Ethiopia call on violent resistance from the government .
witnesses say that zig prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police officers .
is Ethiopia going to be together ?
&quot; during the last ten years , one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid fo@@ e of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
but in the last months protests against the government the country and they spread to more and more areas .
last week thousands of people flooded into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
the government &apos;s response was un@@ mer@@ ciful to human rights organisations .
witnesses gave to that police officers were killed on un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators and killed .
&quot; changing videos about the protests that probably are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how safety men have young people with st@@ aves , while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the leader of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for an out@@ going investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold up this country and in the future it will be even harder , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa to Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiop@@ ian economy was expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new com@@ mu@@ le in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; if Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations , constantly led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , with dissi@@ dents effective to sil@@ enced . &quot;
many were sent into exile or imprisoned in exile or carried out in the wilderness of the desert .
but that could change .
&quot; if you press people and these no other options have to protest besides , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiop@@ ian . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
a generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground @-@ use to the wor@@ ms with respect to the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition , and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the tensions along the border to Eritrea is rising ; a fight for this jag@@ ged , controversial primarily demanded in June hundreds of lives . &quot;
&quot; analytics fear fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the Oro@@ mo @-@ Liber@@ ation Front or the National Liber@@ ation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , which have been more or less imposed in recent years , which could exploit turbul@@ ence and armed again . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of pro@@ vocation after years of going ahead of self @-@ energi@@ zed under the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first one seems harmless : smart phones .
&quot; only in recent years , very many Ethiop@@ ians had been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services . &quot;
&quot; even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter , what they do at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies who conce@@ al where they are staying . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians gave them their protests to protect themselves .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest eth@@ ni@@ cities in Ethiopia . &quot;
the Oro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons prosp@@ eri@@ zed the Am@@ har@@ as , which come from Ethiopia , predominantly Christian high@@ lands , in politics and economics , while they exploit the Oro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in flat @-@ areas . &quot;
but this also changes .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a screen , &quot; &quot; Mul@@ at@@ u Gem@@ ech@@ u said , a leader of the Oro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests were held in areas of the Am@@ hara and Oro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and Oro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which constitute around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military , in the intelligence agencies , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the unrest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former re@@ bel leader , was until his death at a non @-@ publi@@ ci@@ zed disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiop@@ ian prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
analysts are saying that he was particularly well vers@@ ed in using early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to process enemies and make them in@@ harmful .
&quot; the current regime is lacking in this fundamental step , &quot; Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new prime minister , Hai@@ le@@ maritime am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively un@@ attended reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray Region of the north of Ethiop@@ ian , lord of Haiti is coming from the south . &quot;
analy@@ st must say that he enjoys not the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tig@@ ray control services .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time , Ethiopia was in such a turmoil in 2005 , after thousands of elections had been prot@@ ested by the government , according to the data of Analy@@ tik@@ ders , apparently stolen by the government and were stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following raid , many prot@@ esting were killed even if it were less than in the last months , and this time of unrest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts of Ethiop@@ ian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning , such as the new pend@@ ul@@ um line , as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal abnorm@@ alities of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esting in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ ani city , of Tig@@ ray guided shops and the hatred towards the tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analy@@ st tell that the protests brought the U.S. and other western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even if it recently claimed that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his allies in an already volati@@ le area collap@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin Gr@@ at@@ cher . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim Obama promised ISIS &apos; sar@@ cas@@ m .
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump tried to dissi@@ p@@ ate the last controversy on Friday that surrounds his campaign , President Obama and Hill@@ ary Clinton would have been meant the &quot; founder &quot; of the Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fying clari@@ fying new questions on the communication skills of the Presidential candidates of the Republi@@ can Committee whether he would be able to communicate with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his collaborators , who make an effort to take him during an event@@ ful phase in protection to explain in the peculiar position , statements that he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; after he had made the hint at a voting event on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump made in relation to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday said Mr. Tr@@ ump , he was just sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation entirely seriously . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help remove the statement somewhat mi@@ tig@@ ate the statement by asking him to destroy it , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of the critique was bla@@ ze down to Mr. Tr@@ ump . while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of random frac@@ ture on the economic situation .
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton talked about speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried again to return to this topic . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clin@@ on &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said , the Russians were supposed to cho@@ p Mrs. Clin@@ t &apos;s emails , but later he said , &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ cas@@ tically . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to move the language boundaries in politics and then back to ruin .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans , as they arrive , and then if necessary &quot; clarify &quot; according to how the reaction goes . &quot; &quot; Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; however , I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements v@@ ague enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of putting the tone to the presidential elections , Mr. Tr@@ ump has assumed more than its tone , since its survey values are further declined . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a lead with great lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ on @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump in general seeks to apologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often accused his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or to understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he is strengthening the attention of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ umps Scher@@ ze have brought his loyal co @-@ sh@@ on@@ ites into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Giuli@@ ani , former Mayor of New York and one of the most famous tra@@ int builders , gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says is legitimate , political comments , so he said Mr. Giuli@@ ani was asking him to the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ umps &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called her back @-@ back@@ ers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government was served under Obama , in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor Minister , it was allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election events in Pennsylvania , Mr. Tr@@ ump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before them to ride on any of his words and be taken against him . &quot;
&quot; he appreci@@ ates the &quot; poor , j@@ aun@@ t &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; They can not ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
some of the democrats have found Mr. Tr@@ umps ap@@ ology as only a further proof that he is un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once passed on the price of the market , Café is returned in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a s@@ worn café in Williamsburg , where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from its Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ Front has been displaced . &quot;
&quot; the shop So@@ ap Ch@@ erie , bought the ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sold soap in the form of C@@ up@@ cakes . &quot;
&quot; indigenous people , as the last loss in a balanced city . &quot;
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cr@@ ab@@ ief wrote on Twitter , &quot; &quot; I know , New York is change , but I can still not believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but if new York change is , then it is a re @-@ finding . &quot;
a revit@@ alised ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new Ver@@ b has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is also always good .
&quot; the new owner of the Ver@@ b is Cisco Rodri@@ guez , a long @-@ standing member of the old cafes , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working in 2001 at Ver@@ b and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when he offered him a customer to provide money for a new out@@ post , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ guez , 36 , maintained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for the bag@@ els bought the same es@@ pres@@ so machine .
it even uses the same lamps from the old Ver@@ b .
but Rodri@@ guez said that he also wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu is sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are clo@@ ckers like chap@@ els and acid oni@@ ons .
there are natural herbs .
&quot; the cafe does not serve beer anymore , there are fresh juice . &quot;
&quot; after nine months Rodri@@ guez said Rodri@@ guez , that he had noticed a strong stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also delivered through prizes of Williamsburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
recently on a Sunday Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira such a customer .
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , staying earlier in Williamsburg and visited the Ver@@ b regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she was drawn to Green@@ point , she would take the way up . &quot;
&quot; once the ver@@ b had closed , she gave a while the coffee leg , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the ver@@ b which fell to me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she has again coffee , even though she ordered this day instead of her usual I@@ ced Coff@@ ee@@ able Cha@@ i Tea , who is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal became another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and ordered in@@ vari@@ ably the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; photo Rodri@@ guez said , he wanted to experiment and raise new ingredients into the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays , Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ guez said that he won &apos;t have a Gro@@ w over that that the soap business has taken the old business area .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Ch@@ erie offered a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold breakfast coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; said Rodri@@ guez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish people Green@@ points have accepted the cafe as well . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu to the Polish and Rodri@@ guez , saying that he pre@@ tend to expose her soon so that his new neighbors will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other benefits .
an authentic ju@@ t@@ bar wants to fill the cold coffee in bottles and sell .
there is a chance that the café is expanded to a nearby building .
&quot; for many customers , a new ver@@ b is sufficient to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was tribal and said that he was destroyed on the ground than the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that the bed of the loc@@ als and the bri@@ bes felt a new coffee like a home@@ coming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell that , &quot; he said . &quot;
the depres@@ sing food of the economic crisis in &quot; an abundant meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his climb to the President , Franklin Del@@ ano Roo@@ sev@@ elt his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as gour@@ mets , President Roo@@ sev@@ elt had a f@@ ai@@ ble for refined delicacies , Fifth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie grass and Maryland water turtles . &quot;
&quot; his menu on this day was slightly modest : filled eggs in Tom@@ at@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , potato pu@@ ree and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans as they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights . they are both food histori@@ ography .
&quot; Co@@ es last book &quot; Cho@@ p Su@@ ey &quot; was inspired by the Chinese cuisine in the USA , during Zi@@ egel@@ man in her book &quot; &quot; 97 Or@@ chard &quot; &quot; about life in a residential home on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their newest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in Eisen@@ berg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , schn@@ au@@ dal snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the 2008 Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh che@@ es@@ and@@ wich with olive sc@@ rap , while Co@@ e , 57 , Tru@@ th@@ ahn with potato pu@@ ree and vegetables @-@ mixture . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter dul@@ c@@ ates ordered , this took the couple for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich food were very popular , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut , liver cheese and bean bro@@ t . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and some che@@ ap@@ ly prepared by the ingredient .
imagine so many pe@@ an@@ uts to eat that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ e sm@@ ir@@ ked .
&quot; it has to have placed in the stomach such as lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years ahead of Great Depression , the table was in an American household , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
cre@@ ws of women co@@ ded for male fiel@@ d@@ work and it was served fresh baked pasta for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to a hungry Europeans during the first World War . &quot; &quot; a Square &quot; &quot; marks the paths that the country went on with it , no longer the s@@ lar@@ land land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for the Americans was a central , tense issue , &quot; &quot; watched co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; as tense was the new bud@@ get@@ fulness : mysterious foods such as bre@@ ads and cas@@ sette became a stap@@ le food , the cas@@ ser@@ ative as a &quot; wonderful way , &quot; eating more reliable , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man because cooks of un@@ appe@@ tizing ingredients could hide under a mu@@ ddy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruits was replaced by cheap drying ob@@ st .
&quot; meat , which was for years the center of American cuisine , became a rare and fourth luxury . &quot;
&quot; peculiar compounds have been tried , since a cal@@ orie rich and nour@@ ishing grati@@ fication may take preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy cooking . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book that includes recipes , prepared ornam@@ ents a dish from this epoch , baked oni@@ ons with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular add on the mid@@ day , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man continues his way : &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked oni@@ ons fit not fit to each other .
it was typical for many of the home@@ work recipes .
&quot; as never before or since then , household economic relations - including Louise Stan@@ ley , chief of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - the food habits of the country . &quot;
&quot; in providing recipes and articles published in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; household people &quot; &quot; and to transform the challenge , Pamp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; a Square &quot; &quot; is a feast of historical ti@@ d@@ bits . &quot;
&quot; in particular , reports on the response of the government to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ vers L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ Essen . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple Iowa farm cuisine of his kitchen , he spe@@ ar like the million @-@ heavy man of the world to which he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with Gur@@ k@@ ens@@ au@@ ce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost tw@@ ater dining room and carried a smo@@ king .
he was del@@ ici@@ ously re@@ plen@@ ished .
&quot; President Roo@@ sev@@ elt perhaps made the same mistake , if not his wife was Ele@@ an@@ or prompted him to establish a stamp on his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the beginning of a house@@ keeper with no interest in tastes by Mrs. Roo@@ sev@@ elt said that the White House brought forth the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most ble@@ ached food . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , with food to deal was rejected as soon as the land came back to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the Leg@@ acy is on our continued focus on calories and food , said Zi@@ egel@@ man , as well as science on food . &quot;
the couple gave better understood in the book of the book the eating habits of Zi@@ egel@@ man in law - for example how they could not throw away food .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
Zi@@ egel@@ man remembered : &quot; she actually made people ill .
there was the wind@@ ling incident .
&quot; after the plates were ev@@ acu@@ ated at Eisen@@ berg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e drew a dessert that they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um &apos; , the President Roo@@ sev@@ elt at lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; said Zi@@ egel@@ man and added that it was a nasty trick to send a name to those recipes . &quot;
&quot; there was no s@@ inu@@ ous cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
everyone sw@@ ed something reluc@@ t@@ antly to have a spo@@ on in the fence , brown @-@ b@@ ber . &quot;
surprisingly there was not bad .
Co@@ e won three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ zer , he said to his wife , &quot; A few ch@@ opped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bombs : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed Omar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed Omar took his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died at a capacity attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; Omar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets &quot; ( White Helm@@ ets &quot; , &quot; a civil rights group , which has saved the lives according to the Picture @-@ Newspaper . &quot;
&quot; 2@@ 900 Volun@@ te@@ ers put their own life to play , to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to make their first aid in the war . &quot;
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
Omar was the face of the group : a video of the civil war that shows him with a 11 @-@ hour rescue of a infants out of the ruins of a house , went in 2014 around the world . &quot;
it made the Syrians on the shining symbol@@ ism in the Gre@@ ys of the war .
&quot; but as a hero he never seen himself , said loud picture : &quot; &quot; for me this is the true Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die , save life , I think that God sees me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before Omar was attacking the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bomb attacks in Syria . &quot;
the Heli@@ kop@@ ter have thrown four fac@@ bom@@ bers over the Alzheimer &apos;s district which was filled with chlor@@ gas .
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breathing difficulty . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the poison@@ ous remn@@ ants of the bomb , so that not children play with it , the image quoted his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bombs of the Assad regime had to meet terrorists .
Grön@@ land shar@@ k : the oldest cycl@@ one is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Grön@@ land@@ sh@@ arks usually only appear in the winter to the surface .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and swi@@ ms with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today .
Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie got only with 150 years of offspring .
&quot; leis@@ urely crossing the Greenland shar@@ k at the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.@@ 220 meters . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meters long animal speeds up to 2,@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a ro@@ b with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; however , this of a long @-@ term lifestyle seems to be a silver bul@@ let for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on &quot; &quot; Science &quot; &quot; at any rate from a Greenland shar@@ k that could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; said Alexander Sch@@ eu@@ than@@ lein from the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means for vert@@ ebr@@ ates a world record . &quot;
&quot; admittedly , the evolution of evolution has long been that Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie is st@@ ony . &quot;
only missing the evidence .
&quot; Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the polar sea before the sk@@ inn@@ ed coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and Spit@@ s@@ bergen . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius , they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter . &quot;
&quot; however , about the lifestyle of Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie knowledge researchers have little knowledge . &quot;
&quot; their contem@@ por@@ ation measures them , when they calculated six animals with a transmitter . &quot;
&quot; loot make this sh@@ arks nevertheless : in the stomach of an animal found researchers the remains of a ro@@ be , a different had swal@@ lowed the j@@ aw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly hunt them sleeping animals or pat@@ rolled at the bottom of the ice cream and look car@@ c@@ asses who tor@@ ches from higher water layers down@@ stairs .
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie , the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as a con@@ vent from the depth of the North Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimeters long , while the biggest 50@@ 2 cen@@ tim@@ etres . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they reviewed with the carbon @-@ 14 method of the sh@@ arks of the sh@@ arks . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens starts already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had stri@@ k@@ ingly much carbon @-@ 14 in the lin@@ sen@@ ders .
&quot; therefore , their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s , as nuclear weapons en@@ cap@@ tive greater quantities of this radio@@ active carbon carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length , the lens has opposed a low surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is likely to have celebrated his 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
all the larger Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their Lin@@ sen@@ ders against the normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere .
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 @-@ clock features a 4@@ 93 centimeters long Greenland shar@@ k an age of 3@@ 35 years , during the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimeters , even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k female only got up , if they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers could assign a age to age .
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 cen@@ tim@@ etres probably passed on the threshold to the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined , Grön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously weighs at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this should also be the case for vert@@ ebr@@ ates at this time world @-@ cl@@ ord .
that such meth@@ us@@ al@@ eme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; also the previous record holder , a 211 year old Greenland @-@ whale , in whose sp@@ eck at the neck a 120 years old Har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism also runs on austerity . &quot;
so they mature later - and then slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often particularly large . &quot;
&quot; because volume grows faster than its surface , by which the animal is heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram is therefore much bigger than with a grams of elephant .
another advantage : you have less enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as early as possible as possible as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolution of evolution . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , a very large animal should invest more in a long life on the other hand . &quot;
construction site in a double pack
&quot; with topics around the building , the community at the latest meeting has focused on this issue . &quot;
&quot; with the relief the committee took the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of recent @-@ proven residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the basics , Par@@ cel@@ ess and Re@@ alization questions and the applications for measurement have been clarified , the sale of the plots in the residential zones &quot; &quot; road@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - construction section 1 ) is nothing more in the way . &quot;
the council is convinced that the tap@@ es in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au young families and touching seniors equally appeal .
as it meant we can report building wil@@ der immediately in the Town Hall about the allocation of the par@@ c@@ els will be advised in its September meeting .
&quot; to also change requests to the relocation of other commercial enterprises , combined with the creation of jobs , the constitu@@ ent , decided to change the area used in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; thus , in the range of sub@@ seasons , the industrial sector will be expanded there by two plots towards state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ xit
&quot; the city on the Main has therefore reached the best opportunities to move from London , Dublin and Luxembourg in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is most likely that Frankfurt am benef@@ iting most of the Bre@@ xit vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the competence fel@@ ine markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ xit referendum , it is uncertain whether the money will continue to operate from London and financial transactions within the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , the approval in the UK is for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
these are just major US banks .
several banks have already announced jobs to shift .
&quot; the lob@@ by@@ ists &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; counts with 10000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , speak the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight over the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other key authorities such as the European Insurance Group E@@ IO@@ PA and the Risk Management of ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has opened its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the denom@@ ination is important for banks , as they can communicate directly to the over@@ sight , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg home a large fund industry , cuts off as well as Dublin in the infrastructure . &quot;
Frankfurt is easy to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city with easily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
the Seine are also the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial properties by 50 percent higher than on the Main .
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers greater quality of life than competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ran@@ kings of the company consulting Mer@@ cer lead the city to No.@@ 7 , Dublin to No.@@ 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if a quality of life is a question of preferences : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European Single Market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors &quot; , &quot; the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; London , however , in spite of Bre@@ xit &apos;s most important financial hub in Europe will remain , my economic researchers . &quot;
&quot; for this we also speak the correlation of forces : in London , in accordance with figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba in the end of 2015 around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking sector , in Frankfurt there were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead receives legal costs in the hepatitis C patent @-@ dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. office decided that Gilead &apos;s Sciences are entitled to the refund of the legal costs that you have ar@@ isen from the Hep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June , Gilead was freed from a damages in the amount of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , who stood in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster @-@ medication So@@ val@@ di and Harv@@ oni of Gilead , after a U.S. judge as@@ po@@ unded a pattern of mis@@ behavior by Mer@@ cks , including Mein@@ l and other uni@@ on@@ eth@@ ic actions . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday the law@@ suit on Thursday was told us in his Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman , that Gilead is entitled to vom@@ iting the cost , which have ar@@ isen during the defence of the case . &quot;
Mer@@ ck tries to neutr@@ alise Gilead that dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines that can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease .
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck compl@@ ained each other and claim their property on laboratory work , the Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir cav@@ el@@ ag , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;

&quot; they have released over 2,000 civilians who were held from the fighters as ho@@ stages , shared Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish , with the D@@ KS feder@@ ated Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Re@@ uters . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we just run up space through , &quot; he told Re@@ uters . &quot;
Clin@@ ics deserve 10,@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal control
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton announced their tax statement for 2015 on Friday , which revealed for the presidential and her husband a income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective Bundes@@ tax rate of 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clin@@ ton USD 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation , the former President Bill Clinton had posted an income of USD 3 million from the Verlag Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for their book on their term in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ t &apos;s candidate to vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , published along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , his tax explained the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; Hill@@ ary Clinton and Tim Ka@@ ine still continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clin@@ ics Kamp@@ ag@@ ar hel@@ pers gave Jennifer Pal@@ mi@@ eri in an opinion . &quot;
in a cr@@ ater in contrast , Donald Tr@@ ump hiding behind incorrect expression and pull @-@ out with regard to his previous promises to publish his tax explained . &quot;
it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax explained although they are not obliged by law to do so .
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have specified a tax check by the tax authorities as a reason for his denial . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clin@@ ics &apos;s electoral campaign in Ian Sam@@ s on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the Presidential candidate . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Michael C@@ oh@@ en , Tr@@ umps special advis@@ ors , to CN@@ N , that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to publish something before the tax inspections are not finished . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps critics , among other things also the Republi@@ can presidential candidate at the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already completed sil@@ ently that his ref@@ usal questions in terms of wealth , his gifts for charitable organisations , its divisions and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown on the subject and published a video on the Internet on Friday , in the high @-@ ranking Re@@ public@@ ans Tr@@ ump call for his tax statement . &quot;
on Thursday she spoke also during a speech on the economy of Michigan .
he ref@@ uses to do what every other candidate has done in recent decades and to publish its tax explained . &quot; she said to the crowd .
&quot; pol@@ tico reported that Tr@@ ump in the 1990s did not pay any or only very little taxes , and an economic journalist in the New York Times cited a number of tax attorney and tax advis@@ ers that may still be the case . &quot;
Federal control have become a topic in the election campaign .
&quot; Clinton provides a scheme named after the billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , who would ensure that individuals receive more than USD 1 million for a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama supports the proposal also .
&quot; during a election campaign for Hill@@ ary Clinton in the past week in O@@ maha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industri@@ et@@ ate has his seat here , Tr@@ ump into a meeting to exchange their control . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to an accoun@@ tant @-@ examination of the IR@@ S and Tr@@ ump have &quot; fear &quot; in front of the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clin@@ &apos;s campaign had a tax statement from all coming up to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ ics , now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid by an effective state tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.@@ 5 % . &quot;
&quot; the Klinik &apos;s tax policy showed that these only USD 100 of its income as wage , unlike most of all Americans . &quot;
&quot; its main money was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clin@@ ics dividen@@ ds and yields of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were hidden . &quot;

condoms with chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der , fire@@ places to promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
&quot; conserv@@ ation@@ ist in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from being inhabited , in people inhabited settlements - they throw condoms on them that are filled with chi@@ cks . &quot;
the method has proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation which had already trained the idea for years along with the US nature conservation efforts to promote their funding in villages in northern Tanz@@ ani@@ as to use a non@@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their houses and crops without sacrific@@ ing animals .
&quot; before , many Spe@@ akers have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is a phone call dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... tool@@ kit , we were able to observe inside these communities a change of their attitudes while keeping the eleph@@ ants from their fields without damaging the eleph@@ ants , expressed himself the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Damian Bell in a communication . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a tor@@ ch and bub@@ bles into a horn .
&quot; if he is not scar@@ ed , a so @-@ called &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; Chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der pur@@ ée with earth is wrapped together with a fire@@ works , wrapped up into a con@@ dom whose end up to the ig@@ ni@@ tion is rot@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom shines with a tu@@ b@@ ang and spra@@ yed fine dust to chi@@ li@@ pu@@ der in the air . &quot;
a touch quite usually already out to chase the elephant .
&quot; a last possibility is a making , who sho@@ ots a gold fire@@ work in the air and caused a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
Stadt@@ tram@@ pled unanimously : no ki@@ osk on the St. Go@@ ar Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; usually , the St. Go@@ al &apos;s investment project of tra@@ des@@ ks with Kus@@ ad@@ and - is still regarded as a significant increase in retail companies in the core city . &quot;
&quot; the application for the new construction of a sales team at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , in the immediate vicinity of the R@@ hen@@ ch@@ on , the outskirts of the city was now exhausted . &quot;
&quot; basically we welcome new tra@@ des@@ men , but at this location in exposed position on the Rhein@@ u@@ fer , this ki@@ osk does not turn away , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
Jewish director crum@@ bs Berlin hotel because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; Arabian &quot; invitation - RT News
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after he had betrayed the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin has not listed any Israeli pres@@ election as it requested Arab guests according to an employee .
&quot; Claude Lan@@ z@@ mann , author of the Holocaust @-@ documentary &quot; &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; &quot; had his ag@@ gra@@ vation in the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Bristol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last visit Lan@@ z@@ mann tried to find Israel on the site list of the hotel .
&quot; however , the country was not listed between the countries which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lan@@ z@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i Bristol provides an opportunity to choose Israel about its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after a statement , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; ched it &quot; , &quot; as Lan@@ z@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel stated that the measure is a &quot; clear decision by the management of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
&quot; the reason behind it was , destroyed in the director , even more anger . &quot;
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs , and they demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , the staff of Lan@@ z@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ ze @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; great shame , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and over@@ thrown by this event .
this is really very embarrassing .
&quot; the fact that this in Germany has grown in precisely this hotel chain , is even a even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require a declaration .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a fairly large resonance in the internet , in which people called the whole a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some sub@@ ordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel that there could have been the alleged &quot; &quot; Arab guests &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ashamed you , &quot; &quot; was it in another post , in which it was noted that the hotel , which is located at the most pos@@ h Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , near a Synago@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly pointed out all alleg@@ ations of himself and called the incident of an &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; apologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lan@@ z@@ mann , reports The mirror . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct statement , &quot; Israel does not enter into the quick@@ w@@ list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung writes a speaker of the Kemp@@ in@@ ski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the di@@ aling code has been added now .
police sets Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber @-@ fin against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students went together on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo with the police when they were gathered to demonstrate against the reforms of the government for the public education system .
the police put Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and rubber @-@ fin against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as a police officers , who tried to deal with students , which resulted in the police of rubber bul@@ lets and lac@@ ri@@ eng@@ as . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation over the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Govern@@ ors of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ .000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants saw gra@@ ff@@ i@@ ti@@ ts against the provisional President of Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
the recent protests occurred several days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President D@@ il@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff that was ab@@ rog@@ ated by a vote of the Senate .
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT business
&quot; the lifting of the sanctions grew according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the turnover of trade between Moscow and Teheran in the year comparison by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions imposed on Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in shops in the country , shared the amb@@ ass@@ adors . &quot;
Russian companies have existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , the further merchant distribution is one of the greatest priorities of the bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan &quot; . &quot; &quot;
he noted that the turnover of the turnover between Russia and Iran in the first five months of the year 2016 rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent compared to the same period in 2015 and was $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , the Russian imports rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amoun@@ ted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 15@@ 8 million .
&quot; the merchant &apos;s recovery was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the Ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia for this year .
&quot; last year the Russian Foreign Minister gave roughly 3@@ 5.000 Vis@@ as , primarily of Reis@@ ev@@ is@@ as , an Iranian citizen . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries , which affects the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; you could say that the record numbers of tourists in Russia will be broken from the last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes that it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ raz and Y@@ az@@ d , who received monuments of ancient civilization in good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the perpetrators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters in size , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible from the parking level of the RE@@ WE market and poorly visible .
&quot; the perpetrators need to be sc@@ anned out towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert &apos;s path and escaped from opposite to the parking place of dirt road with the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards B 256 ( impact ) . &quot;
&quot; who has made observations for the time ( against 7.@@ 45 p.m. ) observations , which are in connection with the rob@@ bery @-@ incident , should be urgently present with the police . &quot;

Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : Pil@@ gri@@ ms to the gate of mercy
the min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts from the past@@ oral @-@ past@@ oral unit of St. Anna were on the road at a four @-@ day pilgrimage of Vill@@ ingen to Freiburg .
four stages have been tackl@@ ed .
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next rum@@ mage of all min@@ is@@ tran@@ ts in the past two years , the upper @-@ wing round St. Anna has chosen to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several tre@@ ach@@ ograph@@ s were tested and it was finally decided on the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al city of Freiburg , where he was offered a special pilgrimage to this year during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from Bitt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ol , Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Heiligen@@ stadt rose on the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims at a small ceremony in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ ms and divided the Pil@@ gri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b , by train to the starting point of Vill@@ ingen , where also an Münster was im@@ ser@@ er &apos;s loved woman , and so the pilgrimage path was raised from the Münster . &quot;
&quot; the individual Tag@@ est@@ our@@ en were shot in the morning and evening depending on a short impulse with different prayers , songs and ty@@ rant . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way the min@@ is on field cross , chap@@ els or churches always went back to sing together a song from odd pilgrims &quot; pilgrims &quot; to sing together . &quot;
for the nights the cl@@ ub@@ house of the local parish were available .
&quot; at the Et@@ ch@@ equ@@ est@@ rian Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller for a delicious and increased dinner and breakfast . &quot;
the second day went through Fur@@ tw@@ ave to Gü@@ ten@@ bach .
&quot; tags on that one went to St. Peter &apos;s leg , which was the exhau@@ sting trail , but at first they had to climbed around 500 metres of altitude and then be heard again . &quot;
the missed reward was a common gri@@ lling at the beach in the evening .
&quot; after the dawn on the fourth pilgrimage day in the imposing monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the Schl@@ us@@ set@@ book to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the later afternoon at the Frei@@ burg Münster , and through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse it was thanks to God .
&quot; in the evening mass in the Münster , the most at the pilgrimage is welcomed by Ko@@ operator Mark O@@ bert . &quot;
after the divine service the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ r@@ isty and the altar of altar .
the next day was still time for the Bre@@ is@@ gau@@ metrop@@ ole .
afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agree that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold for cycling .
Scotland &apos;s call for Sk@@ inner ra@@ dies@@ t last night in the V@@ alt@@ z Sprint in Rio to glory but the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the c@@ il@@ role played by his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y . the young prof@@ ar and made the legend prou@@ dly than he was stor@@ med home to take a victory from the favour@@ ites New Zealand .
England claimed four years ago a shocking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympi@@ as medals .
she reiter@@ ated the trick after taking her in March at the railways Championship in London despite the Return Ho@@ ys only a modest sixth place .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver &apos;s Jamie Staff .
they did so in time as a execution .
Ho@@ ys reti@@ res generated a gap , the K@@ ian E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cr@@ amp@@ ton tried to close . &quot;
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw the potential in the car@@ rots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y triumph@@ s - and Sk@@ inner sat down a Olympic ch@@ ord in the qualifying round , but in the still@@ s the New Zealand were victorious . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ der was short back after his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team to the front and Sk@@ inner stopped . &quot;
&quot; a strategic change made a large part of the transformation , when exec@@ uting a higher gear in order to dec@@ eler@@ ate it and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and fell to Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ du , when this came on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ atter@@ ing comparison . &quot;
I am only here to do my best and make a name for me .
we have placed a Olympi@@ ar@@ ek@@ ord in the final class and the world champion is defeated .
it was simply unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph of 2012 on the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , gave me that he went straight to the train after a weak start . &quot;
he returned this statement later and there was no objection of England Riv@@ ne .
with such a super@@ lative victory this time there was no such problem .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; it feels like London &apos;s whole GB on the Tri@@ bun@@ es , like London . &quot;
we came together as a team in the last three months .
we have come so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to re@@ win back at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event that won Gold Med@@ al for the Nation , seven of 10 titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months , we expect successful five days at Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form characteristic , it is in the area of Pos@@ sible that he repeated Ho@@ ys victory of three olymp@@ ic gold medals in a contest . &quot;
&quot; that would be born for Kenn@@ y - the exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on 23 March ( an apparently holy date for British sports ; on the day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger B@@ ann@@ ister were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
the Che@@ ese of the yo@@ y equal .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the spr@@ int that begins today and will go over three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; &quot; I enjoy this only for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels something to gain alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two other gold medals , he should be be@@ aten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only med@@ all@@ ists contest of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly Wig@@ gins , Ed Clan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ w@@ ain Dou@@ ll qualified himself with the fastest performance in the vi@@ zer @-@ four @-@ o@@ dom@@ eter race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 9@@ 42 . &quot;
&quot; the world record , which was won in London in 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will be held today on the second day of competition , while Wig@@ gins will focus on safety in focus . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had disputed yesterday with prayer in front of the qualification , as the function@@ aries called for itself to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition that will continue tomorrow and ended , av@@ anced Laura S@@ hand , Jo@@ anna Ro@@ w@@ sell S@@ hand , E@@ lin@@ or Bark@@ er and K@@ atie Archi@@ soon of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ av@@ ie in time in 4 : 13.@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team is leaving its strong train to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to catch a sc@@ ar of medals for the Olympic Games .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio have been driven . &quot;
&quot; drama &apos;s drama in the background , thus the res@@ ignation of the Sh@@ ane Sut@@ ton res@@ igned in April , in the middle of sex@@ ism and har@@ ass@@ as and the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ leton . &quot;
&quot; however , if one sees itself the first evening of the competition in Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the legendary call GB@@ s that has reached its peak for a perfect moment . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy market
&quot; the future of the aluminum melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of jobs of workers - are at stake , as the system operator will terminate the energy supply contract and thus lift all delivery orders , as the supplier @-@ requ@@ esting energy companies . &quot;
&quot; this step was followed by the decision of the government at Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies for operation of the plant . &quot;
a payout percentage of 20 years later is scheduled in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the facility of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 workplaces have direct and indirect - could be endangered at a time closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects because the melting pot around 10 per cent of total electricity generation is consumed . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa was closed the Point Henry Sch@@ mel@@ ed , which led last year to close the Angl@@ es@@ ea power station . &quot;
the melting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and is risky .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation over the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminum melting together with its Lo@@ y Yang A power station in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , shared with that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the complex is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , where Chinese companies CI@@ TIC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p are holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant is operated in Port@@ land , which means more physical demand for electricity through the melting system , shared the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L said , &quot; &quot; AG@@ L said , &quot; &quot; that the contracts called &quot; &quot; wash@@ ers &quot; &quot; should have been in force from November 2016 . &quot;
contracts have a 12 month period of notice that they will end 2017 .
&quot; from this reason , AG@@ L is assuming that the contracts will contribute to the revenue in the fiscal year 17 , &quot; &quot; said the power supplier . &quot;
&quot; all potential impacts on the revenues at AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by the forecasts of the strong schedule markets for wholesale prices . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L shared with that it has already written the value of contracts in his annual crash into the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melting or the power supply to the melting together &quot; do not com@@ promised . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Yang , who would have to come into force this year , even if there is still a statement , why it came from the contract . &quot;
analy@@ st warn of the bad economic relations of the industry before the possible closure of the Port@@ land Sch@@ mel@@ zer@@ ei in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near Newcastle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of the analy@@ st at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land employs some 600 mega@@ watts , and Tom@@ ago around 900 mega@@ watts . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generating , it would not be good &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; the un@@ v@@ eiling of the Co@@ vers followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an &apos;s ) , the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ an family ( with the exception of the problem gaps in Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as she ends the cover of her sister and ending with a classic turn : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;

&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more a picture than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertisers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were of the 8@@ 32 pages of the grove , 6@@ 15 pages advertisement ) . &quot;
&quot; the revelation of its co@@ ver@@ stars is so lon@@ ged , that in the last two years pictures of the magazine acc@@ ru@@ ed still before the official announcement . &quot;
&quot; women who were already on the cover , Na@@ omi Campbell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and K@@ ate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there were clearly more &quot; celebr@@ ity times , &quot; the Mod@@ ules &quot; as a &quot; Mod@@ els &quot; who are celebrities . &quot;
&quot; Oscar @-@ lau@@ re@@ ate and di@@ or brand @-@ brand Jennifer Lawrence was 2013 on the cover , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even at the low chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - which is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; break@@ age model &quot; &quot; of their generation - under the previous category , it is in good company . &quot;
&quot; these celebrities are not related to famous individuals or are not related to famous stars or young people from today , who know how to rot@@ ate a good Sn@@ ap@@ chat video ( even if all of them apply to Jen@@ ners ) . &quot;
they are truly talented women who are drawing up in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once appeared on the last cover , with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade on one of the most successful years of her career . &quot;
&quot; of course , Jena &apos;s success does not like it to anyone . &quot;
with its Reality @-@ TV history Jen@@ ners was always something tense in the fashion world .
in June critic@@ ised the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did and called them &quot; the M@@ ist@@ ails of the Moment . &quot;
these feelings co@@ ded again when the message with the appear Jen@@ ners appeared on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but to go to the mis@@ understanding seems to be passing by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is in the tru@@ est sense of the word a super@@ model .
it runs for Marc Jacobs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of E@@ ste@@ e Lau@@ der .
you and all her sisters sell you pictures of yourself on their respective Pay@@ wall apps .
they sold by her made pictures of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds daughter to the magazine .
and in her free time she is in the Reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and their children .
&quot; tourist centers speci@@ fies in 16@@ 0.000 people every year , &quot;
&quot; more than 16@@ 0.000 of the country &apos;s most depri@@ ved of the country are rejected annually by the constitu@@ ent centers , while the industry strikes the impact of further mid @-@ abbrevi@@ ations on already over@@ laid transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Queensland three of five people , immigrants , needy , needy victims , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ im@@ balances and similar products - are rejected in their case of free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the community , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; starting June of the next year , this legal centers will be more than 30 per cent of their own resources . &quot;
&quot; the director of the public dre@@ aming centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ n@@ rell , said that the last survey of the National Council of the Municipal Association revealed that thousands of people will be rejected each year . &quot;
Far@@ n@@ rell said that the situation could only be worse without the lifting of the German Federal Government .
&quot; que@@ ens in communities are chron@@ ically @-@ funded , which means thousands of people of important services that you need to be rejected , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with un@@ man@@ age@@ able and humili@@ ating debt , families that were released by separ@@ ations , workers who have un@@ just dis@@ miss@@ al - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they can not receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the German government will cut off the funds by 30 percent , meaning that thousands of helpl@@ ess people from Queensland will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any assistance . &quot;
&quot; we call for the General At@@ tor@@ ney General and Federal judicial Federal Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Queensland George Bran@@ dis in order to release these middle @-@ cuts as soon as people need help they need , in legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the government comp@@ lied with its commitment to lift funds for right guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of local communities and their communities , as well as the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump campaign charged after employees allegedly killed weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ umps campaign has been indicted for alleged in@@ activity , after it was communicated that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February have addressed a shepherd &apos;s weapon to an employee while in February in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program for the campaign in this federal state . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ i gave up , waited for months waited for the matter to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Kamp@@ ag@@ ar Manager , Earl Philip , &quot; moved a p@@ istol , placed his right foref@@ inger on the de@@ duction , and r@@ amm@@ ate the run in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; there was B@@ ordin@@ i in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; once he had compl@@ ained about the local and regional fight guidance , B@@ ordin@@ i set out that already at least four other persons had the same experience with Philli@@ p , he gave in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; there were B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate for a rebellion , when he said a crowd in North Carolina , said the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; - Sch@@ uss@@ med Forces , and weapon @-@ friends - measures should take action if his ri@@ val@@ in Hill@@ ary Clinton should be elected and judges should appoint . &quot;
&quot; m@@ umps campaign made clear that the media would have destroyed his words from the context , and that he would not stop violence . &quot;
&quot; ordin@@ ance complaint requires damages from the campaign for the violation of the duty of duty , and of Philip because of the violation of the legal duty and abi@@ ding of spiritual damage . &quot;
the m@@ umps Pres@@ ses@@ pre@@ cher@@ in Hope Hi@@ cks was not reached for an opinion .
attempts to contact Philip proposed likewise .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news sen@@ ders in Charlotte , announces that Philli@@ p is no longer an employee of the campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; during the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( 18 September ) , considerable losses for government parties and CD@@ U are characterised . &quot;
&quot; this was representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; while the red @-@ black government co @-@ ordin@@ ates in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and thus would have good opportunities to continue his head . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD res@@ isted 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent over five years ago at 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to survey , the party thus sm@@ iled up just under the CD@@ U back , which could come again to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left cheese at 19 per cent ( before 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented by 19 percent in the country for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in spite of slight losses , the Greens have hesit@@ ated with six percent ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) again in the heav@@ y@@ day of land . &quot;
&quot; with 3 percent , N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented by 3 percent in the country . &quot;
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives in the Berlin Chamber of Represent@@ atives , the SPD of the survey said therefore only to 23 percent ( election 2011 : 2@@ 8,@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 18 percent to 2@@ 3.4 per cent .
&quot; this puts you up even behind the Greens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would represent 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Represent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope to return to return the pirates would not be missed in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9@@ 000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
e @-@ mail and internet in Zeit@@ lu@@ pe : 20 years ago the Nokia communic@@ ator came onto the market .
the followers dominate the world today - his producer experienced a disaster .
the unit wei@@ ghed almost half a kilo@@ gram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and larger , therefore it was not well in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite a knock . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory was initially eight meg@@ ab@@ y@@ tes , which would be a high resolution today for approximately two years . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 Gigab@@ yte .
&quot; Nokia 9@@ 000 communic@@ ator came exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , to the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the devices in the internet , but they come somehow from the Stone Age of the internet era . &quot;
20 years ago , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months before at CeBIT in Hanover as an &quot; office in the West@@ ent@@ asch@@ en@@ format . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent to a lot : SMS and e @-@ mails were sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
even access to websites was possible via HTML @-@ browser if even agon@@ izing slow .
&quot; a pocket calcul@@ ator was available , a digital addres@@ s@@ book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be fol@@ ly like a laptop . &quot;
then we found a small keyboard and a black @-@ white screen .
&quot; very proud was the price : 2@@ 700 D @-@ Mark , so about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average sales price of a smartphones in Germany was € 3@@ 92 .
nobody could see in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would become the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the mobile as@@ parag@@ us of the Finn@@ s experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and wrapped at Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market already dominate vendors who came all much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for very many people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; some 1.4 billion devices have been sold , on Samsung and Apple , of which alone are 5@@ 55 million pieces . &quot;
&quot; worldwide , global sales with the devices is around 400 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the well @-@ running shops of the countless app providers and tel@@ co @-@ telecommunications companies come . &quot;
all around the smartphone has now emerged as a whole industry .
&quot; the decisive breakthrough into the mass market was only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time , Apple Chef Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three pieces in one : one music player , a phone and an internet communications , easy to use by touch @-@ screen . &quot;
the victory of Apple began still today is the iPhone the most important product of the Group .
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the night . &quot;
&quot; finally , you disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
now the sa@@ ws have now Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is 20 years after its invention a matter of course .
&quot; in the section , each German now looks 88 times a day on his cell phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone also sometimes , &quot; said Jan@@ ina sphere , in the Siemens @-@ Management Board of Personal . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic Mind and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw is not only going to be used in our local commun@@ es and throughout London , but throughout the country of renewal and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; for me , it was the largest attraction of He@@ a@@ thro@@ ws , just as in 2012 in London when we worked out a great deal of effort to ensure that all of our nations and regions prof@@ ited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great advantages for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be accomplished by creating new opportunities for local companies and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already establishing 10,000 new apprenti@@ ces , create new jobs and prepare youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London , there will be such a thing that will think that the challenge of extension he@@ a@@ thro@@ ws is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ using on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ gly ed in 2012 and they are also wrong with He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
how the Olympic Games is He@@ a@@ throw for many and not for individual a infrastructure project .
&quot; enlargement is an opportunity to create up to 18@@ 0.000 new jobs , £ 211 billion in funny growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both to the airport and in whole GB . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion net investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third drive , which is supported by £ 16 billion to private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for the UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ a@@ throw will also be one .
it is time for us to ste@@ er this olymp@@ ic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as create our future business and create a legacy of skills and employment to be proud of England .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; on display blocks &quot;
&quot; for companies that are making money making money , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to cope with one of the software manufacturers attempts to cope with a &quot; &quot; cat@@ tery and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block signs on his desktop , published Ad@@ block Plus a blo@@ g@@ post in which it communic@@ ates that users can update their filters in the program to block more advertising in the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his Des@@ k@@ top@@ us would change the enco@@ ding with regard to his advertisements , to make it scor@@ ching the detection on which part of the page advertising is to make difficult to detect . &quot;
&quot; however , Ad@@ block proclaimed that there is a new way to handle the new codes . &quot;
&quot; in a blo@@ gger post , the speaker of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind H@@ in @-@ and @-@ H@@ er battle is already underway since the invention of ad lock@@ ers in progress , and that it is possible that Facebook will soon arrive with a new solution . &quot;
&quot; the fact that the world &apos;s largest company has left social media in the fight , is a strong indi@@ z to see how worrying indicators have become for the industry . &quot;
&quot; according to a study last year , Pa@@ w@@ air and Adobe will use some 200 million people displaying ad lock@@ ers ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1,@@ 03 billion active users who access Facebook via their mobile devices , Hand@@ y@@ advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue , fac@@ ebooks makes . &quot;
&quot; the company has put it on display block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Fac@@ ebooks mobile app for the social network and inst@@ agram , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertising on desktop PCs is sufficient for the revenue of revenue , so Facebook appears that the investment of such a step is worthwhile as a re@@ warding . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared with that it would update his &quot; display prize pool &quot; to give people more control over it . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook maintained that additional filters would be worrying whether they would also block content on the page , which are no advertising . &quot;
&quot; for users this is not a positive experience , therefore we are planning to address the problem , shared a speakers of Facebook in an e @-@ mail communication . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences , in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with suspected su@@ icide on Swiss highway over@@ ride
the sacrifice was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman was transferred on a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday during a suspected su@@ icide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of V@@ aud shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman wrapped in the dark &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; on the road and were taken by several cars , the police said in V@@ aud . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a sweat at the age of 49 years , that was passed by several vehicles , including a truck , was to kill itself . &quot;
it died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police officers , who call this and every witness of the incident . &quot;
&quot; it was opened an investigation process , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , he shared Gilles Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter to Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gene@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a clash avoidable ?
&quot; this is something that the pro@@ secutor must decide , &quot; &quot; Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter said . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers are not held accountable .
&quot; in each of the two cases - where a person in the dark on the highway ran , it was decided that motor@@ ists don &apos;t have to assume that a pedest@@ rians running in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year a poli@@ ce@@ tion was acqu@@ itted of the forced kill@@ ings after spending a man over and killed , who was in August 2014 of a night on the A1 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victims had drunk , and has become unconscious on the street . &quot;
&quot; the court confirmed that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- on a justified way , and that the presence of a man on the road was an &quot; completely unusual and un@@ predictable situation , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
&quot; anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges , should report on police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 . &quot;
NASA Climate : Venus was once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the proj@@ ections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was likely to be inhab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resem@@ ble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have occurred with its hot , waterproof surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere once again . &quot;
scientists have previously suggested that slow revers@@ al of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; however , the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ similar atmosphere and nevertheless slowly revol@@ ved . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet is thought to be more dry areas than the earth , but once enough water and geographic vari@@ ability once had to live life and put them in front of a rapid de@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
the early Venus benefited also from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation expon@@ entially expon@@ entially off their daily side of the Sun almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain , which creates a thick layer , creates what an umbrella appears to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
&quot; the result is average temperatures , which are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today . &quot;
the model brought forth a history of Venus that was similar to evolution that was previously thought of Plan@@ etary research .
although she was probably inhab@@ itable the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ added heat and ultra@@ violet light .
their oceans ev@@ apor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was blown away by the ultra @-@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydr@@ ation , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained at carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know them today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a trainer of Go@@ an@@ che
&quot; Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations in Colorado , and led to a low @-@ determination right in the team &apos;s decision @-@ making process . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of Color@@ ful Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and pointed out that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the past three years I have fulfilled my duties as chief trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations the Colorado , with energy , passion and determination , expressed by the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; over the course of the summer , I have thought much about how I could improve this team to give him more depth to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the Vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly aligned to the organisation &apos;s organisation . &quot;
he also has to have a co @-@ determination right in decisions that affect the team &apos;s performance .
these conditions are not fulfilled at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had gr@@ ated Roy on 23 May 2013 , than@@ ked him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick has informed me about this decision today , &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he did for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the winner of the Jack Adams Award during his debut season in 2013 @-@ 14 as the Best Trainer of the League .
&quot; he led the club on 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was be@@ aten up in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minnesota and missed the after@@ math in each of the last two years . &quot;
the description marked in season 2015 @-@ 16 a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark and fell behind the Wild for a second Wild@@ Card spot in the Western Conference around five points .
&quot; as Hall of Fame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Can@@ adi@@ ens and the book . &quot;
Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ o@@ iled workers resume talks on strike the strike
&quot; the labour struggles in relation to the compensation for Nord@@ se@@ e@@ oil workers will be exposed , while all armed forces sit for a new round of discussion at the table , they said leaders . &quot;
strikes against the oil field services provider Wood Group were spor@@ adic@@ ally carried out on platforms in the North Sea that run by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and r@@ ammed unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the wrap @-@ process of the current dispute , &quot; says it in a common statement . &quot;
we will hold some day @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks to start the start of next year to address the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , who is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
wood Group has reduced the R@@ ates to its contracts in the North Sea by about 9 percent due to negative market pressure .
the ratings of the company follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractor in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts in the company gives the needed space to get through the market down@@ turn .
Shell has released for its part thousands of people and plans to abandon his oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries as its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ collaboration with the British energy company BG Group ration@@ alized .
&quot; due to the lower crude oil prices , it is due to lower crude oil prices , an economic situation that has increased by the decision of the British in June , the European Union . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , the Scottish parliament@@ union member Dave Anderson met the leaders in order to discuss one of the biggest contribut@@ ory activities that occurred since a generation in the North Sea . &quot;
&quot; North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy , which works for many and not just a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1,4 billion spent on new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion is expected over the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rotation of stars in the star @-@ wre@@ ck of the P@@ lei@@ ades
&quot; the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Wel@@ dre@@ tel@@ escope has helped astronom@@ ers , to collect the full catalogue of rotation rates among the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades of the P@@ lei@@ ades . &quot;
&quot; the new data help the astronom@@ ers to understand why stars in the cluster are rotating at different levels , as well as in which connection the rotation periods are available with the planetary process . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through the comparisons of our results with other constell@@ ations , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Luisa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light @-@ years from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster which were created around 125 million years ago , are now grown into adul@@ thood . &quot;
it is now on the fastest .
too high @-@ rotation rates b@@ ump out large amounts of star @-@ winds .
&quot; as these winds are travelling through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a bra@@ king effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; if a star is outdated , its rotation begins to dec@@ eler@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star , by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of an identifiable star@@ ch -- like sun@@ spots -- det@@ ects . &quot;
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates points out that more solid @-@ stars revol@@ ve slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars slower p@@ rou@@ ets revol@@ ve as smaller . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the Ple@@ j@@ ads we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars &quot; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rot@@ ation in both directions , younger and older &apos; , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still much to know about what we would like to learn more about how , when , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and to speak their &quot; dancing shoes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues have reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rotation rates of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the A@@ stronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;

&quot; I say &quot; Goo@@ dbye &quot; to the &quot; &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ants of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ guez was elected for the most valuable player of the league , 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; his signature under a tenth year contract , has been owned by 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the contrac@@ eption on 31 December 2017 , he will in future act as a consultant and youth coach . &quot;
as a player it paid off Rodri@@ guez long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 H@@ its and 2021 points for his team ( &quot; &quot; R@@ us &quot; &quot; ) for Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas Rang@@ ers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed some milestones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall of Fame &apos;s Hall H@@ ank Aaron and Willi@@ e M@@ ays , only two other bas@@ eball players indicate similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be recorded in the glory of the bas@@ eb@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; for so successfully Rodri@@ guez - nickname &quot; A @-@ Rod &quot; - in the field was , so controversial is his appearance outside the place . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star at &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; had been killed in 2009 , between 2001 and 2003 , having been bot@@ tled stero@@ ids . &quot;
in August 2013 he was blocked because of a processing in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 for 211 games .
Rodri@@ guez is regarded as the main memory to have obtained for years via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South @-@ Florida .
after a dispute the lock was still reduced to 162 encounters .
&quot; the league could have done for the year 2014 even a favor , because I played 20 years without a break , Rodri@@ guez said then . &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days were not smo@@ ked .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends in their last games get once again the big stage , Rodri@@ guez frequently had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; be Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ guez , who was married with the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress K@@ ate Hudson , &quot; sympath@@ ies of the fans from the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ Rod , &quot; put the p@@ endant at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ guez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa and Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski are first dop@@ ing accidents &quot;
bl@@ ur@@ red : because of a positive dop@@ ing it may not start wei@@ ghted wei@@ ghted Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski in Poland in Rio .
Rio de Janeiro - The Olympic Games in 2016 are over@@ sh@@ ado@@ wed by the first official dop@@ ing accidents .
a caught athle@@ te could have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing cases have become known as the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacles in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa made in Brazil and the Polish wei@@ ch@@ the@@ ber Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the onset of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions come from this news at the time of time . &quot;
&quot; at Ch@@ en , during the last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de has been proven to be used as a mas@@ king force for dop@@ ing instances . &quot;
&quot; the International Sport@@ Court CAS , confirmed on Friday afternoon local time to its exclusion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday the 18 @-@ year @-@ old spent the fourth place in the final over 100 m butter@@ fly , only at 0.@@ 09 seconds missed the bronze . &quot;
on Friday Ch@@ en would have to participate in the trials over 50 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l .
Ch@@ en has requested the opening of the B @-@ sample and a hearing for the former Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) .
&quot; the national association take the matter &quot; &quot; very serious and demanded by Ch@@ en &apos;s full cooperation with the investigations , &quot; &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a communication : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport@@ shof CAS and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CAS for the restoration of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
also in the night of Rio se@@ oo@@ ed the message about the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa by the 33 @-@ year @-@ old then went into the offensive .
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this is &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is inno@@ cent , &quot; &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements &quot; , &quot; stated the athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is said that the substance will be the blood @-@ offering for the blood @-@ offering . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa has been already suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample is supposed to be very positive . &quot;
Bulg@@ arians Prime Minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ ov immediately drew in touch with criticism of the Ath@@ ine &apos;s Eve .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes do not move the right keys , &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; We Bulg@@ arians stand under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
thus about all weights from the chron@@ ically @-@ wei@@ ghted nation may not take part in Rio .
&quot; on Friday also the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ in@@ ski &quot; , &quot; the London olymp@@ ic winner in class up to 85 kg was tested as his brother Tom@@ as@@ z tested three days before positive to the an@@ abolic stero@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both pun@@ ishing the intake , both may not start in class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; in front of the launch of the athle@@ tics , Dan@@ ek@@ o@@ wa is a further heavy blow to the reputation of the entire sport . &quot;
&quot; the World association IA@@ AF had the complete Russian team up to an exception because of systematic dop@@ ing the start , even the runners of Kenya produce numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the swimming sport , the former Ver@@ sions in China had also taken a fierce debate between the athletes . &quot;
in this way the French@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t has attacked the Chinese olymp@@ ic Sun Yang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Yang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ lac , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium about 200 m of Fre@@ isti@@ l , I want to pass , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the center of a confrontation with the Australia &apos;s M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun was tested positively by the Chinese Championships on the stimulation of the tri@@ met@@ azi@@ oni , but had to sit only a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ kl@@ au : so per@@ fi@@ de er@@ pres@@ sen h@@ ackers their ran@@ som
programmers of compres@@ sing mal@@ ware currently have targeted companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey conducted by Mal@@ ware @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes , among 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of surve@@ yed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , partially victims of an attack with black@@ ma@@ iler software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were once the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mailing . &quot;
40 percent of victims charged by the perpetrators requested by the perpetrators to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
the perpetrators specialized their black@@ ma@@ iler software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes on attacks in corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potentially inj@@ ecting ran@@ som clearly higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the damage software , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to commerci@@ alise advertising . &quot;
then we discovered the perpetrators of re@@ pris@@ al software .
&quot; only , private users were the target , but the change to company attacks occurred rapidly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works for a simple pattern : once on the computer of a victim , they search for un@@ long changed files such as Word@@ Press@@ , Ex@@ cel@@ - or database files as well as according to archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; after that , the software presents the demands of the black@@ ma@@ ths . &quot;
&quot; to get the final turn@@ key code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ currency Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are using the personal photo database at stake , it is at companies for sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage is made if a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 per cent of the German companies affected by Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 per cent even had to break the operations completely , in one case people were aware of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have been victims of attacks , whose patients may be threatened by loss of hospitals . &quot;
&quot; we say the victims always : pays not , you thus promote only the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies , paying their data will get back . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of a stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
the h@@ ackers again know this and try to build a good rep@@ utation .
&quot; in a current study the safety researchers from F @-@ Secure the utility areas and the contact with the black@@ mail@@ ers examines and come to the result : the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service , in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims by chat , as they can pay by Bit@@ coin , direct accessible support sites , or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and individuals received after payments of only few hundred Euros , companies must pay partly hard and pay five @-@ digit sums to return their data to de@@ cryp@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , the h@@ acker will become more professional and share the work , explains the security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski of Anti@@ virus @-@ vendor Sop@@ hos : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; more likely , it is that it is about three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their pollutants in the form of a software building to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous mal@@ ware kits were created by the Mal@@ ware itself , consulting and additional tools purchased for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; the package includes a adaptation tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ ma@@ sts are then looking for more h@@ ackers in order to spread the freshly introduced software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums on the underground , buying a set of a crime no@@ vels and asked another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is made per ann@@ ated machine .
&quot; usually over@@ take the criminals then sp@@ ammer with the spread , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; by now , the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better secure their data . &quot;
&quot; over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes survey will trust that Ran@@ som@@ ware can rep@@ el off , by file @-@ back @-@ ups and sc@@ ann@@ er@@ software . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful fatigue more , the perpetrators are instead responsible for the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ y@@ tes @-@ Chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; thus , the damage potential is much higher than before the type of data is much higher than before . &quot;
the perpetrators will in future be able to take completely new goals on the internet of things .
on the Hack@@ er@@ Conference Def@@ con illustrated security researchers as they could get using the Internet verb@@ s thermo@@ stat under their control .
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activ@@ ating of such a block of heating could be quite a ran@@ som &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if the perpetrators then instead of block the heating in the future could block the entire production road in a factory , Ran@@ som@@ ware may also be a subject in industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and everyday @-@ saving
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda will pack everything : a little S@@ UV , a little cou@@ pe and also the versatility of a mini@@ vans . &quot;
&quot; sounds pretty up@@ loading , but the HR @-@ V , who was built on the same new platform as the new jazz is actually proving to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , passengers have a lot of space both in the first row and in the F@@ ond . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and act pleasant , only the cock@@ pit @-@ top falls off there . &quot;
versatile vehicles is the HR @-@ V in the storage box .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ end and 10@@ 26 l for cl@@ oned back @-@ arm@@ rests , but there is the &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical , than it sounds : the sitting areas of the back@@ seat can be ch@@ ained like kin@@ os@@ es@@ sel and thus provide storage space , which is high up to ceilings 1.@@ 24 m high . &quot;
&quot; the trunk is well loaded , but the charging height with 650 mm is slightly higher than comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1,6 @-@ l @-@ powered with 88 kW / 120 HP speeds up the HR @-@ V thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges very powerful .
he might have to do his job a bit more qui@@ eter .
pleasing is the all @-@ day usage of 4.7 l / 100 km .
there is another mot@@ orization : one 1,5 @-@ l gasoline engines with 96 kW / 130 HP .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the handling @-@ behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
&quot; however , the steering is likely to be a little more direct . &quot;
&quot; the equipment leaves in the tested top @-@ version &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; no wishes open . &quot;
&quot; for the safety systems , the City @-@ Not@@ t@@ ms@@ ass@@ istent ( works as far as speed 32 ) , the coll@@ isions @-@ system and the Sp@@ ur@@ super@@ visor . &quot;

and the intelligent temp@@ o responds to the traffic signals and th@@ rot@@ ate when required the speed .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is available only for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , Nav@@ i , App @-@ Integration and More . &quot;
&quot; two US@@ B@@ - and an HDMI socket are under the arm@@ rest , and are therefore somewhat awk@@ ward . &quot;
the approximately 29@@ 000 Euro for the well equipped top @-@ diesel cars are fine .
&quot; who does not want to invest so much , receives the petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 Euro . &quot;

Air@@ line is not liable : overthrow on Air@@ ports
an Air@@ line is not liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger &apos;s Bridge .
&quot; a liability is conceivable only in dangers which are typical of air traffic , argu@@ ing the Upper Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had broken down with the overthrow a knee injury .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it is a general risk of life , such as judgment . &quot;
the airline had to not pay a damages to the man .
disease : when paid the organizer
&quot; after your trip , holiday@@ makers get only money back after their trip , if the cause of the illness is dou@@ bt@@ lessly found in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; but this is only the case , if more than ten percent of the guests are proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the case , a family was heavy due to diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting a family on the second day of its tur@@ no@@ ons . &quot;
she spent almost all of the holiday in the room .
their illness led the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a def@@ ective se@@ wage plant that supposedly poll@@ uted the sea water .
&quot; the family was the view , the trip would have been insufficient - and mour@@ ned against the organizer . &quot;
the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff had no success in court .
in fact the se@@ wage plant was in fact def@@ ective .
&quot; however , the promot@@ er experienced only shortly before departure of the pl@@ ain@@ ti@@ ff of them . &quot;
he had to assume until then that the sea@@ water was in order .
&quot; he therefore has not violated his duty obligations , so the judgment . &quot;
especially since in the samples of the water no contamination have been found .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly through con@@ cre@@ ase among each other - belong to the general risk of life .
from 6@@ 91 guests only 38 fallen ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , according to the violence perpetr@@ ated by refugees in Wür@@ zburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be dis@@ missed and decided at the same time to counter terrorism .
for sure : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetrators with hate and split .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this triumph we will not treat the terrorists . &quot;
&quot; if pen@@ ter would have to leave the country faster , but increase security and strength also the approval of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the Bundestag in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced another person@@ elle strengthening of security forces , and indeed &quot; in medium @-@ dimensional size order over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympath@@ ize for terrorism must be under punishment again .
video surveillance should be improved if arms are to be re@@ alis@@ tically presented so that especially the purchase of weapons on the Internet is complicated .
the last much discussed welding light for doctors will be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words .
&quot; however , he wants to look for solutions in the dialogue with the doctors , as the threat to the citizens can be reduced , he spoke about psych@@ ic symptoms . &quot;
&quot; to counter@@ act a radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister keeps a better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers would have to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ sed people .
&quot; to the persecution of criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of co@@ vert investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD Chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to increasing security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister was clearly pronounced against shareholders . &quot;
&quot; that was an ear for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; said Gabriel the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Medi@@ group ( Friday ) . &quot;
&quot; in Mai@@ zi@@ ère , Ru@@ g from the Union had rejected a bur@@ ka ban and abol@@ ishment of double citizenship . &quot;
a general ban of the power supply is un@@ constitutional problematic .
&quot; you can not ban everything you re@@ jects , and I refuse the wearing of the Bur@@ ka . &quot;
talk about rules about road traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green @-@ chief in Simone Peter gave the minister , he wanted to simul@@ ate with a new anti @-@ terror package of energy and man@@ oeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; the left @-@ party Par@@ eich@@ ef Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; the fleet Sp@@ ins and a ti@@ ghtening of the common side bring people no more security in this country . &quot;
better traffic @-@ flow on the auto@@ bahn
it will be regularly posted on the road road - here &apos;s a picture of November .
&quot; however , that is to change : the legal devi@@ ation should be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car of the motor@@ ists who are standing on the traffic road every night in the traffic jam , when they go over the highway &apos; Zu@@ ro@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; inland road construction extends next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the hammer road and the exit Wes@@ eler road the right hol@@ lows over 700 meters . &quot;
car can then be viewed directly from the hammer road on the right .
&quot; the great advantage : traffic will increase early , reducing the total of the cycle on the multi @-@ driven section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the prolonged exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district of the agency Münster @-@ West .
the driving distance on the fe@@ eder is nervous the motor@@ ists especially between 17 and 19 hours .
on week@@ days the fe@@ ather goes down to the bridge over the Alber@@ Sloven@@ e way and sometimes even beyond .
the reason is the hole on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler street .
from here the traffic is directed only one lane on the motorway bridge .
the second track had to be built in front of a three @-@ quarter years ago .
the reason : static calculations had resulted in that the bridge no longer has the required capacity to include the heavy traffic .
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ pass and the related traffic @-@ day traffic will not last , the official state can not be said . &quot;
&quot; however , it is expected to calculate with years : because the bridge has an official rest period up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the renewal of the legal direction , the state is deliberately chosen to choose the traffic @-@ weaker time in the school holidays because with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic will take place on Tuesday and on Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : cultural activities for schools
the international class of the Wald@@ schule visited the theater piece &quot; The Inv@@ isible House . &quot;
the club N@@ ima &apos;s and the young theatre are now planning a musical project .
the Club N@@ ima &apos;s allows young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s home has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning denom@@ ination &quot; &quot; The Inv@@ isible House &quot; &quot; of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; &quot; N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; &quot; Inter@@ cultural trip &quot; &quot; 19 students visited the small house between eleven and 15 years . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association dedicated to the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background to the aim of visiting schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster , within the framework of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , including Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria and say little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the s@@ zen@@ ic images and video animations it would have been possible to follow the course of action , thus the press release of the Young Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az Wester@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without escape and migration background between 14 and 20 years will receive the opportunity to visit professional dance , dance , drama and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the@@ atri@@ cal and the@@ atri@@ cal language training agency are available in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural journey &quot; continues .
&quot; given the Ascen@@ ded refugee flow , the association expects many classes to take part in . &quot;
rain instead of ast@@ o@@ ids : hope for weather conditions
the weather has made the star sou@@ ps in the southwest of Germany during the night to Friday a d@@ ash through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was badly suited for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ estial spectacle , said the chairman of the observatory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of ast@@ o@@ ks on the sky . &quot;
&quot; it is Per@@ sei@@ den , with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour to the fastest star sou@@ ps . &quot;
&quot; they have their name because they apparently come from the constellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which is located in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping .
&quot; having rolled it all around the evening , one is stub@@ born around for hours , in the morning there is no longer awake in the morning to think more of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; nevertheless , with such problems in good company : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults sleep , and more than ten percent do their sleep frequently or permanently as not rest@@ or@@ ative . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleeping disorders ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleeping disorders , and there are many causes behind them , empha@@ sizes Hans @-@ Günter Weber &apos;s , Board Member of the German Society for Sle@@ eping Research and Sle@@ eping medicine . &quot;
&quot; however , what you want is , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , therefore a inhal@@ ation and sle@@ ep@@ y . &quot;
&quot; just that per@@ me@@ able feel many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or insufficient , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , Board Member of the German Haus@@ physician association with practice in the Lower Saxony @-@ Sax@@ on Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sle@@ eves ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there may be organic , mental or behavi@@ oral factors , but also medications . &quot;
not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder .
&quot; very early it is up to all during a depression , &quot; &quot; says We@@ wo@@ e . &quot;
and it can be that different factors would like together .
&quot; who for example has a sli@@ pped disk , can lie down badly , wake up every two to three hours and begins to greet , about everyday problems and -@@ to greet , there is an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you pay with sleeping disorders to the doctor ?
&quot; who is not well vers@@ ed over a period of one month in at least three nights per week , and the day is com@@ promised , should go to the doctor . &quot;
&quot; impairment can look quite different : it is tired , tired , un@@ disturbed sleep , has difficulty with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has m@@ oods or physical discomfort as stomach or head@@ ache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate the disorder , it is important to find out the causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options come among other things , behaviour changes , an cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or even medication - classic in@@ clin@@ ations only in an emergency and most up for two weeks - in@@ quired . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any rainf@@ all available in Germany , Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , Head of the interdisciplinary centre at the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore one should consult with sleep problems initially at the primary care physician , &quot;
it can clear up with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for the examination in the sleeping laboratory , it is an example of snor@@ ing with respiratory suffer@@ ings , in disease @-@ sickness , at sleeping @-@ time , or if you fail to find the cause of a sle@@ ep@@ y disorder . &quot;
you really do not have to prepare for the study .
one should spend the day normally .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after bon@@ ding one goes to his normal time in bed .

what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming has
the former German s@@ wimm@@ ers Markus Dei@@ bler expressed itself on Facebook to dis@@ appoint the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
in December 2014 he held gold for the first time in Doha and at the same time represented his first world record .
now the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ let Markus Dei@@ bler via Facebook can be put forward in his criticism of his ex @-@ team .
&quot; in a country where a Olympi@@ ad gets 20,000 euros , and a jungle is 150@@ ,000 € should no one be wondering about missing medals , &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old at night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in the swimming sport is bad , the dop@@ ing checks very well . &quot;
&quot; in this way , we cannot compete with countries that promote very much and do not do so closely on the subject of dop@@ ing or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that here the controls should be set , &quot; &quot; he stated . &quot;
&quot; wanted to start a com@@ eback , the di@@ bler needs to be reported nine months before his first start of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Deutschland ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
it should be exactly like that with countries too .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled at a certain time before the World Cup / OS of independent controllers of W@@ ada / fin@@ a , must not participate , &quot; &quot; calls on the choice of Hamburg who now operates a Eis@@ di@@ ele . &quot;
airport : ban@@ de of baggage is arrested
professional th@@ iev@@ es at the airport of Düsseldorf
&quot; in Thursday , the Local Court issued the arrest of two women and two men at the age of 50 to 61 years . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed as ban@@ de several hand@@ bags and luggage stit@@ ches .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 p.m. civil officials in the area of the airport Düsseldorf a ban@@ de , which was known to the poli@@ c@@ emen of past theft . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had been committed several times since the middle of July , and were involved in a collective , work@@ sheet and especially professional . &quot;
&quot; the experts of the crime syndic@@ ate 34 can off@@ end the th@@ iev@@ es , which had entered off@@ ence for crimes against Germany , four acts . &quot;
&quot; overall , they had exploited a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; in the first sight , the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße in Berlin @-@ Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in seems not at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a fres@@ her nursery and a bi@@ ol@@ ades . &quot;
in the façade of a gray house someone has &quot; ugly ! &quot; bla@@ sted .
&quot; opposite to a Li@@ d@@ l , which shall also be demol@@ ished , it is already built : until 2017 there is a house with high windows and 133 new rental apartments . &quot;
&quot; article about these &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible property company Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in is called , in recent weeks we pre@@ fers with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied by now , the residents rental agreements , on the ground floor are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; particularly the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Hen@@ kel , particularly in the beginning of the year , had repeatedly called for a hard action of the police against the project , the area called &quot; No @-@ Go @-@ Zone &quot; for poli@@ c@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomy . &quot;
&quot; after on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schm@@ iede , were vac@@ ated by 300 police officers , according to 30 to 40 officials and three teams on site , blocked parts of the road and stopped visitors to enter the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , its renovated building work on behalf of the un@@ familiar owner of the house is the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July a Berlin Board of Directors decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later , police and builders at the J@@ ew came from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon , the street works peaceful : parents walk with children , people sitting on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about sp@@ ig@@ i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gart@@ ens .
&quot; left Viol@@ ence is not the chief of many inhabitants : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kiev since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who goes here three children , above all from the police presence of gener@@ v@@ t . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the home projects , they share the concern for r@@ ents and G@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; it does not sound according to a pine , who wish to medit@@ ate mostly police officers in front of v@@ and@@ ali@@ zing left . &quot;
the dit@@ ch which the Berlin interior sen@@ ator and the police between domestic and their neighbors will be revealed .
&quot; Friedrichs@@ ha@@ in in the east of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district , which also today in comparison with the rest of the city come a low average income and has a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in addition , home@@ work and the native @-@ born projects have long been part of the Bank : 1990 numerous houses have been occupied in the former GDR , including nearly all the Main@@ zer road very close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been cleared from a large police station at a down@@ right road , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who occupied it for 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district in recent years has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and Ele@@ ber@@ liner from all over the world : with them now inhabitants come from the GDR and former house@@ wives . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable during the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them by the sli@@ ces or newly built fac@@ ades that have been ej@@ ected with color explo@@ ding .
&quot; no other road was mentioned in this year , along with the words &quot; &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a reason that not all neighbours may see this as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes such as body lesi@@ ons pass , according to statistics , almost exclusively against poli@@ c@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences make atomic facts , which tends to make the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives for 17 years in a rental house next to the disputed 94 , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; regarding violence , it is medi@@ ated : people in 94 are their neighbours who are not meant to be . &quot;
the famous cars also give it straight to the Rig@@ a@@ er longer anymore .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal point , on the contrary . &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer has become aware of the Rig@@ a@@ ean street .
&quot; therefore , it was also so important that the inhabitants left their road : from the police , the politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road will continue to take away : by prec@@ arious re@@ constructions in the former building blocks , which thr@@ ong the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; these are finally con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - here are some people who are not as good be@@ held , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; violence and destruction can I absolutely not limit . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; but what can you do , if any one hear somebody ? &quot;
&quot; there is frustration on all sides , even with the police and the residents . &quot;
&quot; for admittedly , who hardened themselves over color bom@@ bers , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the home projects and the left scene belonged to the pine . &quot;
&quot; who pul@@ ls , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , can complain bad about noise . &quot;
all persons presented only with first names have been asked to not be called by their proper name
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugees
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer .
&quot; moreover , it is a social worker on site . &quot;
&quot; since July Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le , the refugee officers for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the Social @-@ Educ@@ ational team supports the management of the Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees itself as a contact for all players : refugees , the work of refugee camps , administration , authorities and who else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the experience W@@ oll@@ mi@@ ch@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less spot@@ ting than on the multitude of desire areas would be focused - meant , when administration wanted to write the place . &quot;
&quot; searched for was a administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ term experience in the field of social work , just an ins@@ isted W@@ oll@@ mi@@ ch@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people , and also behind the scenes as well as network in@@ activity . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been doing this for about six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position on three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le Ehr@@ lich and full @-@ time actors are supported . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small issues , organizational , human and insur@@ rec@@ tional problems . &quot;
soon new containers are available in the washing road
&quot; a serious problem has been recognized for some time , apartments for connecting units , which have been acknowledged . &quot;
for the inter@@ connection the municipalities are responsible .
you must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility will change from the store in the Commune and job center .
problem : there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been proven to be very difficult for some time .
there is no need for administration of private apartments .
&quot; you have so far failed to rely on private apartments , so Deu@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common apartments must be seen as it is so beautiful . &quot;
&quot; so , new containers will soon be placed in the washing road . &quot;
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the key@@ word , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; besides a fixed lead , they are intern@@ ships , educational places , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be f@@ and@@ able or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help master master , do charitable work - and this motiv@@ ates and very or@@ derly , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that working for the community to become a positive activity .
this is &quot; no employment therapy . &quot;
&quot; however , activity means not only work . &quot;
&quot; the day needs a fixed structure , say deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people must develop a sense of awareness .
&quot; so there will be offers such as sports , contacts with native people and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
so you can also jump to manage and volunteer .
&quot; it is central that the refugees get the feeling , they are welcome and welcome in Germany . &quot;
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must declare to the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful to bridge , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who eventually develop the feeling , he could not help in Ur@@ bach anyone , should not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; however , problem incidents there are also , says the customer honest , &quot; &quot; people where nothing goes . &quot; &quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is therefore always to motivate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mamm@@ oth task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : have the two happ@@ enings in fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer quite clearly , &quot; what some could call naive &quot; . &quot; a res@@ isi@@ ko could and doesn &apos;t want to exclude them . &quot;
&quot; sensi@@ ti@@ zes be the hel@@ per , but already . &quot;
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the kill@@ ings bring them completely into temptation .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; so , the main and volunteers have to be held on @-@ site and in the region to activities . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they always have in the background that soon a new peak of refugees and migrants would come to Ur@@ bach . &quot;
does Germany need an upper limit ?
this is clearly to answer this question .
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we have not yet arrived , where we would like to go , &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
no new refugees who would be able to relax .
Reg@@ ine customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bacher shall also be lau@@ ghed heavily up to the previous men .
&quot; these are currently some 100 people , mostly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they need to help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complex , there is no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : intru@@ der with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew for approximately one hour to several areas - un@@ successful .
two un@@ familiar men are penetr@@ ated on the Friday morning against 8.@@ 50 o &apos;clock in an apartment in a multi@@ family home in the ruler .
the resident surprised the two and hit the awk@@ ward into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1,@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ hed , bore both Blue@@ berry and black cap@@ u@@ zen@@ et . &quot;
you flee the direction of downtown .
&quot; on the flag@@ ging the police put several strings , as well as a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag@@ ging ran without success .
eventually the unknown was indeed near the apartment or at their escape .
