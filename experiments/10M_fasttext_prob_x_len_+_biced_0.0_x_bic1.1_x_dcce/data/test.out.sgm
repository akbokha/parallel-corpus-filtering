<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf player in South Africa, Bernhard Langer was looking for a little variation with a horseback ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a first.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "Golden Sepyramide" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses recalled on their festivities, they came home to the forage in a fast gallop."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," says Langer. "</seg>
<seg id="9">And then the equestrian accordion ended up again.</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany was the best golfer of all time - 101 tournament tournaments - close to horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let him run with his family through the plant of the ALRV, on a horse, he didn't even look for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">The first time in Aachen and thus also at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports help ranged the man from Anhausen into the framework of a small gala.</seg>
<seg id="15">On awards it lacks the likeable athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundeslainkreuz, silbernes Lorbeerblatt, Champions Tour of the Year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already dressed him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th winner of the sport pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="19">In Aachen he met the first prize of Hans GÃ¼nter Winkler on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means very much," says Langer, "" for it is not only awarded for sportive successes but also for social involvement. "</seg>
<seg id="21">For decades long-term has been promoting the offspring.</seg>
<seg id="22">And so he also gave the prize money of 25.000 Euro to the same.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding sportsmen, the two-time U.S. mast is awarded on Saturday to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports. ""</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinics and trumps policies in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent trade agreement TTP - this is both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential attacks are in the control and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a principled, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">The role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">Trump wants to keep in doubt rather small and warns how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to steer the economy to death, and to regulate his death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"himself, on the other hand, would be quite different."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively withdraw regulations, and it is strong for far-reaching tax reform with lower tax practices - for individuals and businesses."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton says: the state has certain tasks to perform, it has disadvantages opportunities to open up and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, the taxes would increase to the rich," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to be invested, Trump and Clinton have almost worded."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate in announcing the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in the infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly refused by the state-critical tea wings of the Republican.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in Trump, we might have even more party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">More evident are the differences in energy and climate policies.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and extend the coal mining in the USA again.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil-mining should also be possible in so far protected areas to terminate the Paris mitigation agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in contrast, Clinton wants to expand and expand the renewable energies with their investment program:" "a country will create the superpower of clean energies and create millions of jobs." ""</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpacific trade agreement, do both want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both however, want to isolate the US not from international trade - but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"these are to be paid better then, for instance Clinton calls for some Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of 7.25 US dollars is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to raise it up to $15 per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must renter, then he says he should not be altered."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the control policies of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand stands Trump, which wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics follow him, so that the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least demand from the rich, that they pay more taxes, and their critics say, more taxes are also not the solution."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence is for women who flee alone, almost for everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">When they arrive in Germany they are often traumatized.</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers a refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, the most up one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her small son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He was curious with big eyes curious in the room.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother moved to the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until they notice that it is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiled short and kissed the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene appears normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk to Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it is the business leader of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the subject of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are frozen.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich's north in one of the few decentralised accommodations for all women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">In January Condrobs opened up the establishment along with Pro Familia and the MÃ¼nchner women's aid.</seg>
<seg id="18">It has been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men do not exist - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here, has made experiences with sexual violence on their escape."</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee for war because they are politically pursued because they threaten torture or death, or because their families want them to send them as hoppers to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, there are other reasons for escape:" many steal secretly with them because they no longer see another way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honorary murders, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This continues it.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that tugs are calling for a bottle of water a sexual act, is not uncommon." ""</seg>
<seg id="29">"the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believe that the end, as soon as they anchor in Germany, irre, tells us."</seg>
<seg id="31">"again, the women in refugee camps would often be considered inferior and worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women who live in the accommodations in the Munich's north, appreciates them."</seg>
<seg id="33">Some of the children are certainly not optional.</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women were so accustomed to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they are often not going to help, there are more accommodations just for them."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"the question of whether it is of a similar project like Munich in its jurisdiction, answer some with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Oberpfalz and Oberfranken, there is no such thing in shelters of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"in Swabia alone, women are not found separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press secretary of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Unter- and Mittelfranken there are in some communal spaces or their own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Niederbayern, there are two central accommodation exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">The committee "rights of women and gender equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study which was published for the committee, it is said:" it is very important that men and women are separated. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if the privacy or women and women stay together, there may be - continued - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"the laundry rooms should be separated and easily accessible for women, stands in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women of this basic need is felt, one may be charged on the crush that there is at the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since itself has been talking about it, we have a long queue," says Bahr. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give up their hands, and to proclaim an official end to the eight months of long-term war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin takes his Turkish counterpart in the goldilded hall of St. Petersburg's palace in reception, I cannot defend myself that Ankara wants this reconciliation most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but plunge in the smiles was a malignant and barely radiant heat, even for its back-lasting conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I could no longer count.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but can even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day described a newspaper that Erdogan was so bending, as if never had something worst."</seg>
<seg id="11">I seemed to indicate the opposite rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cooling showed that the President of Russia had nothing to forget."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the contrary, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his quotes: the depreciation of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was sore.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared and accused Ankara to put Russia in his back.</seg>
<seg id="16">The failure was even bigger as it was committed by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">"to rebuild the cousin, it becomes difficult if not even impossible."</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the stately controlled media led a fierce, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at one time, it seemed that the Turks would blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations of leading officials, that Erdogan's own family from illegal oil trade in areas of Syria had benefited from the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg the official message, that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting occurred only because Putin has received apology from President Erdogan, who he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire lie clearly on the hand."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all friends he can get after spending the last month at a failed state dispute.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey tough - especially the charter of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has decreased by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, travel agents and charter companies will be facilitated when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">You are counting on a late seasonal onslaught on the Mediterranean.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week projected the state remote, fruit and vegetables, once the Turkish agrarian imported again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti makes it simple:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is angry in the West since its response to the tried to take power is considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued Groll come across the snow-empo of the EU's accession negotiations and Putin - the pierpike is to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian President he won surely a bonus that he tried to seek support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is well-known for Moscow, a matter of course, which itself has a deep fear of rain."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this glorious palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey, one as described in me a analyst once described," Alliance of outsiders ": two countries that are chased from the West and poorly treated and are now emerging."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference in Syria, where Moscow recently gave the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey can support antagonistic sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be noted that after almost three hours of initial discussions both president appeared at the press conference, they had not even striped the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey intentioned it to answer a question about their differences, while Putin decided to stress this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the light of the potential for a complete disaster, as NATO-member Turkey was abolishing the Russian battle, it is certainly better that the two heads of state speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="7">She supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsorship from the Six Nations Rugby to the Wimbledon winner Andy Murray.</seg>

<seg id="11">Ulster Bank is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.</seg>

<seg id="16">"now, I say that we do not pursue global objectives, but local objectives."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work under these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue its six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perception of different brands in his Sport-sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the Bank of brands, as we concentrate on inside (we asked) to make this a better Bank for customers?" said the chief executive. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"it would have been very cynical three years ago, if we had said that we will be a great bank for our customers and would have launched these marks."</seg>

<seg id="9">"on the web site of the Kremlin, it is said (in Russian) that he later was a protocol director and deputy director of the government."</seg>

<seg id="11">"" "I think that it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as a head of President in regard to legislative acts and checks for the implementation of your instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV stations on Friday with Ivanov asked to leave his post and have recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was a long time in one of the closest conspirators of Vladimir Putin, and as he works for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">As a rod he was one of the most powerful men of the country.</seg>

<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, who quoted on the website of the Kremlin," Ivanov "it is true that I asked you in early 2012 in a conversation with me this very complicated post - you could almost say - describe the job for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">Ivanov took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Before he was Deputy Prime Minister and Defence Minister.</seg>
<seg id="26">"he is a member of the Russian Security Council, and as Putin, former member of the State Security Council, KGB."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Council (FSB), who was appointed KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin was bored of his power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted."</seg>
<seg id="29">Once it was assumed that Ivanov could be president of Russia after Putin's second term as a third term coup against the Constitution.</seg>

<seg id="21">How does one monitor the loss of some 1300 cheap apartments whose support will be run over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="22">It will be 500 apartments alone until 2020.</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveler Ian Wright scht for a guide book his tongue at the dirty places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler subordinate his immune system and worgereflex for a serious examination - by doing some of the dirty and ekelest places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moderator and gutor Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk scrapped his course on a Euro-scarf, a railing at Piccadilly Circus, a sink knob of a train toilette and a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">In front of the leaks of each object he used a luminometer to show up and let us know what he will get.</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filtered under the title" "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength," brought some surprising results in daylight. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought, the dishwment of a train toilette blade, which was already used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more poor bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of gut bacteria, as well as his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left behind what he ableded, more than a bad night-aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Mr. Wright became known to test the viability of his intestine, traveled by the world and ate peculiar as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to train stations to flush pallets from toilets, the task placed his immune system definitely among a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he told:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about what my health concerns and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">In the film he was definitely up to his call.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the only thing he refused, was a dirty public toilet in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="14">His probationline showed a luminometry number of over 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">Compared to that the Luminomans are more fresh and less than 60.</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet that he refused to deviate, after their lumber's number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands are one of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturers of dairy products Valio produced the Reisefilm" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the bacterial number in different places such as the bathroom"</seg>
<seg id="18">"he says:" "it comes to the worst that I geroks in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing shearite than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not swallow here because it is indoors.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the Company stacked Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D in order to support the support of gut bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Vice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we wanted to offer the consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to watch and at the same time explains the benefits of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">"we brought crazy brainstormings that ended with it, that we said" Lass us Ian. "</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about products, we wanted to place them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with this documentary, we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way."</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think that the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who led the director of the film, added:" let me say so - I could have lost my respect for Ian, if he would have done some of the things that I have to instructed him, like the ekelty Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things where it was easier to bring Ian to leaks them and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad we recorded some of those dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in one of the survey conducted by 2015, 84 percent of all respondents carried out in particular with the wellness of gastroacid bacteria particularly with the wellness of stomach and intestine and 58 percent said they contain at least occasionally products that contain attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction of the construction work, starting at 5.30 am and only at 8 o'clock, there is no praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything quite cracky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the Jet Gas station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no transgressions.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved on the weekend of the half-time as scheduled to the south, until the end of October everything will be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"blessed will also be the disposal of those responsible for construction work, e.g. when it comes to setting homes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site started on Monday to the south, and the blockage of the AspergstraÃe in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again relaxed, the traffic situation is relaxed within the place."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now move from Ofterdingen from B 27 at the same time.</seg>

<seg id="12">"there were partly considerable complaints," "says the responsible management of the reengineering management of the responsible chief executive director Florian King."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the inhabitants of Bachman's road, SteinlachstraÃe, hafi Road and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many stentions were looking for and more familiar to their Navi trusted as the signage."</seg>

<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look in the maps.</seg>

<seg id="25">And in some points - in the unequal treatment of Gedsered for example - raises the question: what does that actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de MaiziÃ¨re, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, it cannot be said that the killings of Ansbach and WÃ¼rzburg were refugees."</seg>
<seg id="28">Many people in view of the high refugee flow are worried about safety.</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that are deeply employed people, have now not settled in election times even in election times."</seg>

<seg id="32">Then the attacks in WÃ¼rzburg and Ansbach.</seg>

<seg id="2">Lonely men's middle age love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the commentary box to reviewing him under the alias of non-leveling men with russian insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the multiplicity of sound plates is not attributable to a boom in millennials who wish to greet the reunion of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently purchased a record are all predictions after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most likely buyer."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes through Hobbycollectors - it has an emotional meaning: older plate tists retain their feelings for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy it to spend time (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog would be a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while in the midst of a busy road in Soho, a humble point, keep my hands and wild as:" so, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let us take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Sohos slowly comes to its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">"I would probably ask the cameraman to turn the camera for the next part in which I am in close proximity to various men in such shops, and try to assess their age and minds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I mean by Sister Ray (data number: two young women, three men middle age) into Reckless Records (data number, a woman, probably around the 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector that I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess it's already," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approximately 3,000 or 4,000 plates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this record, depicted on the top (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not return home), dress up the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he possesses a considerable number of albums and singles, the result of his available income: he is now able to buy plates that he could not afford as she appeared and again buy items that he sold, when he was young and pleaded."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70ies, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things where I probably was too young to buy them," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records, rather more introverted and gladly spend time, and add:" I don't smoke and I don't drink much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my loaster.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25 who works at Sister Ray, believes that many customers who meets the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he has also noticed a new wave of people that are influenced by the Medienhpe, people who have heard about the comeback, and set themselves to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually have taken away their collection in order to be emptied in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs, sell now their CDs to buy her records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of trailers of the plate of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional significance of plates?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes only a few seconds in a shop like phonica, to realize that record stores provides a soothing community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to WEZ, some of the older customers participated in the non-contact payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar soundboards, from objects that blissful Jugendermic appeals."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions, as a kind of consolation," says WEZ. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"this is with me as collectors, and I think that it is so many people."</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to get spiritually.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" flaps an employee from a record stack.</seg>
<seg id="35">"a survey conducted by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people bought a record from the last month, they have not yet heard."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey took also out that 41% have a record player that they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy a record, have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of news report, I would probably look very concerned as I bloom through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works in sounds of the Universe (data number: three men middle aged), has noticed one" trophy "of Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone only came here and said," "I do not have a record player, but I'd like to buy a radiohead record, so I can put it into the shelf," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less musiclones."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I have no record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older, which will come slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"stopover, dedicated to the gramophone almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience, when I go."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenager and women aged."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above shops - Wild Beasts newest synthesizers and sexstraddle pop, instead of experimental jazz, nods out of the loudspeakers - it's good to see such diversity among the customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks sunny, but wet mental traumas are hard to imagine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs for some minutes in the business and considers the variation of the plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It is more of a buzzling bumblebee as a large purchase.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it does not deserve much, therefore the collecting of plates is not a real option, it says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">It is easy to listen to music from a computer or other way but the beauty of plates is... "she drives with a loved disease.</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it really is unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the semblance of musts the jeans hotpants, I watched a group of young teenagers who are grouped for a moment to buy Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter contemplate, buy a crossover record."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left is a stairwell, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees it - maybe because they are only purely decorative, some are so far above that it is impossible to grasp them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record-art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items mean more money for the industry, and some customers could send into the depths of Sohos for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"there is no surprise that a population group that has more time and money than others, also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as boards."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research shows that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record business in Soho, the large number of female collectors and record owners who exist in reality, record stores and in Onlineforen."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with certainty not with the baking of records of Berwick Street and the leaves through plates, while they are steer the rigid view of an uncanny, 30-year-old moderator that rises nothing about the shoulders of the middle age."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, where thousands of refugees live."</seg>

<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who run the 72 provisional business, but admits that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais are absolutely comprehensible."</seg>

<seg id="2">The impressive performance of Britain at the 7-er Rugby came in the final on Thursday evening at a abrupt halt at the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were beaten up with a result of 43-7 at the Dec stage here in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji is shared a master class in the handling, side-Stepping, piping, line-run and roher strength to win gold - her first Olympic medal of any colour."</seg>

<seg id="5">"the strong defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could be dropped to them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">But irrespective of it Fiji would have taken part in this form a 15-man team.</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a tan morning will hang a gold medal to his neck: Fijis Cheftrainer Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon."</seg>

<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost at Ryan every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>

<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou squeezed through further weak Tailings of the GB team and rushed up to line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to a break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it's like Fiji was born to play the 7, while UK still falls."</seg>
<seg id="22">So it is also.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led basic changes to mid-time by and closed the fijic gap... for whole four minutes, which was good for the conditions of the first half-time, to Joshua Tuisova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton launched an attempt for GB, made a touch-down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game worked for a long time in favor of the South-einsulans, whose fans sang, flags shout and danced on the bleachers."</seg>

<seg id="4">"even if it was only the two who sat at the Ruder, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was all present as they ruined for the second Olympiad in two without any tax wife, who used the first women in the history of British Sports that had such a scale."</seg>

<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediability of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams who spent a nerve wrecking tomorrow to talk something more than usual and thus tried to process its own fears."</seg>

<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, therefore a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up with their opponents.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even during the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark had started up, Stanning and Glover had much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>

<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out of making something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we did not want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race as we did."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the singing has made Ursel Kipp already their whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the teacher study she defeated the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old in a senior choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing me - emotional and physically," describe them. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a sample, it feels balanced, cheerful and altogether more lively, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"right next, they do something good in their health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"for Singen is equal from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler from the German population of seniors."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people's joy in music, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">Being regular exercise can tie and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures emerge in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience also has made Ursel Kipp in her choir: to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense - says Hackler.</seg>
<seg id="12">For here they are practicing a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Who regularly asks his lungs as well as everyday life is not as fast as the Puest.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even if it is about getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>

<seg id="16">"in the older generations the joint Singen had a much higher priority, it was part of everyday life, both at school and in leisure time."</seg>
<seg id="17">Lenz is often observed that the singing or hearing of songs in older people arouses many memories often associated with positive feelings of their adolescent age.</seg>
<seg id="18">Through Liedtexte and especially tunes herself denied or denied people back for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="19">"when singing the head is also required for a special power, says Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">At the same time concentrate on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and to adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge.</seg>
<seg id="21">"just older people who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on herself."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that one learns through the singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Also the self-esteem grows by the singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show themselves: when I go for a long time, I will better and alert over myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start with the singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby, should not hesitate - even if he means a little talent, betraying Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who hears it, when a sound goes on it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">Looking for the right offer have seniors various opportunities, says Hackler. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"sings someone from the acquaintances in a seniors, you can simply connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer views of choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">"who wants to sing in a church choir, can contact the church or the church leader."</seg>
<seg id="33">Many elderly people can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"who has no access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbours may ask for help with the internetreche."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we see at the 'identity movement' locking points for efforts against the freedom of democratic basic order," said Constitutional Court Hans-Georg Maate the German Press Agency in Berlin. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"thus, the immigrant Islamic faith or the Middle East will be diffused in extremist fashion."</seg>
<seg id="5">That's why we are seeing the movement as well.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the" identity movement "is a grouping with French roots, which has been active in Germany since 2012."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it turns against" Multikulti-Wahn, "" uncontrolled mass immigration and the "loss of one's own identity by trangement." "</seg>
<seg id="8">"Concentralist in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - watch the" "identity". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maate said, his authority was closely coordinated with the offices in the decision."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups such as the 'identity movement' attempt to pick their target group where it stands," said the Constitutional Court. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general, they attempt to address them with youthful language, often with stuffed music."</seg>
<seg id="12">Islamists are as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is not useful advertising for your own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are very vulnerable in a special way.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"recently, from several federal states he had given reports about the contacts of the" identity "to Afales politicians."</seg>
<seg id="18">"and Maate said, he did not have a knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for constitutional protection, potential contact of this species can only be relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the particular party - in this case the AfD - by certain individuals, the extremist, their targets and becomes so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such people controlled controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view of the marked increase of legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugees said Maate, he would not yet speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But we have noticed in recent years that it can give right-frozen structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Friday group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it can be quite sure that further legitimate groupings or small groups form, the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugees or attacks from other far right-right motivations."</seg>
<seg id="27">A German-wide or European-wide control of lawsuits is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups have emerged at the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"concerned, Maate expressed that many attacks on the account of men went, which had not appeared before in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">Many of the suspects in the attacks on asylum seekers have not previously been known as criminals, politically motivated criminal offenders or supporters of the right scene. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many people have thus committed crimes that previously had nothing to work with right-wing extremists who were perhaps politically indifferent, or have voted for example CDU, SPD or left, which then have been radicalised by far-right-wing voting."</seg>

<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have drawn criticism in the past criticised that the app Blackface is shaped or white skin as beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as this week I proposed a filter that gave them slipped, false teeth and inflated cheeks, there were some critics a racist caricature of Asians."</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked whether these repetitive controversies referred to a larger problem that the company has with diversity.</seg>

<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a homage to anime characters and not as a cartoon by Asians.</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, they are the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are continually feeling, inescapable of, a rapid season between the competition and the pursuit."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself would be a burning stick, which is passed by the wristwatch for swimmers to the turers to the triathlete."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't switch the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbors in the queue in Coffeeshop, without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Lev or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who is for the first time at the Olympic Games and a female's warm with dimples, could have certainly be sent under these known names, built by sponsors and wellbeing TV advertising if he would be a swimmers, Turner or even fencer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights in the olympic trampoline for gold."</seg>
<seg id="9">The olympic flame does not lit any event straight away.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partially in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: air brush, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the flipper and may have dominion for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I'd make modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charme of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has already been a olympic event since 2000, when it had his debut in Sydney, the last 16 years had been so sparse that many that I asked, did not know that it is at all a Olympiasportart."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes for competition, it has never won a coin on a trampoline and had an athlete until 2012, which it has made up to the final."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and Russians tend to share their prizes for the men and the Chinese and Canadian ans for women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on a trampoline has a certain outsider charme, partly because it sounds appropriate for the unresolved ear for a clown school than those for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point I should admit that I am not an expert, but only a sublime enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humorous potential - the kartoonous trembling of his never to end cloudy - but also the Grazie of the athletic and diving, the two sports that is essentially united."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winner jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (rotating, lifting and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympics, they are evaluated according to the execution, difficulty of difficulty and" "flight time". ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"two-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, are in Rio to compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight on straight.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists hoped in their quest for gold, faster, upwards and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and back, upwards and downwards on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"it is not only the ornamental or curb, but also a further height in the TV transfer: that of the world or the Olympiarekord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the target-oriented quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatical - and it's enough to even stir a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I don't have to look at the look of these games as something.</seg>
<seg id="30">This trampoline offers a reprieve.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forwards movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she jumped off, apparently weightless as an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly back upwards."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here, there is a competition, of course, not without difficulty, but during exercise, there is no hectic attack on the target, no arching in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It can be as Zen as the competition in the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and Endrons of women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the Streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; most of the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will shine as part of a night block at both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely overlooked in general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">If the awareness increase only through the anxiety and the lens of male athletes can be reached - as it suggested the male U.S. Turner according to The Wall Street Journal - then Mr Dooley expects his after air rinses, new fans. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators demanded that political changes in Ethiopia call on violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that zig protesters were killed during clashes with the police officers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia going to be together?</seg>
<seg id="6">"during the last ten years, one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid foe of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">But in the last months protests against the government the country and they spread to more and more areas.</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people flooded into the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">The government's response was unmerciful to human rights organisations.</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses gave to that police officers were killed on unarmed demonstrators and killed.</seg>
<seg id="11">"changing videos about the protests that probably are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how safety men have young people with staves, while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The leader of the UN High Authority on Human Rights is now calling for an outgoing investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold up this country and in the future it will be even harder," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa to Nigeria and its stability is appreciated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopian economy was expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commule in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"if Ethiopia has been anything but a role model for democracy - human rights organisations, constantly led the repression of the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, with dissidents effective to silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">Many were sent into exile or imprisoned in exile or carried out in the wilderness of the desert.</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you press people and these no other options have to protest besides, it breaks out," "said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopian."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the ground-use to the worms with respect to the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition, and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, the tensions along the border to Eritrea is rising; a fight for this jagged, controversial primarily demanded in June hundreds of lives."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analytics fear fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, which have been more or less imposed in recent years, which could exploit turbulence and armed again."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of provocation after years of going ahead of self-energized under the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first one seems harmless: smart phones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, very many Ethiopians had been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones have become more frequent and improved the internet services."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government has access to Facebook and Twitter, what they do at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies who conceal where they are staying."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians gave them their protests to protect themselves.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity among the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnicities in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons prosperized the Amharas, which come from Ethiopia, predominantly Christian highlands, in politics and economics, while they exploit the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in flat-areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this also changes.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a screen," "Mulatu Gemechu said, a leader of the Oromos."</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests were held in areas of the Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which constitute around 6 percent of the population and which are dominant in the military, in the intelligence agencies, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was until his death at a non-publicized disease in 2012 17 years of Ethiopian prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts are saying that he was particularly well versed in using early signs of dissatisfaction and special officers to process enemies and make them inharmful.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime is lacking in this fundamental step," Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new prime minister, Hailemaritime am Desalegn, was chosen for relatively unattended reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray Region of the north of Ethiopian, lord of Haiti is coming from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analyst must say that he enjoys not the confidence of the safety services controlled by the Tigray control services.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time, Ethiopia was in such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections had been protested by the government, according to the data of Analytikders, apparently stolen by the government and were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raid, many protesting were killed even if it were less than in the last months, and this time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts of Ethiopian leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new pendulum line, as well as for their measurable progress in fighting poverty."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal abnormalities of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesting in Gondar, an amharani city, of Tigray guided shops and the hatred towards the tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analyst tell that the protests brought the U.S. and other western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even if it recently claimed that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his allies in an already volatile area collapses."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin Gratcher."</seg>

<seg id="4">"it also brings his collaborators, who make an effort to take him during an eventful phase in protection to explain in the peculiar position, statements that he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after he had made the hint at a voting event on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump made in relation to the claim on Thursday and consisted in interviews that he really did not intended to indicate the president and Mrs. Clinton had ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday said Mr. Trump, he was just sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was opposed to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation entirely seriously."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help remove the statement somewhat mitigate the statement by asking him to destroy it, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of the critique was blaze down to Mr. Trump. while he tries to direct the focus of his campaign because of random fracture on the economic situation.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about speeches for the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried again to return to this topic."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinon's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech bored."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he attracted strong criticism as he said, the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clint's emails, but later he said," "Of course, I said the sarcastically."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to move the language boundaries in politics and then back to ruin.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of its methods to test how certain messages are recorded by his fans, as they arrive, and then if necessary" clarify "according to how the reaction goes." "Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"however, I also believe it is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of putting the tone to the presidential elections, Mr. Trump has assumed more than its tone, since its survey values are further declined."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a lead with great lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-on-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump in general seeks to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accused his critics to distort his statements or to understand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is strengthening the attention of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trumps Scherze have brought his loyal co-shonites into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former Mayor of New York and one of the most famous traint builders, gave great effort to defend the candidates today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says is legitimate, political comments, so he said Mr. Giuliani was asking him to the correctness of Mr. Trumps's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called her back-backers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he pulled off the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government was served under Obama, in the Mrs. Clinton as an outdoor Minister, it was allowed to spread out the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events in Pennsylvania, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and cast them before them to ride on any of his words and be taken against him."</seg>

<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">GrÃ¶nlandsharks usually only appear in the winter to the surface.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an examination on board the Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and swims with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic Ocean until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">GrÃ¶nlandhaie got only with 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely crossing the Greenland shark at the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it reaches an average of just 1.220 meters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meters long animal speeds up to 2,6 km / h - and is half as fast as a rob with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, this of a long-term lifestyle seems to be a silver bullet for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report on" "Science" "at any rate from a Greenland shark that could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," said Alexander Scheuthanlein from the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means for vertebrates a world record. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"admittedly, the evolution of evolution has long been that Greenland-haie is stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only missing the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland-haie are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the polar sea before the skinned coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Spitsbergen."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperature around the six degrees Celsius, they usually dive at the surface mostly only in winter."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, about the lifestyle of Greenland-haie knowledge researchers have little knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their contemporation measures them, when they calculated six animals with a transmitter."</seg>
<seg id="18">"loot make this sharks nevertheless: in the stomach of an animal found researchers the remains of a robe, a different had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly hunt them sleeping animals or patrolled at the bottom of the ice cream and look carcasses who torches from higher water layers downstairs.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Julius Nielsen and his colleagues studied 28 Greenland-haie, the fishermen between 2010 and 2013 at Greenland or Svalbard as a convent from the depth of the North Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the biggest 502 centimetres."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they reviewed with the carbon-14 method of the sharks of the sharks."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens starts already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein are no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had strikingly much carbon-14 in the linsenders.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, their birth should therefore lie in the early 1960s, as nuclear weapons encaptive greater quantities of this radioactive carbon carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens has opposed a low surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is likely to have celebrated his 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">All the larger Greenland-haie had normal carbon-14 quantities in their Linsenders against the normal carbon-14 quantities created by cosmic radiation in the atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14-clock features a 493 centimeters long Greenland shark an age of 335 years, during the record-shark with 502 centimeters, even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark female only got up, if they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers could assign a age to age.</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimetres probably passed on the threshold to the sexually mature and his age with 156 years was determined, GrÃ¶nlandhaie with the multiplication obviously weighs at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This should also be the case for vertebrates at this time world-clord.</seg>
<seg id="33">That such methusaleme live primarily in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"also the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland-whale, in whose speck at the neck a 120 years old Harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism also runs on austerity."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and then slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often particularly large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because volume grows faster than its surface, by which the animal is heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram is therefore much bigger than with a grams of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have less enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as early as possible as possible as possible as possible," explains the evolution of evolution. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"in contrast, a very large animal should invest more in a long life on the other hand."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was likely to be inhabitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of the NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could once have occurred with its hot, waterproof surface and CO2-dense atmosphere once again."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously suggested that slow reversal of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, the latest simulation points out that Venus could have had a thin, erdsimilar atmosphere and nevertheless slowly revolved."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet is thought to be more dry areas than the earth, but once enough water and geographic variability once had to live life and put them in front of a rapid deforestation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus benefited also from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation exponentially exponentially off their daily side of the Sun almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain, which creates a thick layer, creates what an umbrella appears to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the result is average temperatures, which are some degree of cooler than that of the Earth today."</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that was similar to evolution that was previously thought of Planetary research.</seg>
<seg id="14">Although she was probably inhabitable the Venus -- in the course of several billions years --added heat and ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was blown away by the ultra-violet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydration, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained at carbon dioxide with a fatal greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know them today."</seg>

<seg id="18">"22 per cent of the German companies affected by Ransomware, 13 per cent even had to break the operations completely, in one case people were aware of life."</seg>

<seg id="23">The hackers again know this and try to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a current study the safety researchers from F-Secure the utility areas and the contact with the blackmailers examines and come to the result: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service, in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims by chat, as they can pay by Bitcoin, direct accessible support sites, or decode for free example files."</seg>

<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky profits from the ransomware blackmail, the hacker will become more professional and share the work, explains the security expert Chester Wisniewski of Antivirus-vendor Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week.

<seg id="31">"the package includes a adaptation tool, so that smaller configurations, appearance and branding can be changed," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="32">The blackmasts are then looking for more hackers in order to spread the freshly introduced software among the victims.</seg>
<seg id="33">We live in a service sector.</seg>

<seg id="35">Payment is made per annated machine.</seg>
<seg id="36">"usually overtake the criminals then spammer with the spread," says Wisniewski. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"by now, the risk of Ransomware is now known by many companies that better secure their data."</seg>
<seg id="38">"over 50 percent of companies IT leaders in the Malwarebytes survey will trust that Ransomware can repel off, by file-back-ups and scannersoftware."</seg>
<seg id="39">"accordingly, the perpetrators are already pursuing new strategies."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful fatigue more, the perpetrators are instead responsible for the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing," explains Malwarebytes-Chef Marcin Kleczynski. "</seg>

<seg id="9">What is behind sleeves?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there may be organic, mental or behavioral factors, but also medications."</seg>
<seg id="12">Not rare is the sleeping disorder expression of another disorder.</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early it is up to all during a depression," "says Wewoe."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors would like together.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who for example has a slipped disk, can lie down badly, wake up every two to three hours and begins to greet, about everyday problems and -to greet, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you pay with sleeping disorders to the doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who is not well versed over a period of one month in at least three nights per week, and the day is compromised, should go to the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="19">"impairment can look quite different: it is tired, tired, undisturbed sleep, has difficulty with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has moods or physical discomfort as stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate the disorder, it is important to find out the causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options come among other things, behaviour changes, an cognitive behavioural therapy or even medication - classic inclinations only in an emergency and most up for two weeks - inquired."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any rainfall available in Germany, Prof. Ingo Fietze, Head of the interdisciplinary centre at the CharitÃ© University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore one should consult with sleep problems initially at the primary care physician,"</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clear up with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for the examination in the sleeping laboratory, it is an example of snoring with respiratory sufferings, in disease-sickness, at sleeping-time, or if you fail to find the cause of a sleepy disorder."</seg>
<seg id="27">You really do not have to prepare for the study.</seg>
<seg id="28">One should spend the day normally.</seg>

<seg id="31">"therefore, it was also so important that the inhabitants left their road: from the police, the politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the interpretation of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants like Neugebauer, the road will continue to take away: by precarious reconstructions in the former building blocks, which throng the old inhabitants."</seg>

<seg id="1">Urbach: Annika Deuschle is new refugees</seg>
<seg id="2">Annika Deuschle is the contact person in the field of integration and organizer.</seg>
<seg id="3">"moreover, it is a social worker on site."</seg>
<seg id="4">"since July Annika Deuschle, the refugee officers for Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="5">The Social-Educational team supports the management of the Achim Grockenberger.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she sees itself as a contact for all players: refugees, the work of refugee camps, administration, authorities and who else."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working circle indicates that the volunteer is more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the experience Wollmichsau, which has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less spotting than on the multitude of desire areas would be focused - meant, when administration wanted to write the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"searched for was a administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-term experience in the field of social work, just an insisted Wollmichsau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, Annika Deuce."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people, and also behind the scenes as well as network inactivity."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been doing this for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position on three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle Ehrlich and full-time actors are supported. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small issues, organizational, human and insurrectional problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon new containers are available in the washing road</seg>
<seg id="17">"a serious problem has been recognized for some time, apartments for connecting units, which have been acknowledged."</seg>
<seg id="18">For the interconnection the municipalities are responsible.</seg>
<seg id="19">You must accommodate the refugees in their own or rented apartments.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must carry the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility will change from the store in the Commune and job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every owner wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been proven to be very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">There is no need for administration of private apartments.</seg>
<seg id="25">"you have so far failed to rely on private apartments, so Deuster."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common apartments must be seen as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so, new containers will soon be placed in the washing road."</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="30">"besides a fixed lead, they are internships, educational places, school courts, one-euro jobs and assistance activities for refugees and migrants who need to be fandable or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help master master, do charitable work - and this motivates and very orderly, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that working for the community to become a positive activity.</seg>
<seg id="34">This is "no employment therapy."</seg>
<seg id="35">"however, activity means not only work."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a fixed structure, say deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People must develop a sense of awareness.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so there will be offers such as sports, contacts with native people and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">So you can also jump to manage and volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="41">"it is central that the refugees get the feeling, they are welcome and welcome in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must declare to the refugees that it just takes and they can make the time useful to bridge, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who eventually develop the feeling, he could not help in Urbach anyone, should not work and be unprofitable, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"however, problem incidents there are also, says the customer honest," "people where nothing goes." "the work of Deuschle and customer is therefore always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: have the two happenings in fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," says Regine customer quite clearly, "what some could call naive". "a resisiko could and doesn't want to exclude them."</seg>
<seg id="50">"sensitizes be the helper, but already."</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the killings bring them completely into temptation.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"so, the main and volunteers have to be held on-site and in the region to activities."</seg>
<seg id="56">"in doing so, they always have in the background that soon a new peak of refugees and migrants would come to Urbach."</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need an upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">This is clearly to answer this question.</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we have not yet arrived, where we would like to go," says Annika Deuschle. "</seg>
<seg id="61">No new refugees who would be able to relax.</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes it clear that the Urbacher shall also be laughed heavily up to the previous men.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently some 100 people, mostly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they need to help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complex, there is no simple answers."</seg>
