Obama receives a Netanyahu
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to speak about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Teheran &apos;s destabil@@ ising action in the Middle East .
&quot; but it is also a question of the conflict with the Palestinians , and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Netanyahu has been curious for years .
Washington critic@@ ises the ongoing settlement of Israel and jects a lack of action when it comes to the peace process .
&quot; through the deal of President , the deal struck by the Iranian nuclear programme has deterior@@ ated the relationship between the two . &quot;
&quot; in March , Netanyahu had held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Republi@@ can Congress who was partly referred to as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken to Obama , a meeting had rejected this agreement with regard to the im@@ min@@ ent election in Israel . &quot;
call a call for Professor to have shot his girlfriend
&quot; in an emergency , Professor Sh@@ annon was represented with a somewhat timi@@ d voice of the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; he &apos;s important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; but still live and probably excited is , and he said the family contacts of dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; within the house the officials found the bodies of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a handmade note that I loved on a white block : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I could make it , I loved Amy and she is the only woman who loved me . &quot;
&quot; there was no notice that he was represented in two online tracks for the Delta State University in Cle@@ veland , Mississippi , who had already travelled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he shot up to his office for information by the police , Fre@@ ane Schmidt , who killed and killed at his office . &quot;
Delta State University of Poli@@ draw Bu@@ ford said that univers@@ es did the shooting at 10 : 18 clock .
he said that he had taken the fatal emergency call at some point afterwards .
&quot; until the end of the day there was another death : lamb took the life , when the police declared him . &quot;
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ tur@@ ers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get an idea of what he motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details that were published by the investig@@ ators in the two ends of the state , as well as what students and collaborators who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were rejo@@ iced in his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , he did not have history of violence or a criminal history . &quot;
&quot; he was written in a book written by him in his written book , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both erected in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty members are 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
at the same time there were some tendencies towards problematic behavi@@ ors .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised himself , he also seemed a little excited and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mi@@ u Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb told him that he had to do with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; &apos; previously , the Delta State University had asked for a reading of health reasons and said he had some health problems any more . &quot;
during this year he set up only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the employment policy of the university are significant that the promotion , for whom he had worked so hard , for him could not be a guarantee for an automatic route to a job as Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; he said William La@@ For@@ ge , he did not know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
they are all questions that he cannot answer .
&quot; after the flight from the campus , the police later took a Lam@@ bs track , when he returns to Mississippi with Arkan@@ s@@ as import . &quot;
&quot; before he was arrested , he over@@ took home with an .@@ 38 cali@@ ber of P@@ ist@@ ols in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile @-@ south of his parents home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Mississippi ; Washington County Cor@@ met Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still running in the entrance .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why I went to this house , but Johnson said that he knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
Lamb grew in the area .
&quot; represented in 2009 his work at the University , which has 3.@@ 500 students in a city with around 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and was taught ge@@ ology and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he graduated in spring in pedago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the many years of friend@@ ships lam@@ bs him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; she said , she was 15 and lamb was 20 when they met through mutual friends . &quot;
she and her friends were in High School and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her guitar playing .
he was then of the lady &apos;s warm .
&quot; all the girls mel@@ ted , if he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson suburbs of Brand@@ on . &quot;
represented and d@@ ants were obviously quite some time together .
&quot; in the emergency , I said &quot; &quot; I have killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate from a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog called Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the back@@ stone house , that adjacent to a bath in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was in order .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ ste@@ en , said they were fallen 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was now 19 years old . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , he &apos;s never met , but due to his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that he was interested in music and he played blues . &quot;
met Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail did last three years ago both on a summer market .
&quot; later , they played together one or the other . &quot;
&quot; o &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings her own music . &quot;
ins@@ ss was a nurse responsible for various companies on @-@ line .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ man eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak illuminated area near Gau@@ tier , said that he &apos;s honoured and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night on the Night of September 5 , for the last time , after he had ended with a sp@@ herical audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the stor@@ ero@@ oms and cried to one another .
&quot; I mean , they both had a good sense for jo@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the mon@@ gre@@ ener seminar programme and specialized on American natives and own colonial history , said Don All@@ an Mitchell , a English professor at the school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the Stu@@ dents Committee .
&quot; the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ veland took part in the Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ tur@@ ers , associates , students and members of the community at a candle @-@ light commemor@@ ative event . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt took part at the Mah@@ n@@ Guard , while the university &apos;s &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; amazing grace &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students to return , &quot; said La@@ ws . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
Amy and Ro@@ gel@@ io Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ veland , Mississippi . &quot;
&quot; associated Press authors Em@@ ily Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Mississippi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to re@@ proo@@ fing that the police now says that he killed Schmidt , and that lamb was rejected in his emergency ad@@ ence though his wife , but there is no notice that the two ever got married . &quot;

it was remarkable also for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat beside me is empty , and it will gradually realise that Princess Diana is sitting next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; back in Time . &quot; &quot;

UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; ban K@@ i @-@ moon , Secretary @-@ General , Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says , his response to Russia has increased military support for Syria : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of almost five years of conflict , and more weapons will wor@@ sen power and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN Chief demands once again all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to uni@@ fy and inclusive negotiations for finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban on Wednesday said a press conference held on Wednesday that he is planning to meeting the foreign ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - United States , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the br@@ ink of the Ministers meeting held next month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ ts that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation in@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in addressing the crisis in Syria , having proved it in achieving nuclear De@@ als with Iran . &quot;
8 survey values showing that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious to take .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have de@@ done him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans are trying to draw Donald Tr@@ ump from the top R@@ ates in surveys , it has not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate . &quot;
of course it is too early in the election period .
neither claims that Tr@@ ump will likely win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts say that in 2011 , Rick Per@@ r@@ y &apos;s leadership was issued on the rising Herman Cain respectively , none of which has only won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
&quot; but external lateral brack@@ ets like Je@@ zi@@ b &apos;s Super PAC and the conservative Economic Group Club for Growth now recognize Tr@@ umps of per@@ sever@@ ance and begin to let their dollar flow , in order to overthrow him . &quot;
here are some current survey values that suggest that real estate is not just a temporary phase :
significant exposure levels have turned around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth @-@ University showed that only two of ten Re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate bo@@ gu@@ l . &quot;
by the middle of July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six out of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures remain in early states .
a Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in Iowa has found last week that 60 percent of re@@ public@@ ans have a good idea of tr@@ ump .
two thirds of GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with p@@ umping as a candidate .
&quot; in a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c last week 67 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans , they would be either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if tr@@ ump would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he would be the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son might say about the same enthusiasm as tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent , who say the same about tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next thing in the matter of excitement ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say that they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if Je@@ zi@@ b Bush , the favorite establishment , the candidate would become a candidate . &quot;
a majority of Re@@ public@@ ans sees very m@@ umps of temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely ised for his bom@@ bas@@ tic and insul@@ ting statements , 52 per cent of people believe in real temper@@ ament as the real temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post is held on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number holds out in the first pre @-@ state of the nation , the State of Iowa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think he has the personality for an Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , according to Quin@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 per cent , that he did not have the personality to effectively perform his ministry , and almost six out of 10 Independent can say that his tem@@ per is not going into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
if they put their nest @-@ ke@@ epers , can hold Republi@@ can voters Tr@@ ump for real . &quot;
&quot; if you are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , say , after a survey of CN@@ N / Or@@ c from the past week four out of ten that Tr@@ ump will be the best bet . &quot;
it &apos;s a change since the time when four of ten end of July put their money on E@@ b Bush .
complete disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at this time in the last cycle , four of ten Re@@ public@@ ans had thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination against only 28 % for the final candidates Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear that a variety of GO@@ P &apos;s voters can be viewed as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even when the re@@ public@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump makes it almost everybody . &quot;
some experts indicate that the frag@@ mented field is likely to contribute to trace guidance while the anti @-@ tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tr@@ ump will be ern@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; before C@@ early Fior@@ ina , he earned 13 points , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , prior to Walker 15 points , before Ev@@ b Bush 19 points and finally before edge Paul , John Ka@@ himself and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ on @-@ head race with Ted Cruz .
the only candidate who proposes him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneurs with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ on @-@ head race .
a scarce majority of Donald @-@ Tr@@ ump @-@ fans tells that they have formed their opinion .
&quot; a new survey conducted by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday showed that only a little more than half the elec@@ tors , who support tr@@ ump in order to forgive their voices . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said that they let the door open in order to switch to other candidates .
&quot; however , Tr@@ umps is strong competition at the moment of the other out@@ sider , neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as often for trace . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say , that they match with tear at the issue of immigration . &quot;
&quot; since then Donald Tr@@ ump in his election campaign was called for two months immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ist , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in public discourse in 2016 . &quot;
some are ap@@ prehen@@ sive that the bom@@ bas@@ tic utter@@ ance of tr@@ ump key Hisp@@ ano Americans will keep away from the Republi@@ can party and re@@ acting the renewed efforts .
but after the new ABC / post survey of Monday about six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans that they agree with tear at questions of migration .
&quot; so long that immigration remains in the spotlight , Donald Tr@@ ump will seem to do too . &quot;
the frustration of the government climbed up to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son falls by now about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , mainly due to their out@@ sider status . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 Re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry with Washington .
&quot; a survey of D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Bloomberg in Iowa only two weeks ago shows that three out of four Iowa public@@ ans are frustrated by the re@@ public@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; heard . &quot;
Munich - Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive living in Germany
here is the most expensive apartment complex - with a view over the North se@@ e@@ za .
&quot; in the street , it costs an square meter of a cage @-@ house in the cut 7@@ 3.@@ 300 . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is natural , it is said in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special layers are one square meter at most costs .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for one student in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top @-@ cultivation , one the price does not appear like pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the Real Estate provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a list of the most exclusive German locations - with square footage at di@@ zing heights .
&quot; there are sometimes tens of tens of thousands of Euro , -@@ per square meter . &quot;
but good to who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way , Munich is sometimes not at the top here . &quot;
Champions League : Bayern @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Gö@@ tz@@ e
doubt Tor@@ ry in Piraeus : Bavaria @-@ Star Thomas Müller has a run .
a lucky winner of Thomas Müller succes@@ sively the FC Bayern will the way to a deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ac@@ os Piraeus - then it ran .
a sovereign start @-@ up of the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e have earned the FC Bayern in the Hex@@ en@@ closure of Piraeus a dream start into the &quot; mission of Milan . &quot; &quot;
the team of trainer P@@ ep Gu@@ ardi@@ ola won their premium play in the Champions League at the Greek record master Olympi@@ ac@@ os in a hot atmosphere thanks to Mü@@ llers Double Asia ( 5@@ 2. / 90@@ th + 2 ) and i@@ tz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
the twel@@ fth edition of success in series is to be the first step towards the final on 28 May 2016 in Italy where Gu@@ ardi@@ ola will finally take the hen @-@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt .
Müller received awards for his 28th place in the Champions League for Bavaria &apos;s tour of the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Tor@@ ah Roberto which had to happen as a stro@@ ke of the grand@@ master .
&quot; we won &apos;t be underestimated , &quot; had Bavaria @-@ captain Philip Lah@@ m before the game in the Kar@@ am@@ k@@ akis @-@ stadium in front of 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich &apos;s sentence held . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
&quot; Piraeus had gained his latest six home games in the top class , among them the famous clubs as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ tico Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
2011 also stum@@ bled here Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
they went brave to work with their offen@@ sive efforts but often in vain .
the attacks were often initiated by mal@@ shift on Link@@ ed@@ gas Douglas Costa introduced to the former Braunschwei@@ g Omar El@@ ab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i .
Müller had more luck far from the right side than his flan@@ k flo@@ cked out of the right place in the left corner .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half an had Robert Le@@ af@@ ov@@ sky .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os lin@@ ux Ide@@ ye Brown proposed the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then with direct inspection , the go@@ alie Roberto with the knee was par@@ ted ( 3@@ 5th ) . &quot;
&quot; although Bavaria was used to play a dominant game , Piraeus could put a con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous con@@ i@@ che . &quot;
on Tor@@ ac@@ ter Manuel Neu@@ er but wet .
&quot; so , when he establishes a shot of ide@@ ye on the inter@@ viewer ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola captured a four @-@ class with David Al@@ aba in the centre of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng that made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Gö@@ tz@@ e , after muscular problems back in the Ka@@ der , sat first outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero was given only after the final training given in the green light , &quot; said Sport@@ vor@@ es Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; he who wants to make something different from it , this is already mal@@ ign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; even at the first change , Gu@@ ardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought David King@@ sle@@ y Com@@ an for the la@@ wed Le@@ af@@ ov@@ sky ( 5@@ 9th ) . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ tz@@ e arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vid@@ al ( 7@@ 6th ) and made 13 minutes later everything clearly , by El@@ f@@ m Müller appointed Müller yet . &quot;
in front of the game it had come to Kra@@ w@@ alle in the stadium .
&quot; after a smaller group of partially exploited Bavaria fans in her audience block obviously the supporters of Hosts , Piraeus with words and gest@@ ures had prov@@ oked the security forces and went with hi@@ ves against the Munich followers . &quot;
at least one of Bavaria was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk to lose teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , cuts not only the lung , but also its teeth - this is a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : in ren@@ unciation the risk is fast .
smokers have a significantly higher risk to losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is derived from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ RE@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers have reduced the risk of losing their teeth prematurely in order to reduce the 2.@@ 5@@ - up to 3.@@ 6 times higher . &quot;
the scientists had watched over 23@@ 300 subscri@@ bers .
&quot; primary causes for spro@@ uting , c@@ aries and inflammation of the g@@ um line , acc@@ entu@@ ates the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
smoking a risk factor for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis is stress the authors .
the connection between smoking and dental de@@ ity therefore go back to more frequent tooth fl@@ aps at smokers .
to what extent smoking is also the risk of dental c@@ aries increases .
&quot; people who hearing up smoking could reduce their risk but within a short amount of time , the researchers would write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the threat is back to the level of non @-@ smokers , S@@ hab@@ tor Thomas Diet@@ rich from the English university Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; should people be persu@@ aded to become non @-@ smokers , the student leader H@@ einer Boeing from DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shortened the lifetime . &quot; &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for lungs and vessels , and according to our findings also leads to good dental health to high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany over 20 percent of the population is affected by dental violence in the age of 65 to 74 years , the DI@@ f@@ E was divided . &quot;
earlier studies have already pointed out that smoking is the risk of early car@@ ving reduced .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ p@@ ates the findings .

EU Commission strikes a new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; &quot; &quot; to increase the dispute over the planned transatlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the EU Commission has proposed an extensive reform of the current arbitration system . &quot;
&quot; according to the controversial private arbitration institutions , for disputes between companies and states , they are said to be replaced by a more transparent system which clearly corresponds with more traditional dishes in its function . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that trust citizens , &quot; &quot; stated the Commissioner for Commissioner Cecilia Malm@@ ström today . &quot;
the Swedish has ahead to launching the proposal as a European parliamentary commission in the free @-@ trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the largest free trade zone of the world will be developed with 800 million people . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; plans to reform the current arbitration proceedings deal with regard to the fact that the EU states and the US can jointly elect independent judges for a new investment courts . &quot;
&quot; they should come to equal parts from the EU , the US and to third countries . &quot;
this is intended for the first time also a second instance .

&quot; until now , the procedures involved stand up among other arbitr@@ ators , a restriction option against their judg@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of recent months , it has become clear that citizens did not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fairness and justice , commented Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to go down according to your own information on the International Investment Programme . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , also disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clarified . &quot;
&quot; primarily , the investor @-@ state arbitration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) above all were considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional tri@@ bun@@ als are critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parall@@ el@@ on by opponents , which affect the companies &apos; contam@@ in@@ ers of tax@@ payers , national laws or a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first , anti @-@ TTIP organisations such as Camp@@ act , the proposals from the European Commission are insufficient . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it was particularly critici@@ zed that they are not intended to apply for the already negotiated agreement with Canada ( CE@@ TA ) . &quot;
the German economic secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) continued the plans for a great step forward .
&quot; the Commission considered among the reform significant points , the Federal Minister of Sig@@ mar Gabriel brought out from the spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbitration was taken from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European company association B@@ US@@ IN@@ ES@@ S@@ EURO@@ PE warned against cur@@ bing the accus@@ ations of economics by too many new rules .
particularly small and medium enterprises could be contacted by this .
&quot; when the talks on TTIP TTIP ( Transatlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) , it was further unclear . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investors &quot; protection has not been discussed with the United States so far . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was already at the end of this year . &quot;

Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ ns de@@ debut in the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister
since his election Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut in the prime minister of the prime minister eager@@ ly anticip@@ ating tension
the new leader Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n will be his debut in the Prime Minister and made his debut with David Cameron for the first time .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to submit the first of his six pre @-@ given questions shortly after noon while his performance was probably tested by the media and the Labour MEPs from close proximity .
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns , for she comes after his appointment as a member of the shadows and after his speech at TU@@ C &apos;s Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the decision of the Labour leaders , on Tuesday , during the National An@@ them of the National An@@ them , has prov@@ oked a commem@@ oration to the 7@@ 5th anniversary of Battle of Britain in silence and is at the center of several title @-@ Pages in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision , not the National An@@ them to sing , has attracted attention
he said Mr Cor@@ by@@ n he said &quot; in the respectful silence &quot; and he recognized the &quot; hero@@ ism of Royal Air Force in the Battle of England . &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Schatten@@ kab@@ in@@ ett , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC @-@ president to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independently &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shade @-@ spirits have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns for the top team , and they are called on differences in business , defense and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliament@@ arians party originally supported him as leaders . &quot;
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences can also be st@@ acked within the Labour Office and according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of winn@@ ings .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference to put Labour changes in order to remove the whole idea of a overall limitation .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow of work and pensions , that the party is &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it is only up to the government plans to reduce the limit of 26@@ ,000 pounds over 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour chair , David Cameron , since he has been T@@ ory Chef , over the last decade of the Disp@@ atch @-@ Box across the parliament . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader who promised another political sentence , says that he did &quot; &quot; Cro@@ w@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30.000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ lington North MP said that the Prime Minister of the Prime Minister expressed his confidence and that he is refra@@ ining from &quot; bri@@ ck@@ iness &quot; and fighting with reluc@@ tance to concentrate on serious issues such as poverty , inequality and the challenges facing young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow of economics is represented in him if he is not participating - for instance , if Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word and that he John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , addressed to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cameron , when he was a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said that he is often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s style in the style of a &quot; &quot; Kas@@ per@@ le Theatre &quot; . &quot; but a few years later he showed that he has failed . &quot;
&quot; when she was first sent to television first in 1990 , the fra@@ gment of the Prime Minister was seen as the most important bar@@ ometer of a leader and his position in the House of Commons , and his position under his parliament@@ arians , although critics did argue that she has become a caricature and more advanced reforms . &quot;

pounds increases by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound went spr@@ ink@@ ly to data that indicate a rise in wage growth of the UK . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the Geb@@ ot@@ s@@ ziel SA@@ BM@@ iller today . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.8 % compared to the same period of the same period last year . &quot;
&quot; this percentage was the fastest and cost estimates since 2009 , and estimates about the time of an interest rate . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was charged up to 0.@@ 84 % compared to the euro on 1,@@ 7@@ 30 € . &quot;
the FT@@ SE 100 Index completed with an increase of 1.9 % to 6.@@ 22@@ 9.@@ 21 .
&quot; SA@@ BM@@ iller was the outstanding share in the market and made a jump of 20 % , after taking over the ri@@ vals of the Riv@@ al AB In@@ Be@@ v . &quot;
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies of the world and brands such as bud@@ ge@@ on , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
&quot; Bur@@ berry @-@ shares were for encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , both by luxury goods and chem@@ ist 0,@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
&quot; ri@@ chem@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat out all expectations , and show that sales in China - a key market for bur@@ dens - again growth . &quot;
&quot; the shares of Glen@@ core climbed by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion USD through a share of sales as part of its strategy of debt management . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper group MON@@ DI were the largest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease by 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had earned his estimate for the company R@@ ating on . &quot;
J@@ D Sports increased by 3.@@ 1 % after the athle@@ tic company had reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the six months .
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages will end@@ anger the expansion .
the CEO of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers &quot; could mean more buying power in the pockets of potential customers .
&quot; but it is unlikely that this department buying the higher working costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could become expan@@ sion@@ ing plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less extra jobs . &quot;

also ben@@ ding itself does not .
he is already cat@@ ered .
&quot; for the claim in the advertising break of the Super@@ k@@ assi@@ er he received three million , a bi@@ ennial deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ple company put many , a lot of dollars into the ben@@ ding account . &quot;
&quot; and with every d@@ oll , which looks like he and over the shop , the ben@@ ding is also involved . &quot;
when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber has a coffee drinks that is un@@ iting on the pane .
more than 100 million of them have been so exploited .
some say the hyp@@ e g@@ inge too far .
&quot; others emphasize , ben@@ ding is finally in the USA and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you speak ? &quot; &quot; on position 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , we are not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A pla@@ que brings the Lebanese to the potato be@@ trot@@ ter
potatoes or tin ?
&quot; it is both - and even in the potato be@@ trot@@ ter , that of the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack @-@ owner Han@@ i Al@@ ha@@ y has developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the Sp@@ ru@@ ch &quot; Kar@@ to@@ le instead of &quot; &quot; diamond &quot; &quot; on a poster of the P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A movement , Al@@ ha@@ y potato and meat taken together to a sp@@ it . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a P@@ EG@@ ID@@ A demonstration with the &quot; &quot; potatoes instead of &quot; &quot; spi@@ der &quot; &quot; that he accidentally seen on TV . &quot;
&quot; since then , in its store , a gri@@ pping e@@ wer that is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ ticultural for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ ha@@ y . &quot;
the idea has registered in the field of the Lebanese office in Munich in the meantime .
there it has been protected as general information according to the authority of the agency .
&quot; like lots of meat and like a lot of potatoes in the sp@@ it , Al@@ ha@@ y doesn &apos;t want to reveal . &quot;
&quot; only as much : &quot; it tastes altogether even better , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
even at his customers the culinary League understanding is good .
met@@ adata starts to fight against Al@@ di@@ - in@@ ges@@ tion
met@@ ry tries to protect the Ig@@ A @-@ branch in front of an Al@@ di @-@ march in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale distributor Met@@ cash has launched a pre @-@ operating campaign to defend the market share of the Ig@@ A retailer in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di preparing the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia in the beginning of next year , Met@@ adata and Ig@@ A @-@ Super@@ market will strengthen its relationships with local food suppliers , and build the MA@@ A brand by mainstream marketing and marketing over social media outlets , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A @-@ merchants and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ borough , who in Ig@@ A stores are distributed and shop @-@ owner who sell tickets to the South Australian football club to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to cash out more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when wholesale distributor for food , alcohol and equipment leads to their annual investors . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , since South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ a @-@ Ig@@ A @-@ charging stations , and higher profits as Met@@ cas@@ hs Ig@@ A @-@ network in the East states . &quot;
&quot; securities in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ orious in South Australia and Western Australia , possess a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Queensland - more than 30 percent in Western Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia in comparison to some 14 percent in the East states . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts as Morgan Stan@@ ley , that Al@@ di twelve months after opening his first markets will cut around five percent of the food market in these two states and sell all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published in this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath from Morgan Stan@@ ley said that Ig@@ A retailer 360 $ million euros per year and Met@@ cash 250 million can be lost by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this prognosis was based on assuming that Al@@ di has launched 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA , and generates sales of $ 500 and 600 million in every market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food store and at the quantities on Met@@ cas@@ hs high Fi@@ x@@ mas base could cost Met@@ cash some 13 million dollar earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash market shares in the east states , mainly to Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan came out that Ig@@ A @-@ purchaser is the most faithful . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley is assuming that Met@@ cas@@ hs sales grow in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2017 and 2 percent in 2017 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , the founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , in a business dinner in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . &quot;
cash withdraw@@ als refused to respond to the comments from Mr Dou@@ glass .
&quot; however , it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash with Mr Dou@@ glass last week has been made in contact with Mr Dou@@ glass . &quot;
&quot; IG@@ As market share has declined since 2010 of 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ cas@@ hs food and food trade , which is about 1,@@ 200 thousand A retailer , has been around 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting its operative debt recovery at simultaneous high pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ al@@ ers we@@ es themselves and inv@@ ests more than 150 million dollars to improve sales prices by Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths , for hundreds of products each week and to deliver Ig@@ A @-@ retailers to improving their stores by fast growing fresh foods and deliver better selection of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ a &apos;s major business leaders Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustment and loading programs to El@@ an are recognized and hopes that the wholesale distributor in 2017 will return for the first time in four years back to a winner growth .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ son is supported by President of the Australian tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ akis deserves more praise as criticism for his behavior .
Than@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ son was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and deserves to view the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly more praise as criticism for his own behavior .
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ son , the younger of the talented Du@@ os that is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s &quot; , got into the spotlight by the in@@ famous argument of K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os and St@@ an W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery Quali@@ fication game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon afterwards , Kok@@ kin@@ son and his opponent Ry@@ an Harrison had to be separated from the arbit@@ ers twice before Harrison : &quot; W@@ AW@@ R@@ IN@@ KA would have to beat K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os , and I should propose the child . &quot;
&quot; as he was recently seen , how he hit a tennis r@@ ack@@ et , after a cr@@ amp@@ f struck a potential US @-@ open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ akis was terri@@ bly defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently at Glasgow , in the competition with Sam Gr@@ oth at the second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ finals against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing over which I should be quite ti@@ ghtened , the fact that after my view T@@ asi has drawn a little in the dispute , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has been crus@@ hed a bat when he lost because of a bow in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken one r@@ ack@@ et out of frustration with himself , and I know Than@@ x good enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved in the US Open extremely well , even among the fairly pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Harrison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too high . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is trained in shape , he is good in form , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged by his own merits . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to take into consideration K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os in the important decision making it begins on Friday and he describes the &quot; &quot; joint decision &quot; &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term integral part of the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we wish that the team is fully focused on the competition and not all the controllers . &#91; K@@ yr@@ gi@@ os &#93; , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; and I believe that Nick was made very quick to Ascension , what people like Feder@@ er and Mur@@ ray pointed out . he goes in the eyes of the public , and he made some di@@ re mistakes , but we try to make him think of him , and it &apos;s best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
Europe Refu@@ ge@@ e crisis : Hungary explains not@@ aries that closes the border to refugees
&quot; Hungary explains the state of the state and ri@@ dd@@ led the border with Serbia on Tuesday and stopped all who tried to get illegal in the country , all trying to stop the influ@@ x of migrants . &quot;
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ul@@ fed to a kidney and Serbian government re@@ acted with rebellion . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were set aside for an un@@ familiar time in a country @-@ strip at the road between the two check@@ points of the countries and built tents , and settled down there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations rose up .
&quot; when a police helicopter over them moved , &quot; &quot; the migrants &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; and sm@@ elling insul@@ ts against the Hungarian security policy . &quot;
some were rejected for protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s Foreign Minister declared it &quot; &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants would go back from Hungary during more and more from Macedonia and Greece . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral .
&quot; in the coming days discussions with Brussels and other countries will take place , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence to the Hungarian border @-@ Ser@@ b border came a day after the 28 @-@ nations block during a deb@@ atable meeting in Brussels could not agree a common immigration policy .
&quot; however , the Ministers agreed to divide the responsibility for some 40,000 people who would seek refuge in the over @-@ p@@ umped Italy and Greece . they aff@@ licted their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be agreed that the EU states would take another 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some of Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria demanded a special summit in the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a permanent action between Brussels or his neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency fair held on Tuesday in two southern regions gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis , so that they could shut down roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
the Hungarian foreign minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ j@@ ar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania to stop the in@@ flow of migrants through the country - after it ended a fence at the present border .
&quot; C@@ BS News @-@ correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison @-@ rises in the race , which was used to create a bar@@ bed fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ pass and an entry point to the European Union elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , President Viktor Or@@ ban had ins@@ isted that most of the coming economic migrants are seeking better lives and are non @-@ minded people who are entitled to protection - a view that is strong in contradiction with other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws created by midnight in Hungary , crossing the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high Za@@ us to build the government along the southern border with Serbia , for a crime . these laws also place higher pen@@ alties for the off@@ ender conven@@ e . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation , which was created by the mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eged . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must not even agree to the use of the military that will be expected for next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already taken place on the border with vehicles and dogs already for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , land @-@ security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others were already penetr@@ ated into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come across , def@@ endant the fence , they are now in police forces and are accused of being accused of criminal off@@ ences , according to their new laws . &quot;
authorities are quick to fix the fence .
&quot; Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border crossing with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train wag@@ gon with bar@@ bed wire , to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos ren@@ ches the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to deal with the data of people and press a crowd to move there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in entering , but thousands stayed out . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main highway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election @-@ 2016 : Hill@@ ary Clinton &apos;s lead in front of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders into national survey
&quot; the former US Secretary of State Hill@@ ary Clinton continues to hold a two @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at the national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ ander wins in front of it . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has the support of 47 percent of democratic voters in the presidential elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ ander was second in second position , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet proclaimed whether he en@@ code for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of democratic voters of the presidential elections . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the presidential elections , most democratic voters say that it is too early to say that their opinion is what candidates will support they . &quot;
but Clin@@ ic supporters are more enduring than those of the other candidates in their election .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News survey , Clinton has lost in a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders had some profits . &quot;
&quot; Clinton holds a huge advantage with women and a temper@@ ate , but these le@@ aps have dimin@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has significantly dropped , and S@@ anders will be back here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ics &apos;s benefit at democratic voters under the age of 50 has already fle@@ dged themselves , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same height . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a huge advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with two @-@ digit cutting edge at the liber@@ als , but above now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
&quot; about half of the democratic voters of the presidential elections say that they had been supporting Clinton , if they were nominated by the Party . &quot;
&quot; a quarter would support them with some pre@@ orders and another 15 percent would only support they , because they are the nom@@ inee . &quot;
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clin@@ t &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusias@@ tically .
&quot; while 48 percent of democratic voters of the presidential elections say they were Clinton with enthusiasm , say less Republi@@ can voters do so through their top candidates Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 % ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clin@@ ique supporters in an open question are asked , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it &apos;s time is that a woman president is president ( 13 percent ) and that they are the best candidate for the job ( 10 % ) . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ ics Sup@@ porters , their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to dealing with problems and the voters are also quoted .
&quot; since the Vice President raises the potential for the presidential office in the Or@@ ag@@ shell , 57 percent of democratic voters of the presidential elections will see him in the race - even though a third does not think he should do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters are asked of the presidential elections , who would be a second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den on the top . &quot;
&quot; by Clin@@ ics followers more than half of them say , their second choice would be far from anything . &quot;
&quot; decided by bi@@ den , not for the nom@@ ination of the Democrats , Hill@@ ary Clinton has increased their lead in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ den in race on 30 points without placing him in the race . &quot;
&quot; five @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best odds to win elections , but this figure has fallen from 78 per cent in the last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; dial &quot; has increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , the Democratic voters have questions about the constitu@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; similarly as last month , no single democr@@ at candidate or potential candidate for these voters of the presidential elections were not acceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidate or potential candidates achieve good results with several important reg@@ isters over the presidential elections of their party .
&quot; we consider Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den as honest and trustworthy and with strong man@@ ag@@ or@@ us . &quot;
&quot; bi@@ den cuts the top three candidates best from honesty , while Clin@@ ics &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trustworthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
democratic voters of the pro @-@ elections generally also look at Clinton , S@@ anders and bi@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; with all of these measurements , approximately a quarter of the democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions to Hill@@ ary Clin@@ ique &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term as an out@@ State Department , most of the Democratic voters of the presidential elections are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say it has not influenced their opinions . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public .
&quot; half of the Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about one third is content . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was in March , shortly after the problem was coming to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on their overall opinion of Clinton , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Re@@ public@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views of Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is seen by the voters of their party as honest and trustworthy it is still a problem for them of registered constitu@@ ents in general : only 32 percent see them as honest and trustworthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of the eligible voters do not hold them for an honest and trusted person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters will see also more dump than not honest and not trustworthy . &quot;
Clinton and Tr@@ ump receive good notes on tour .
&quot; of the six un@@ tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush respond best with honesty . &quot;
&quot; a majority can look like honestly , but as with car@@ son many do not have any opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the presidential elections is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves close to Donald Tr@@ ump for a national survey
Ben Car@@ son is at the latest survey of C@@ BS News / New York Times @-@ tight behind Donald Tr@@ ump
&quot; the two candidates meanwhile coinci@@ des half of the support of voters in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support tr@@ ump in large numbers . support is growing by 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey , which was conducted prior to Fox News debate last month to 27 % in survey on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son flo@@ wed in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
&quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son in demographic groups best reaches and tr@@ ump among Republi@@ can voters with higher education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ early Fior@@ ina and Ohio &apos;s governor John Ka@@ yourself , is struck with Wis@@ cons@@ &apos;s governor Scott Walker , who dropped at least 10 % of the last month at present 2 % . &quot;
former Florida @-@ Gover@@ nor L@@ b Bush the former governor of Arkan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are located with 6 % on the third place .
the bu@@ ck@@ ranges at the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or minus 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / Or@@ c survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son desc@@ ends in the surveys - he lands with 19 % support among public@@ ans , behind the dump with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest survey of ABC news / Washington Post revealed also Tr@@ ump clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view to one of the last week rising Car@@ son , Tr@@ ump found some aspect drives for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son used to put its m@@ umps on question . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump in Iowa during a campaign show in Iowa . &quot;

five members of the Brotherhood with the death of a Bar@@ uch College
&quot; nearly two years , after a student during a female @-@ called ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , died , murder will be filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New Yor@@ ker House P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ SI @-@ Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un , Michael &quot; Den@@ g during a introductory session in September 2013 and delayed his transport to the hospital , which has contributed to his death , shared the police with us . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with his eyes with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack full of sand , and reiter@@ ated , while he tried to go over a frozen field at a destination . &quot;
Mr. Den@@ g then compl@@ ained about headaches but then he fell unconscious .
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta P@@ SI rat@@ ernity did not render the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g impot@@ ent , and waited an hour before they brought him to a hospital so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , his symptoms to goo@@ gle and Andy Men@@ g , to contact the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said pol@@ ye@@ ef Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point the members , utensils began to hide and put the welfare of the Brotherhood principle beyond that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said Poli@@ ra@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
he could not revi@@ ved himself and he died in the next morning at his wounds .
&quot; after a Aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g is repeated with bl@@ unter @-@ strength injury to head , torso and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the troubles of the Brotherhood . at least one student has been participating in the ranks since 1970 every year , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer of the D@@ eng@@ s family , in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members have to be held to account , and this step by public authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the first five members .
&quot; two @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with fatal attacks and forming a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to accept the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or un@@ official - this is sanc@@ tioned , then we will also hold them to account , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the national frat@@ ernity re@@ vo@@ ke its affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases the interest rates
&quot; a CO@@ MB@@ O raise , and the house@@ work will be installed , ren@@ ces for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into a recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history for the economy will only provide a small guide to the procedure . &quot;
a recession came in only 11 months after the first interest rate and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggression of the Federal Reserve in raising interest rates is often , albeit not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments are responding . &quot;
&quot; the representatives of the US central bank have stressed as heavily that investors should not concentrate on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather to the period that is needed for norm@@ alization . &quot;
in fact several variables play a role .
&quot; in the end , market participants could determine that the full excitement was exagger@@ ated because of a raise . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in F@@ ed since the global financial crisis is inevitably to be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , leader of Capital Economics , in a communication to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of the US interest rates to normal heights , but still at low level , to lead to se@@ is@@ mic shock , which seem to fear many . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a historical trend based on how some areas of the economy might respond :
&quot; as the market has seen in the last month , the removal of inser@@ tions can volati@@ le things for a while volati@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once the increase occurs , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that finances will be dimin@@ ished by 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps again reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study about what happens after inser@@ tions of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market has been published usually in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the path to inser@@ tion raise , fairly flat within the past six years , with an average yield in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , which has published Bob D@@ oll , Chief facility strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , in Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares will tend to occur later in the level @-@ cycle and returns the return to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but Z@@ inser@@ tions often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is faced with some conditions which could not before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
&quot; highly not@@ e@@ worthy is that the gross Dom@@ estic Product is located in the vicinity of its lowest point , at a over@@ raise of the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , 118 rate increases since 1950 only twice the nominal GDP under 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 lay at 3,@@ 6 percent in 2015 , only few people expect this to last and expect the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed only 1.5 per cent . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ tions in such a fragile economic setting could be risky and raise the question &quot; &quot; if it &apos;s different this time , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have taken the whole year to a single raise of the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strateg@@ ists and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could get an increase in this session , the fut@@ ures trading is only a 25 percent probability . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all initial @-@ cycles of 1950 to date have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and at the end of rec@@ rec@@ sion@@ ists very quickly placed after the beginning of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what the worst recession in the observed phase was . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest , the F@@ ed has been awaiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this was so far 74 months . &quot;
&quot; a fixed income was also volati@@ le because the market absor@@ bs a shar@@ pen@@ ance , and the pattern is pretty much the same as in the capital market . &quot;
&quot; the main difference is that the effect in bonds is much faster than with shares , if they change their strategic course . &quot;
&quot; in bonds , the ren@@ ces seem to change the direction once the first increase in the cycle shall take place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the outcome @-@ cycle , the bond forms will immediately fall , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; the strateg@@ ists of Charles Schw@@ ab believe that the increase in interest rates is leading , that ren@@ ces are squee@@ zed between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ uation of the curve . &quot;
&quot; high @-@ quality bonds often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed In@@ come Analy@@ stin from Schw@@ ab , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interesting , Jones says that the markets have already been adapted to expectations from F@@ ed Strategy . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some evidence that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot;
&quot; interest rates have risen , the yield is fl@@ atter , borro@@ wers have increased and the volati@@ lity has increased -- all the characteristics of the market , if the F@@ ed intensified its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and whole companies , companies that benefit the greater part of their business operations in the United States will benefit , if interest rates are increasing and local products are more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debts are worse off because an increasing dollar price makes its products more expensive on the global market as well as financing their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be able to react very positively three months after an initial entry increase , &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with watch@@ ful balance after each of the inser@@ tions in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 on average by 5 percent@@ ages . &quot;
companies with high capital expenditure and low volati@@ lity in their stocks also met their counterparts with low quality at an average of 4 ( percent@@ ages ) and 3 ( percent@@ ages ) .
debt will become a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest are lost most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the stock market , consumers are also benef@@ iting because of the increasing amount of dollars . &quot;
&quot; savings could see profits through higher earnings , even when experts from different opinions are , how fast they are taking place . &quot;
BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM says Parliament member Andrew B@@ ingham
the conservative member of Parliament critici@@ zed the sender because of its &quot; du@@ st@@ proof &quot; ( certificate ) .
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly unable to distinguish from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards and said they im@@ it@@ ated The Br@@ its
Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins reached the show The Voice and said this was not very original .
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; conver@@ ts &quot; to Classic FM , claiming a leading parliament@@ arians and increases new pressure on the sender , to prove that he does something what the private sen@@ ders do not do . &quot;
&quot; conservative MEP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ Bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radi@@ os@@ ens@@ er &quot; sli@@ ms &quot; and increasingly no longer be distingu@@ is@@ hable from his commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t use the word &quot; &quot; silly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to transform itself Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started in December last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , The Br@@ its seem to be just under another name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something different - these are two spontaneous examples , in which you actually only mim@@ ic what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General passed the accus@@ ations back and argued that BBC Radio 3 went long before his commercial competitors when it comes to music music and to the public .
&quot; what I learn from Radio 3 , that will I learn anywhere else about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music @-@ making that really un@@ matched .
&quot; and the dedication of Radio 3 , to find new music and to give new works on behalf , I also really consider important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey that they had to be harder to engage the audience as it did so in the past because the British are less informed of classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 was , however , not the only element of BBC production which during the hearing in the committee for the selection of culture , media and sport advoc@@ ated by fire , the commercial ri@@ vals on the feet . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ory @-@ MPs Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins , to The Voice at the BBC &apos;s musical talent show at the BBC , which was purchased from Dutch producers Tal@@ pa Media for estimated cost of € 22 million . &quot;
&quot; do you see why this program is often discussed , because it is not original and not particularly distinctive ? &quot;
Lord Hall ins@@ isted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC manner .
&quot; he added that he would like to find the company &quot; &quot; a hit from our in @-@ house barn , &quot; &quot; if it starts the next time a entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to exclude the order from other rows of The Voice in the future or to make money belonging to other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet connection rose in August on the slo@@ west and the Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there have been seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
last month there was the lowest result since the start of the record in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using cell@@ phones to shop
experts believe that the Black Friday did not hit the issues in November .
&quot; for over a decade , the virtual shopping has dri@@ lled a curved , and many of the main shopping streets of Britain have turned into battle cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are now signs that pro@@ stag@@ nat@@ ing online numbers after new numbers shown only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the total expenditure on August showed the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 , with only five percent increase compared with the previous year . &quot;
experts say that there are signs that online sales will be st@@ agn@@ ant after new numbers showed only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , the course of time has always developed , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ RG sales outside . &quot;
&quot; he explained that the on @-@ line sales increased three years ago , as a buyer began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people were able to shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ utes itself , and we may possibly experience that growth decreases . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon which was imported from America is cited as a reason for the subsequent revenues .
&quot; experts believe that buyers have their purchases in front of this event , taking place each last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers for their computers to make their bar@@ gain , and some merchants @-@ sites cras@@ hed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyer could kill because of bar@@ gain , buyers from what &apos;s going to stop . &quot;
&quot; a study conducted by the British Ret@@ ail Consor@@ tium , found out a total of 5 £ after spending more than 1 £ online . &quot;
&quot; with some products like television and washing machines , more than one third of purchases now is carried out through Web @-@ shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion pa@@ wns in the inner cities . &quot;

Mr Ak@@ ram was on the big mosque with his parents before the start of the annual p@@ addle .

&quot; in the beginning of this week Sal@@ man tended to un@@ veil what the overthrow of the Cran@@ e was caused , which caught in a courtyard of the grand mo@@ de@@ ee , where hundreds of thousands of Moslems from H@@ add@@ sch , later gathered in this month . &quot;

&quot; she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households , the more renov@@ ations than in the past . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; it still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
we have to move this more strongly towards a balance .
&quot; in principle , half of our customers come from women with 80 percent of all decisions regarding the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who managed one of only five women at the top of a British in FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also invited her top team to reflect equal number of men and women in executive positions . &quot;
&quot; king@@ fis@@ her is almost the only company that has occupied 50 percent of the team with women , including his management and financial status . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - variety is here an important topic .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
king@@ fis@@ her re@@ mel@@ ted a decline in half @-@ year income and revenues after the group included the cost of closing the store .

function@@ aries of A@@ I / DO@@ B because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; at the State Court of Kla@@ gen@@ furt on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ president A@@ I / DO@@ B have to be responsible for de@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and abor@@ tion . &quot;
the accused are not guilty .
one of them had been charged for abuse of abuse .
he was acqu@@ itted of this accus@@ ation in May of law .
the current process has been ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the pro@@ secutor &apos;s pro@@ secutor , Robert Ri@@ ffel had turned out in the pre @-@ examination , that the Acc@@ used in the years 2006 to 2011 were used to disp@@ ose of corporate accounts , used for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he will be responsible for the damage , with about 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the Sports @-@ Func@@ tion@@ aries are also charged for funding .
&quot; this fact , the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , Ri@@ ghter in Micha@@ ela San@@ in , aus . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; the pro@@ clamation of the in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity presented the defense , that the association was created at no time a property . &quot;
&quot; the sports@@ men had only calculated losses and the sports@@ club , for whom they had worked from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they have invested a lot of time and money to get out of debt - the pas@@ va amoun@@ ted to about 600@@ ,000 sh@@ illing ( approx . 4@@ 4,000 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; back then , we were standing in front of the situation : let us continue or block the club , &quot; &quot; told one of the def@@ endants , in the Br@@ ot@@ ur@@ f of the financial market . &quot;
he then decided to take this task with his colleagues and fellow @-@ def@@ endants .
with all the risks .
&quot; we have been prescribed for money to get our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said in the acceptance . &quot;
&quot; the association was agreed : you can manage the money freely , there are only no debts . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , on the relative financial success the payout of the allowance is retro@@ active until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the allowance for years later years later , namely in 2003 , when a plus had been in the account , paid off . &quot;
&quot; hence , l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detailed finishes , the ex @-@ man explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and divisions managed the two def@@ endants , said the second accused . &quot;
why the payments were not disclosed to the association in detail was the judge asked .
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of financial provi@@ dence , therefore only the freedom of debt has been , thus the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in the year of 2011 called for the official investigation of Ministers of Ministers , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were back , declared the accused . &quot;
&quot; this securities ran on the name of the second accused , and was not known to the association according to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? , &quot; wanted to know the ri@@ ghter . &quot;
&quot; in that case , the Be@@ asked for a long time didn &apos;t know an answer . &quot;
&quot; then he said , he believed that this is the best thing for the club . &quot;
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have been receiving something from this money , the pro@@ secutor placed it into the room . &quot;
the other @-@ accused would have been informed are the function@@ ary .
this transfer was formulated as &quot; claim par@@ amount . &quot;
why damage compensation ? we wanted to know ri@@ chter@@ in and pro@@ secutor .
&quot; the first def@@ endant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association had never taken any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do , when the lawyer says , &quot; With this you are all out of the hook . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal coun@@ sel ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said , he never obtained a cent salary , comp@@ uted him just o@@ dom@@ eter and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; if he had been charged the association 1,000 euros per month , the actual expense was much higher than he added . &quot;
&quot; however , accurate documents for the early years could not present the accused . &quot;
&quot; these are based in an examination , in which everything was judged as correctly , no longer preserved , declared them . &quot;
o@@ dom@@ eter was also related to the second accused .
&quot; all ins@@ isting must be made in cash ; for this , he has to drive from his home office as a bank to a lead , he stated in his statement . &quot;
the main proceedings of the trial will be continued on September 23 by the question@@ ing of witnesses .

&quot; in this way , the cost of € 2.7 billion ( 2.2 billion euros ) should be saved , distributed the company on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of about 2.7 billion dollars , which will drop off after the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 5@@ 5,000 jobs has not yet been completed for the past three years . &quot;

time of decision on interest rates for the US staff
&quot; the world is observed when the US head@@ bank publishes two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists , who were interviewed by Re@@ uters , found that a little more than half , which last week of view was , now thinks that F@@ ed is going to do something longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0,@@ 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; it is a historical event , because it is seven years ago since the F@@ ed interest on N@@ UL@@ L sat down . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may end the zero area and start a process of norm@@ alisation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bi@@ des , leading staff at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good performance level , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less crude outlook on global conditions . &quot;
&quot; you have warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the odds against such a step are good . &quot;
the decision should be announced at 20@@ .00 a.m. on Thursday
cause of death to the Delta State University allowed to write ap@@ ologies .
&quot; after the shooting and killing of his girlfriend in Mississippi on Monday morning - and before he later killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ annon wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; I &quot; &quot; with the first murder and wanted , &quot; &quot; he could let it happen &quot; , &quot; gave authorities on Tuesday . &quot;

and said he killed someone and killed someone .
represented by the staff of the emergency central that the police officers had to send police to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I took my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; sweet dog &quot; was in the house , who will &quot; &quot; bother &quot; &quot; but will probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the recru@@ ited after his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
he was not an explanation for his kis@@ ses .
&quot; when police declared the scene , they found the body of Amy Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written notice of Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; I am sorry I could do it . &quot;

&quot; after writing the mem@@ orandum from 300 miles to Delta State University , where he took E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , k@@ ills , before completing his own life on Monday night when poli@@ c@@ emen were killed . &quot;
&quot; he said William La@@ For@@ ge , he did not know about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb claimed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss always had a relationship with Schmidt said the public authorities on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information &quot; no evidence &quot; of a &quot; three @-@ day relationship . &quot;
&quot; ss came about by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said she had been married for about seven years , when a &quot; good man &quot; was described . &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed with friends . &quot;

&quot; K@@ now@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , had met for about three years with he . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said K@@ now@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that relatives tried to say to them at any given point on Monday to say to them , &quot; &quot; he will not go into prison . &quot;
&quot; when poli@@ cem@@ an him arriving at Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later in that night , he drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the woods and sle@@ w himself with a shot . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United is able to not play Mon@@ sters because of dou@@ bling frac@@ ture
&quot; Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double comb@@ ing of his right B@@ one for the Champions League of Manchester , at the Champions League defeat of Manchester in the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this has yiel@@ ded the right def@@ ender to the wines and close it for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al will not hope that Sha@@ w is again playing in this season . &quot;
&quot; this injury was caused by a reck@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15 minute , after the 20 year old Sha@@ w has collap@@ sed in the PS@@ V sector . &quot;
he was treated for nine minutes on the pitch and needed oxygen before being transferred to the hospital .
van Ga@@ al said : &quot; he has a re@@ vocation and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and will be involved in Manchester .
&quot; it is terrible - a boy who comes to Manchester United at the age of 18 , and then it &apos;s very hard and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had a oxygen mas@@ on .
he wept .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to escape a Red Card and the hanging of a El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nicola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbit@@ er , has not sanc@@ tioned the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al pres@@ ump@@ ted that the Italian refer@@ ee was mistaken .
&quot; you can judge for yourself when I say , that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due . &quot;
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a twe@@ et upon Sha@@ ws : &quot; I thank you all for your messages . words can not describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back stronger again . &quot;
&quot; here@@ to : Manchester United is suffering the loss of Luke Sha@@ w , in the defeat at the PS@@ V . &quot;
&quot; with the European championship in France , the UK def@@ ender has an additional incentive to recover in the coming June . &quot;
&quot; Philli@@ p Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
if a player leaves the place with this kind of injury are all very sad about it .
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an enemy .
&quot; Mor@@ eno suffered a leg , when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ as Holland team at the 2014 World Cup . &quot;
&quot; he is doing very hard because it was not his intention to hurt the opponent , and if you then hear it is a very bad injury , this is not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was moving in a different direction , so it looked like him &#91; Mor@@ eno &#93; had touched him but I could not see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 , Mor@@ eno : &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad there . I am sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Guar@@ dad@@ o was also transferred to the hospital - according to a F@@ oul@@ der by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it will not be long before you know it almost completely . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a supplier of child care systems , his favorite children &apos;s book was asked to name his favorite children &apos;s book , the Prime Minister of The Lor@@ ax , decided by Dr. Se@@ uss in 1971 . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes David in a message on the website of Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative , and with a powerful message , it is a book that I like to read my children because it seems always an image or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; everything nice and well , except that the subsequent paragraph , in which Cameron is said to describe the story of the book , instead a summ@@ ari@@ zing of the film version of 2012 returns , added the new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature is gone and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to see a boy named Ted , the girl of Au@@ dre@@ y , his real name The@@ odor Se@@ uss Ho@@ el lau@@ ghed and the 1991 died , but completely unknown . &quot;
&quot; as if this is not suspi@@ cious enough , the text presented by Cameron reads in part like the summary of the Lor@@ ax film which is presented on the website of Internet Movie databases and thus begins : &quot; in the w@@ alled city Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , he hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y to the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he gives to be a prag@@ matic Father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is familiar with the action of book so little . here goes an un@@ ren@@ amed young , like the local environment because of the cas@@ u@@ che@@ ating Lor@@ ax , a ho@@ ckey , sle@@ ep@@ y being , &quot; which is referred to in the name of the trees &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax for 20 times in a child . &quot;
a Down@@ ing @-@ street spokes@@ person said that the text was probably taken by Mr Cameron &apos;s electoral office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text was delivered by Mr Cameron &apos;s staff , but there was no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened from the exclusion of England but it is still hard .
&quot; if you encounter Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but when you chose the cad@@ res selected to England for the tour , there is a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series of defeat on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ ward .
&quot; A@@ poll@@ air C@@ looks side is possibly less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin@@ players in the Batt@@ ing list , and the collective spirit is strong ; they will not carry a scar@@ ring of 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball game Mo@@ een Ali as spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an un@@ familiar size on the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
&quot; in this case , Adam Ly@@ th is borro@@ wed from the England test cad@@ res and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales . &quot;
&quot; the decision to allow Adam Ly@@ th is to be difficult for me as his chief trainer in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that Kri@@ cket@@ player faces results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question symbols of Joe R@@ oot , for example , and this led to the nom@@ ination since - and I said this - players are their very best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one had el@@ ong@@ ated the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control over his own destiny . &quot;
&quot; hopefully , if he will hopefully come out more runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance will come out . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Bay@@ l@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that surprised me not ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test @-@ stroke will get to put his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton nine was given . &quot;
&quot; only Comp@@ ton had the chance to do home and forward @-@ looking . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can collect was that England was first shown Jonathan in the Caribbean , as ly@@ th was in the highest form - but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales will come in , and he is a drummer , which I highly value . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor Cri@@ cket@@ player , which we saw in Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us at a Tr@@ ent Bridge square which was very affected . &quot;
&quot; he must receive at least the same opportunities as before him , but of course this depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea of releasing Mo@@ lakes in addition to Cook , which would yield an extra @-@ spin @-@ Bow@@ ler and four Qui@@ et sw@@ ings , di@@ pped up , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a stroke can &apos;t hit there , and this link @-@ handed has already shown that he is a hot @-@ shot of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een might not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is no number 3 for them , and there is no difference . &quot;
&quot; my previous team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger has played its first 38 tests on the first drop , before he joined as Open@@ er in 2001 . &quot;
he did manage three hundred runs immediately and did not look back .
&quot; Z@@ af@@ ar Ans@@ ari comes to the Ka@@ der as back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him , he was very impressed as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see their statistics on average - average 31 with the r@@ ack@@ et and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s an pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup co@@ ag@@ ons who rise their hands and have chosen the coach . &quot;
on this tour he will learn a lot .
&quot; apart from the crew , England has made some smart supplements for the coach . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela D@@ awar@@ er , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nicest guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience because it has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Col@@ ling@@ wood is coming for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and powerful use to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he is created for the international Cri@@ cket competition , as players or as coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , new voices can bring fresh air in the locker room , even if the messages are in accordance with the beforehand . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ l@@ ys team @-@ mate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used with the One @-@ Day@@ ers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it . &quot;
&quot; some will not agree , but Co@@ aches and Team@@ leaders do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with players depend on their jobs on the results .
such decisions are not being made easy .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a European diplom@@ at said &quot; &quot; said , that some member states , so deeply ent@@ an@@ gled into different crises , such as the EU is now and not always of their own debt , Great Britain itself , created agenda with se@@ greg@@ ated concessions and disturbing contracting changes they are not fed up . &quot;
&quot; in Brighton , TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it when they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze their social protection . &quot;
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ fie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister emphas@@ ise at summit or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves before a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they are allies for reforms . &quot;
it is always about me .
&quot; my European friend who wishes to look outside the UK inside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and can look through that more and more short @-@ sighted ministers and officials come to the point where they don &apos;t care , whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; war@@ ped chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is a allies , but she has been in power for ten years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for them , as it has happened over the exagger@@ ated bur@@ gl@@ ars like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and Kohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French President François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its creation in 2017 .
he is also a da@@ unting strength .
Poland probably has a nationalist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will be able to root out a leg to prevent the Sel@@ fie British , their energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something that they don &apos;t want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even plan not helpful comments , completely at the SN@@ P @-@ style , during Great Britain &apos;s speech campaign in order to accelerate the Bre@@ xit process , susp@@ ects my friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a Ple@@ ite , and &quot; Great Britain won &apos;t win anything from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost and what EU scep@@ tics called the oligarchy of the Press endu@@ ms in 1975 , but not by Tony Ben@@ n inspired referendum , but not that she supported our entrance to 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak to Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro opportun@@ ists , who has made a name for himself as a &quot; EU sc@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; in Brussels @-@ correspon@@ dent in the early 90 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; with all his de@@ pra@@ vity , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; to this part , the med@@ ley of tax @-@ feared be@@ hoo@@ ks , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ et foreigners and the pseudo @-@ In@@ ger@@ tes include most of our major newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually , Tony Blair is similar about them , but found that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better spread ban@@ anas to di@@ stract him instead of having lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ sto@@ y@@ ans than Blair themselves , when he was opposed to the rule of the EU , then he was rejected by the Constitution , then opened by French and Dutch voters in 2005 to open it an back door . &quot;
the press has never denied him .
&quot; but the cute Jer@@ emy Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a kind for me on Monday in Westminster yesterday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to do more for me - seems to repeat the danger of N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ cks boy@@ cott , the 80 @-@ er years , an error of that time and today . &quot;
&quot; it may last but he must develop a coher@@ ent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC s he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe - I express it very friendly - in development .
he says that we should remain in a re@@ formed EU .
now most people outside of U@@ ki@@ ps traditional Bl@@ auf@@ arity tendency and the wil@@ der che@@ fil@@ ings of fol@@ ys Klein @-@ British can everyone say yes to everyone .
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; A Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Ben@@ n@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on television this week said , when the sc@@ ou@@ ting had fought in him , not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ ns appointment of pro@@ voc@@ able John Mc@@ Don@@ nell as the basic cler@@ k was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ s years when his old father lon@@ ged to be on television , il@@ legitimate towards his Labour cabinet , without losing too far and to lose his cabinet . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ dy &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight for &quot; &quot; to stay &quot; &quot; in all circumstances - Ben@@ ns express - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ nell said , nor what J@@ C told his collaborators and parliament@@ arians according to all reports on their proc@@ ess@@ ation on Monday night . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wishes - remember that he even stir@@ red me - News @-@ discipline is important in the Age of TV around the clock , and above all in the Stru@@ cture of Social Media , a brood @-@ care of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right , Cameron can give no open map for Europe that allowed him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the speech campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ nell told it . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins think surely so .
&quot; but , Mc@@ Don@@ nell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities in the EU membership , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among the left dissi@@ dents that is a central principle of dog@@ mati@@ cal disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities to Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to , in particular , to find a sense of their supervis@@ ors . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin want to waste political capital - they have even mis@@ trust@@ ful voters - to make concessions to the British if all this can be meaning@@ less ?
&quot; the US is already rather disappointed by weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , at which I was reminded at the start on Monday of something that British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum was called . &quot;
experts critici@@ ze report of Public Health England on e @-@ cigarettes
&quot; alleg@@ ations of state @-@ funded Agency that e @-@ cigarettes are less harmful than smoking developed from a meeting of 12 people , partially with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) joined The Lanc@@ et by posting the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigarettes applied .
&quot; p@@ he published the &quot; basic term &quot; in the past month , describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and commented on the connections between several experts and tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; a editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month reached the &quot; extra@@ ordinarily win@@ dy basis &quot; , &quot; on the p@@ he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the cont@@ en@@ tions are building on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public administration , Professor at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a basic principle of public health is that strategies on the detection of effectiveness should be based . &quot;
&quot; they said that the public is expected that &quot; &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigarettes is about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; &quot; based on a detailed review of the re@@ modelling and modelling . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 persons who were called to develop a model for multi@@ disciplinary criteria ( multi @-@ C@@ rit@@ eria Decision Analysis - M@@ C@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damages from various nicotine to one synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose director previously received by British American Tob@@ acco means ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote the references of BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting agreed to receive funding from an e @-@ cigarettes manufacturer , but not the funding they received after reports beforehand of the tobacco company Philip Morris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not supplied , but includes several known E @-@ cigarettes champi@@ ons , some of which also provide some industry funding in the paper . &quot;
some other participants in this session are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting the tobacco management of the p@@ he participated too .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ essed , &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damages of most products among most criteria &quot; , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or limitations in the p@@ he report will be discussed . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that there were no evidence that there have hitherto no evidence that e @-@ cigarettes should serve as a way to smoking for children or non @-@ smokers .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well @-@ being at p@@ he , said that the cont@@ en@@ tions of BM@@ J has already been responded to . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigarettes are substantially less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second life @-@ long smo@@ ker returns to his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggest that health risks of e cigarettes is low compared to that , but that we continue to have the long @-@ term effects to study . &quot;
&quot; the clear duty to inform the public about what is evidence of and what is not , especially when there are so much public confusion about relative dangers down to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 8@@ 0.000 people annually die at a disease with regard to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by clear proo@@ fs of current evidence that e @-@ cigarettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up the East@@ on , says Chief Chef of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; former Chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , has said the BBC should stop giving programs like East@@ on and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broad@@ cast@@ ers should only be used to make the kind of programs that are not sent by other UK channels .
he critici@@ zed the BBC for making them public @-@ legal programs which are likely to be viewed by a smaller audience in a tough cont@@ ested window of their ri@@ vals and of sen@@ ators such as BB@@ C@@ 4 .
&quot; after the BBC @-@ General Director , Tony Hall , said the company to do more in partnership with other organisations , Johnson said that he tried over six years in his time with channel 4 without success . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are on behalf or sends , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsidi@@ zed Riv@@ als , &quot; said Johnson the Bau@@ haus @-@ communication Committee under his investigation about the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broad@@ casting fee , which may be held in the medium or long term not for a good idea , you should at least make production at least one programs , the other do not do or commissioned . &quot;
&quot; they send the Voice in a first @-@ class window , because they want to achieve as broad support for their future as possible . &quot;
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridiculous it &apos;s natural nonsense . &quot;
Johnson said : &quot; I do not see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax programs could be financed without subsidies .
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ on is another , admittedly both original productions . &quot;
&quot; honestly , other channels would be their right arm for that . &quot;
I am trying to see myself how this should be public @-@ right television .
I do not believe that this would reduce the BBC ever .
&quot; Johnson , a business builder for series , who ran into Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to hunt for reviews &quot; &quot; because of the ambitions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular ship@@ ments of BBC show that again , what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart lecture in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows should sell like East@@ on . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal en@@ cycli@@ c programmes were supposed to go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , but they do not realize their tasks , and they can argue that they have created on their S@@ earch@@ missions for the justification of 4 billion £ . &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these ob@@ sc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
you place it in a window in which nobody wanted to see her .
&quot; on the broad@@ casting charge Johnson said to the board : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather eff@@ res@@ sive system regarding conditions that can give the best value in this . &quot;
&quot; of course , remember all , we all think that you get a great value for 150 £ per year , but for those who are 150 pounds for a lot of money , ask me if that &apos;s true , because they don &apos;t consume much on the BBC . &quot;
&quot; the former Sky@@ - und Channel 5 @-@ boss David El@@ stein , who also said in front of the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to review their Rei@@ th@@ ian mission to educate and maintain . &quot;
he said only little by the BBC @-@ production would now officially classi@@ fy as education - he said that it was 1 % of her TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and she should take an example of the publicly available TV broad@@ cast@@ ers in Australia and Canada .
&quot; the question of partnerships said El@@ stein , the BBC should do more in areas like that of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ O@@ uter@@ us &apos; can control brain cells by sound @-@ waves
&quot; the video shows how the Nem@@ i can change the direction in the moment , in which they are broadcast with sound @-@ impulses . &quot;
scientists have re@@ ared wor@@ ms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by re@@ armament of sound waves .
&quot; tiny ne@@ mat@@ o@@ des change the direction in the moment in which they are equipped with sound impulses , which have heard for human hearing on high frequencies , to be heard . &quot;
&quot; impulses are caused by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to enter the membrane channels using ultras@@ ound waves . &quot;
further on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the wor@@ ms showed the power of a new method , called Son@@ o Sizegenetics , where ultras@@ ound can be used to enable a number of brain , heart and muscle cells from outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researchers at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ olla , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the depths of brain output , a more invasive method , which provides electrical impulses in the brain of people for treating Park@@ inson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; F@@ aden@@ o@@ kes are usually not responding to ultras@@ ound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani reported that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ sc@@ op@@ ic air bub@@ bles . &quot;
&quot; the bub@@ bles , it found out , reinforce the ultras@@ ound @-@ waves , which then penetrate into the wor@@ ms . &quot;
the reinforced ultras@@ ound waves function in structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and be found in the membran@@ es of some of the wor@@ m@@ ots cells .
&quot; the sound @-@ waves distur@@ bs the opening of these channels , and activate the cells which they are assigned to , such a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultras@@ ound @-@ controlled ne@@ mat@@ ures , genetically modified Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically the wor@@ ms so that some of their mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons TR@@ P @-@ 4 channels . &quot;
&quot; when he uses ultras@@ ound among the changed creatures , the sound @-@ waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro @-@ pet@@ als , and transmitted to the wor@@ ms , where they turn off the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the process has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ Sizegenetics , a tra@@ il@@ bla@@ zing tool that enables scientists to incorporate neur@@ ons with impulses from light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani told that Son@@ o@@ yst@@ ers could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , that must be sent down to a optical fiber to the desired place in the brain , Ni@@ low frequency ultras@@ ound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent into the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the ange@@ y human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultras@@ ound signal in a clinical setting for certain neurological treatments , &quot; said Hal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could concentrate on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student dormit@@ ories
&quot; eleven years ago I moved to a student dormit@@ ory , still in a student dormit@@ ory , still in faith in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the tense smile of those who I anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ voice complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the move in student dormit@@ ories ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wr@@ acking down to absolutely fri@@ ghtening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to gl@@ oss : people describe how you come , where and where you get Sab@@ bat@@ arian where you are in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you are honest , Mar@@ mite , neither love nor hate , because in gravity , guys , it is but a fe@@ ather extra@@ kt ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
it distr@@ acts the conversation and helps you find out the people that you like in contrast to those you would not speak with even if your lashes in fire were consumed and these fire extingu@@ ishers .
let human beings .
&quot; people often turn into beverage recipes , film @-@ night venue and municipal meetings , but they are also places where people ti@@ ghten and wear their under@@ wear . &quot;
responding to : do not remember to begin at the university with a relationship
In@@ tro@@ ver@@ ted obtained a crude treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dormit@@ ories form a space @-@ to @-@ space lig@@ ament @-@ culture , which can be friendly and socially and lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
&quot; this can be hell for someone , who is trying to relax . &quot;
&quot; nothing in culture will allow you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship going on , but you must go away so that I can back the energy I used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to sense when a comb@@ at@@ one is exhausted from soci@@ alizing - and sending it an SMS rather than knock .
apro@@ pos anch@@ oring : do it .
&quot; a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea , that a did not dev@@ our door an invitation . &quot;
he saw some things .
friendship close by b@@ aking .
&quot; since you begin the university at the height of the back @-@ Man@@ ia , the knock on the doors of people to imagine yourself with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es , less wei@@ rd than the welcome of the 1950 @-@ er years &apos; welcome in the neighbourhood , I made you smile , so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
homemade treats is a good way to make friends .
&quot; your room@@ mates are feeling obliged to con@@ verse , and in the end might associate your face with a delicious surprise . &quot;
&quot; of course , this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker . &quot;
&quot; bad mixed lot of flour , sugar and fat are leading to people asking them sleeping when you drop off . &quot;
ste@@ al food is an essential crime in student dormit@@ ories .
&quot; of course , the cl@@ ut@@ ches of chicken is a lar@@ cen@@ y , but is it taking a drop of a drop for your tea too ? &quot;
check that with the D@@ airy propriet@@ or .
&quot; the chances are good they say to themselves , even if they cook in the inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als thy matters is annoying , and you have my compassion -- but try to cope well as my ten@@ ant , who added a washing @-@ up to her milk to pun@@ ish the th@@ iev@@ es . &quot;
she is now in prison .
&quot; they should not make noise , of the people from sleep or from work . &quot;
&quot; it is not only about being a decent man , but that in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ ver@@ er belong to the people who are sitting in the glass house . &quot;
&quot; a girl on my cor@@ ridors asked her neighbors , if it makes them something , drum and bass to put something more quiet , because it had three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they re@@ acted to this with even older music .
&quot; finally , when she finally heard at 5 am , she allowed her neighbors to sleep even two hours before she closed her own music , closed her door and made her three @-@ hour check . &quot;
would it not be romantic if your future spouse would enter random@@ ly into the same student dormit@@ ory ?
&quot; contr@@ ari@@ wise , it would not be far more embarrassing if you keep an room@@ mate for your future marriage co@@ ffe on her to re @-@ separate and then see them every day and maybe experience how they all come together with friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course the heart goes its own ways - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future marriage partnership , try to talk at least to talk about a bit of reason at least . &quot;
&quot; at the exciting moment in which you notice that somebody has its keys in his un@@ veiled room , the border between a Ul@@ k and Mob@@ bing f@@ einer , than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good argument is funny , but it only takes moments until he bo@@ omer@@ ang to the bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place by ver@@ aging a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but do never che@@ wing any one &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; close your door and place your keys in a glass of water , which you put in the freezer - but push your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for refugees , single @-@ burning , low @-@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate company Markus G@@ ild@@ ner builds in the Middle @-@ fran@@ k terrac@@ ed terrac@@ ed houses for people who do not have much money .
&quot; therefore , for instance , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living room , but also the only mother and the bar@@ ing@@ ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I show how to book today still cheap and well , &quot; &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in the interview &quot;
thousands of refugees are pushing for the flat market .
the entrepreneurs Markus G@@ ild@@ ner wants to know how quickly cheaper living space can be created : it builds in a project terrac@@ ed houses for refugees .
Lord G@@ ild@@ ner ; many refugees will be crow@@ ding in the construction market .
what solution do you offer ?
Markus G@@ ild@@ ner : mass accommodation in containers or athle@@ tic has no sustainability .
for men remain in a great part here .
&quot; given the refugee flow , we also need sufficient living space over the next couple of decades . &quot;
&quot; a very mund@@ ane , three @-@ storey town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
G@@ ild@@ ner : a town@@ house needs the least place .
it makes integration easier .
this is different when one takes man into living blocks .
&quot; each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a living room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be modified easily according to the respective needs .
how high are the cost ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : the price of 160 square meters living area per house is reduced to 18@@ 4 000 euro , without land . &quot;
this is straightforward .
six months the building took a long time .
this is appropriate .
so the building controls got their plans complicated ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : in legal conditions I have brought my project correctly .
&quot; particularly complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ narrow special structure and the Stell@@ ite Reg@@ ulations . &quot;
cre@@ ep@@ y .
&quot; it is still sub@@ ordinate , who creates three apartments in a terrac@@ ed house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is there a lack of space .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the inhabitants respond to their terrac@@ ed house ?
G@@ ild@@ ner : there were those who have accused me of creating new luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
what is definitely not true .
but ti@@ ghten you not the competitor to affordable housing ?
&quot; G@@ ild@@ ner : true : we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but luxury apartments , which barely can afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only mother or the ever @-@ deserved mother . &quot;
I show how to book today still cheap and well .
therefore it is about .

&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the installation app , tap into &quot; General &quot; and then select &quot; Software Update . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have stum@@ bled after the installation to problems as they receive a error message that transm@@ itters that the &quot; software update failed . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; to circum@@ vent the problem , users are advised to either wait until the advent goes back or trying to update on iTunes . &quot;
the telephone itself runs through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ eting of apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the prescri@@ ber of the updates . likewise , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then install it again as soon as the process is completed . &quot;
&quot; it is worthwhile to make sure that your mobile phone is loaded up during the update or is located near a charging system , so the battery is loaded . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , it won &apos;t be too low that the update will continue , since the phone could possibly be switched on half way and this could lead to a breakdown of the update . &quot;
read on : iOS 9 release still available on the schedule despite the Wat@@ ch@@ OS delay in checking iOS 9 : the least exciting but the best update of iOS 9 : how to prepare for the new iPhone operating system .
&quot; you should also make sure that you &apos;ve seen our chec@@ kl@@ ist of all things to prevent that things are going wrong and to protect themselves when they do it however . iOS 9 brings new functions , including a much more sophisticated personal assistant and enormous new productive features for the iPad , as well as changes that accelerate and restore the operating system . &quot;

&quot; witnesses seeks the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , against 23.@@ 45 , there were three young men walk from Bad So@@ den in the direction of Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one from the group , a 17 year old Afgh@@ an , followed by the police of his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called to them to wait for him . &quot;
at this time the group was on the level of the B@@ FT station .
on the premises of the gas station there were also three persons .
&quot; one of these men now cried out to the young , and hit it with the fist fits the face . &quot;
the victim has suffered a nose @-@ wearing and ble@@ eds heavily from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends were rus@@ hed and critic@@ ised on the bat , he let him go from his sacrifice . &quot;
from his friends the injured young man was now being brought home .
the wron@@ g@@ do@@ er followed the group with a passenger up to their home and drove across all of the demonstrations .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was once again attacked by the bat and another male person .
&quot; in the aid of a stroke , you check on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be brought to a hospital for medical care .
up to now is only a vag@@ u@@ ely T@@ age description .
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second r@@ ack@@ et should have been about 1.@@ 65 metres in size and was dressed with jeans and a brown white shirt .

Dr. Frank Müller takes practice Fel@@ se@@ ausen and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10000 Euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take on the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen .
&quot; he is also welcome to Sam@@ t@@ ag@@ lob@@ bies Bernd Bor@@ mann , Head of Uta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs Mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert . &quot;
in many places in the countryside doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf on the other hand are lucky : there will be taking part in practice Dr. Frank Müller on the 1st of October .
&quot; during Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ris@@ ausen in the retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is standing by Karl @-@ Heinrich His followers in the next months , and half @-@ up place . &quot;
&quot; following a construction phase , Müller opens the practice on October 12th until then it inv@@ ests 3@@ 10000 Euros in the premises at the St.@@ -@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
it was li@@ king at first sight to met Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l who currently took up their disciplines in the dener Hospital and will come into practice .
&quot; we always had in mind that the Mü@@ llers would fit well into this practice , &quot; &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ste@@ er and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was finally , I simply called it . &quot;
the couple Müller went the idea to continue to practice its own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; the closeness and the constant contact with the patients are very attractive for us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; we want to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
as an advantage he also sees his own boss to be .
and so one was agreed that the Mü@@ llers bought the house with practice .
stay will continue to live in Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen .
&quot; the two @-@ fold family @-@ father Frank Müller is also grown up , his medical studies in Hannover followed stations in several doctors practices , as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a pa@@ edi@@ atri@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , besides he was appointed for a leading doctor in the district of Di@@ ep@@ wood in 2009 and is participating in the DR@@ K @-@ readiness of Bru@@ ch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
the practice will be put on practice for the new Chief from September 19 .
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ste@@ al is working as a primary care physician , his wife has specialised in Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers , both Inter@@ nis@@ ts , want to settle for a general practitioner . &quot;
&quot; the end@@ os@@ copy comes out therefore , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
after the re@@ building the rooms will be modern .
we will offer more ultras@@ ound examinations and long @-@ term and exposure to plan and need a consultancy .
&quot; furthermore , the ED@@ V will be completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; the Mü@@ llers are received a total of 50@@ 000 Euro , as well as from the municipality of Spain ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and glad we are , that the practice continues to go forward , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ un@@ deb@@ tor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; about 2000 patients , according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , each quarter come into practice Fel@@ se@@ ausen , in the German @-@ German average practice of about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another general practitioner .
a positive side @-@ effect of the practical acceptance by Frank Müller : the dru@@ g@@ store remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ se@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , it would have been gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits the Mü@@ llers , is also talking mainly in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical colleges and the cleaning power of the fel@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; with their departure end in A@@ sen@@ dorf , an era , after all , the medi@@ cs have worked there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel cliffs can be remembered . &quot;
a little melanchol@@ y they feel after the long time already .
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and many patients will certainly still see , &quot; &quot; Inter@@ nis@@ tin &quot; &quot; says . &quot;
&quot; your husband comple@@ ment@@ ing : &quot; &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pushed against hor@@ ticul@@ ture , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ sons and travels to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees through &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also high on our border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mich@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain erect .
&quot; still , it is clear that anyone who wants to place an asylum application , this can also &quot; &quot; go &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people are in the foreground .
&quot; clearly , it is also clear that there are distinct signals needed , &quot; the ministries &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept unlimited migration flows , nor about the Austr@@ o @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia &apos;s guard &quot; Cor@@ ridor &quot; - Slovenia denied
the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to leave Slovenia for refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany and under certain circumstances have also cor@@ ridors for the refugees .
&quot; clearly this is the Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach but not . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the idea of cor@@ ridors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia is rather to intensify the surveillance of the border - above all to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia has already been severely controlled . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Sloven@@ e wants to seal the limits for refugees but not to seal . &quot;
&quot; every EU member must fill its commitments , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government claimed , the first refugees have already tried the Tuesday in the night hours , in Eastern Croatian on the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / Si@@ d , to so@@ ften the registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could draw them up in the near fields of corn .
&quot; according to local media , in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , the police vehicles were constantly faced with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , among them numerous women and children . &quot;
life@@ guards and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days his country will return to some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; buses from Pres@@ ses on the Maced@@ onian border , which were brought to the Hungarian border so far as far as Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday coinci@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade re@@ appears , however , that it may be that people would suggest certain routes : &quot; &quot; neither can we nor do we want it , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; according to the media report , however , a first bus with around 50 refugees arrived at the Ser@@ b border city Si@@ d , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; about Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the island mates were travelling all night away from the Maced@@ onian border by Serbia approximately 500 kilometres away .
&quot; we heard that Hungary made it , so the police declared that we should drive here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany by Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
this could actually be the predicted shift from the current Balkan Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Greece @-@ Serbia to a little further west .
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot;
&quot; Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic stressed , &quot; &quot; before that his country was prepared for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees . &quot;
&quot; details he did not , he pointed out that Croatia is not a non @-@ Schengen member &quot; complete possibilities for border control . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this case , you lead to stringent controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; Slovenia has belonged to this since 2007 , the EU partner since 2007 is a positive testimony from what affects the level of border controls since 2007 . &quot;
&quot; on ser@@ b@@ ish side , behind the Hungarian border fence there continues to be around 300 refugees . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade , the media reports the last night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , who leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
according to the Hungarian authorities the two border crossing Hor@@ gos and B@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed .
whether the remaining refugees want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian interior of the N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ ano@@ vic attempted to calm on Wednesday at a local show@@ piece in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed , for breakfast . &quot;
it would not be about very high refugees .
&quot; it could not be said if they would continue their journey to Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers for migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee camps have already begun to distribute the refugees on which alternative routes are shown in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area , there are also 20 years after the end of the Croatian war still not sp@@ elled min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of de@@ mining regions was sent in the border region .

&quot; in this way , the investig@@ ators were surve@@ yed over 100 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the present comparison reveals that even those outside our national borders are ultimately trapped in the &quot; &quot; S@@ EC Communication &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the trials against 32 other accus@@ ations in the case was continued .
most of the accused are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetrators should act out in both the United States and Eastern Europe .

also Peter Hü@@ b@@ inger is on the spot .

therefore this public @-@ effective action was good for 20 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; that not everyone wants to publicly share the tables publicly , but after all , it is a very personal matter . &quot;
&quot; death and dying is still frau@@ ght with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , even though the experience of Jose@@ fine Lam@@ mer , even though it has provided a lot to do with the hosp@@ ice movement in recent years that people open up . &quot;
a assessment that shares by Angel@@ ika Go@@ al roid .
the dying and funeral voice is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; by personal experience confronted with the subject , read them a lot of literature and decided to get involved in the eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; as the ec@@ umen@@ ical hosp@@ ice support , requested by call for volunteers , she immediately reported and was in the establishment in the year 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ Se@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the interested and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the hosp@@ ice @-@ Vincent . &quot;
they are all carefully trained .
Angel@@ ika Go@@ al roid can do well with her job and the experiences and experiences made with it .
&quot; I see life from another War@@ te , keep it for precious and este@@ emed the moment &quot; , &quot; she says . &quot;
an offer of gross ec@@ umen@@ ical service activities is free of charge and den@@ omin@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of depend@@ ants and associations enable the training as well as training and supervision of the mort@@ als and funeral institutes .

F@@ ed@@ Ex @-@ result mixed up Finance prospects for 2016
F@@ ed@@ Ex reports disappointing results for the final quarter and the Lie@@ ber giant lowered his profit view over a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his Bod@@ hi@@ ght service .
&quot; the company also said that she is planning to hire approximately 5@@ 5,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company wants to set out 50,000 pay@@ outs for the vacation time . &quot;
the shares fell over 2.5 percent at the market @-@ market 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 in the financial year that ends in May , 20 cent less than in the earlier pre@@ diction . &quot;
analysts were expecting a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ .
&quot; in spite of the price increases , an average of 4.@@ 9 percent is effective and effective on 4 January , despite higher rainf@@ all for heavy loads of heavy and large par@@ c@@ els , which will be charged from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said that it still expects the result compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher income , and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; solid income &quot; &quot; if you consider the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holidays employment were announced a day later than that of the Rival U@@ PS , who is planning to stop 90@@ ,000 up to 9@@ 5,000 additional labor force , approximately the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex served 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; the earnings per share stood at $ 2,@@ 42 $ per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 $ per share , the twelve of the Investment Bank Research Institute . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of the audience charged EUR 12.@@ 23 billion .
F@@ ed@@ Ex has gained a decline in international primary transmission over the last few years that brought its sales to st@@ agn@@ ant in its unity express transmission .
but the boom in online @-@ shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , sales increased by 29 per cent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express Unit recorded higher earnings based on higher prices , while the result for higher labour costs declined in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in Pre@@ market trade , about an hour before opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex stock decreased by 3.@@ 85 million , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 $ . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday they closed a 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent , under a record high on 11 June . &quot;

&quot; one end over them at one end of the completed , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed seat is a m@@ ural of the United States . &quot;
the map is remembering that the F@@ ed @-@ chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellas and her colleagues should put the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold assignment from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices 2015 .
but since the long recession the F@@ ed leaders have recognized that there is a third @-@ third mandate - financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight in order to pre@@ dict them . it &apos;s announced on Thursday , whether the U.S. economy is ready to offset by the immediate short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data of the economy show that it is solid , recent turbul@@ ences to global financial markets demonstrate the already cautious F@@ ed representatives anxious to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for Bundes@@ an@@ bor@@ row - and be it just about one @-@ quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation in first line will be the most important thing to observe , &quot; said Lin@@ d@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ists in the Mak@@ ler@@ y Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for an excuse to not increase the interest rate , the increased insecurity on global market has enough justification , continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do is un@@ secure in itself the financial market .
&quot; about half of econom@@ ists , recently interviewed by Bloomberg , have predicted that this week . &quot;
&quot; in the financial markets , however , the financial markets look forward to the F@@ ed with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance of an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market , if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strateg@@ ists l@@ essen the blow , by promising the fact that any further increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score at 22@@ 8.@@ 89 points or by 1,4 % at 16.@@ 5@@ 9@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , John Lon@@ ski , Chief Executive at Moo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise when the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this time , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does so , she would have to go very far in her statement in order to appe@@ ase the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
&quot; other experts have argued that an atom@@ isation would put down the financial markets , because it will remove the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act . &quot;
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared in good ways to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points per month , the first small step in a slow ag@@ gra@@ vation of mon@@ oton@@ ous conditions , which would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ella had said in the spring and in the early summer , despite the complaints from liber@@ als , that more economical progress would be required , an increase in the proposition . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of employment slo@@ wed in August , the improvement in the labour market was very solid . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate sank at 5,@@ 1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level that the F@@ ed considers as full employment . &quot;
wage boo@@ sts have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; and although inflation was continually transferred under the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed represent@@ ants said that the main reason is the temporary effect of clearly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can overcome higher interest rates and need it because of strain on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , Chief of the Paris Macro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world were together at the end of the last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage score fell in May by more than 16 % among its high@@ s , as investors feared that slo@@ wing down the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ ate global growth . &quot;
the market has recovered something in this month with the Dow is now around 10 % below the farm of May .
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market upheav@@ al affect the complex calculation as you should raise the interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy would not have occurred in recent weeks , Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ CL@@ A Zim@@ tu Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
&quot; now he pre@@ dict that she will wait at least one month to get the effects better . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what impacts on the U.S. economy will be , and there is almost no reliable data that describe the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , so it should not be included in their decision making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous during the last years .
&quot; the mere reference of the leadership of Ben S.@@ Bern@@ an@@ ke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could be &quot; &quot; tight &quot; &quot; expansion around the world . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly flowing with each other , they can monitor not only the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to get a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; their decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , Head of Global Strategy for assets of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeffrey L@@ acker , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions on financial market movements that are associated with apparently not associated with economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; L@@ acker , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to a single raise , obtained decisions in 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its benchmark interest by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions , despite limited recognis@@ able impact on growth in the US . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed represent@@ ants made this cuts und@@ o .
&quot; F@@ ed should focus on aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the P@@ re@@ unification in 2008 , Adam S. Posen , former member of the Committee on interest rates of the Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the recent turbul@@ ence do not come close to this level , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it certainly does not want to enter into the situation where they are afraid of a capital increase because markets are ex@@ changing , &quot; &quot; said Poznań , president of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act does not yet contain the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think they should hurry it . &quot;

Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ as@@ da : small Leben@@ shilfe for refugees
more and more refugees come to Germany in this day .
&quot; in order to prepare a warm welcome , not without the engagement of innumerable volunteers . &quot;
&quot; also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ as@@ da , there are quite a lot of people who can support the un@@ selfish asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
they belong to them Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is with body and soul teacher .
also with their 74 L@@ enses they are still taught .
every Thursday she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er at the D@@ ill@@ inger road .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdistan , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , the very different class is considered at a correct school . &quot;
Brazilian Society Rio Grande supports nutrition for healthy breastfeeding
Brazilian pa@@ edi@@ atric organization SP@@ RS tries to clear up women in a shocking way to inform women about how important good diet during the breastfeeding period is . she does this with the presentation of pictures of babies who are painted in frac@@ tures of unhealthy foods .
&quot; mother &apos;s milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that babies give all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; because of the additional energy requirements , pregnant and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research results indicate that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only di@@ ete@@ tic adaptation that mothers would make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Bay@@ lor College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet would actually fluctu@@ ate the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the child &apos;s unhealthy diet can neg@@ atively impact the immune system . &quot;
exceptions to the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ hall
the Bern@@ ried approved the construction entry for the 2.3 million Euro expensive sports hall .
and he was an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar installation .
the plans for the long @-@ seeing athle@@ te @-@ cultivation at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ tide come first step by step : during the recent common meeting the construction work was signed without major discussions .
&quot; before that , the Panel had decided to submit a request for an &apos; legislative &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; from valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; it was about permission for a special form in terms of roof construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , a &quot; saddle @-@ roof with non @-@ respectable first and roof level &quot; was set up . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof for solar facilities : &quot; &quot; by doing so we get a wonderfully large Sü@@ dd@@ ach together , &quot; explained Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger in the session . &quot;
&quot; liberation &quot; &quot; Again , on the other hand , was the an@@ a@@ version , which is required for energy reasons - different from the development plan - under ten degrees . &quot;
the volume of the hall is considerably reduced .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the development plan relating to the pit@@ ch@@ ement does not allow an &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der community tend to be more restric@@ tive in freedom of liberation . &quot;
&quot; however , it is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the athle@@ tic construction at the sports centre is a common project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; costs approximately 1,@@ 2,3 million euros . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and grass@@ roots sports .
the construction entry for the 18 x 36 metres large hall will now be submitted for the check @-@ up procedure for the 18 x 36 metres .
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the Hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is supposed to be closed earlier than planned - namely 2016 .
at the same time Dr Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) becomes the new Doc@@ tor and Hospital Manager at the Hospital Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the station as well as the majority of the employees are moving from P@@ ei@@ v@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , prior to the Land@@ s@@ esses Andrea Jo@@ wer @-@ White confirmed . &quot;
&quot; however , the Supervisory Board will vote on the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans are implemented , all of the nearly 50 employees in the hospital in P@@ ei@@ er@@ berg would continue to work . &quot;
the vast majority of sol@@ ves with fishermen and the further existing train station will move to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
the rooms are available .
&quot; the employees that cannot be transferred to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered in Wei@@ l@@ heim an workplace , such as Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
the staff are informed about plans .
&quot; triggered by the cancellation of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only become the recep@@ tor of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital and is now moving to a private office in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; the question of who is to commence our succession , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play according to Jo@@ xe @-@ white , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; into the game , who agreed to take the lead from October 1st and to move with his team to Sch@@ ong@@ au . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; &quot; upgrading &quot; &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the area of &quot; &quot; internal medicine &quot; , &quot; said Jo@@ chner @-@ White . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for p@@ ac@@ em@@ aker and de@@ fi@@ brill@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in the inner station on g@@ astro@@ enter@@ ologic disorders .
&quot; access to the next two years will be fisher@@ man with his team when the Supervisory Board agrees to agree both houses , until then next year the former hospital of Kn@@ app@@ liance , who has over 35 beds , is finally closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; so far , the county breed had planned this for 2018 , as the current refurb@@ ishment of the hospital Wei@@ l@@ heim has finished . &quot;
&quot; chair @-@ in @-@ white , which is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , appeared contrary to those who are owned by the Federal Reserve Board in future , to be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; the I close I out . as it goes with the property , Jo@@ in @-@ white could not tell , there are several reflections . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ time care of the Car@@ itas and a Tag@@ esp@@ sy@@ chi@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not return again , such as fishermen about the squee@@ ze , made by employees &quot; positive and very understanding . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where the fisher@@ man has been working as Chief Apostle since more than 30 years , did not exist . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleague to take over the post of medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ c berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened again and again in recent decades , departments were closed , for example the surgery and Obst@@ etri@@ cs . &quot;

refugees need accommodation : study warning of apartment gap
the situation in the German housing market is tense .
more and more refugees are looking for a payable place .
pressure on the construction market is growing .
social housing stands in front of a challenge .
distribution fights on the German construction market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market which is now over@@ loaded in many cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ minded citizens for the last affordable housing .
&quot; to cover the demand for affordable housing , we need to build 400@@ ,000 new units by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this result comes a study on behalf of the association &quot; &quot; social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , this year has been done in Germany 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units . &quot;
&quot; thus , there are no more than 140@@ ,000 apartments . &quot;
&quot; for the first three months of its stay , refugees are no longer committed to living as asylum seekers in an introductory accommodation . &quot;
many stum@@ ble then on the apartment market and were divided into the long queu@@ es in front of the flats .
&quot; according to Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers stays less than half of all asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the flat market should not only be paid to the rising refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ is@@ sions in the construction policy of recent years .
Germany : a residential deficit in front of itself that is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently , in the metropolitan areas , currently some 77@@ ,000 units , was compl@@ ained Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professional professions have therefore been rated in cities @-@ rated in WG @-@ rooms .
young adults remained un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly longer in the &quot; hotel Mama . &quot; because of the flu@@ ff in the apartment market .
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square metres per person has declined in recent years . &quot;
&quot; to solve the problem , the Alliance of social housing is proposing &quot; &quot; Rel@@ aun@@ ching Europe &quot; . &quot; &quot;
new incentives for social housing should be combined again .
&quot; thus , it could be avoided on the low@@ land transfer tax and the base tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments will be limited . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , according to alliance attractive tax sh@@ utt@@ les are necessary . &quot;
the promotion program for refugee shel@@ ters of the State Bank Kf@@ W is already working well in cities and towns .
&quot; a good week after the launch was reached in the assembly of 18@@ 4 million euros , more than half of the EUR 300 million available . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be opened up . &quot;
refugees have free articles : Croatia and Slovenia
&quot; Hungary is practically no going through , since more and more refugees choose the way about Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the journey through Slovenia to north with no hur@@ d@@ les .
&quot; however , the route is dangerous . &quot;
Croatia comm@@ its itself to the neighbouring Slovenia of Slovenia to set up a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said the Croatian interior minister Ran@@ ko O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and has already been a member of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ country Croatia is not a Schengen country .
&quot; after the shut@@ ters of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get from there to Western Europe . &quot;
500 people took over the border with T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik on the Croatian TV station RT@@ L .
Hungary had cast its border to refugees on the day before .
&quot; new laws that came into force the same day , ren@@ oun@@ ce grounds of asylum in Hungary are virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees happen .
Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ ano@@ vic stated : &quot; they can travel through and we prepare ourselves for this possibility .
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and to achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
the Croatian police had taken up the first refugees on the border of Serbia on the Croatian border in Croatia in the morning .
&quot; most of them came from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they arrived in both the bus and the Ser@@ b border line Si@@ d .
&quot; immediately after they arrived , they would have tried to walk on foot across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
on the Croatian @-@ Ser@@ b border the refugees encounter the border to the border .
this is the threshold of other dangers . there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
de@@ mining is meant to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; after Hungary , the closing of the border is hardly getting refugees . &quot;
on Tuesday the police officers came up with 38 persons .
&quot; just before the end of the Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws enhance overcoming and deterioration of the border line as a crime .
&quot; therefore , in the south @-@ Hungarian border city Sz@@ eged , there were therefore 35 criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; after a period of five years , the expul@@ sion is carried out from the country up to five years and the deportation from the country . &quot;
&quot; according to the Im@@ migration Off@@ ices , on Tuesday , in the newly established &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sessions &quot; &quot; took place on Tuesday , almost all - 93 - the most important transition to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants were 13 families with young children , as well as two older people . &quot;
on Wednesday morning another 40 refugees had stopped .
&quot; however , nobody has a prospect of getting asylum in Hungary asylum . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian view , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported back to the top .
the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ s were gathered together only a few hundred refugees .
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke the workers began to stir up .
they gathered the trash to mark the tens of thousands of people in the road@@ side during the last weeks .
pl@@ ain@@ es were dis@@ built and one of the re@@ inde@@ er at the border place was reconstructed .
nobody really wanted to express themselves as the aim of this super@@ structure .
Austria is only a few refugees after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary .
the country has also strengthened its border controls .
&quot; around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , approximately 1400 people are waiting for the drive to Germany . &quot;
train transport from there to Germany was stopped in the morning by the German public authorities .
in free@@ ze there met regularly smaller groups of refugees on foot .
Mayor of the mayor &quot; travelled &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy following the bridge in Sunday with the stor@@ ero@@ oms , when suddenly ten people were standing by travel companions at the entrance to the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ st@@ eins mayor of the town . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted by train to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had stepped up the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday because of the refugee flow , she was in W@@ ern@@ stein concludes , &quot; says the city that immediately offered his help and str@@ anded together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars on the border to the Near Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; before we had hoped , we had hoped , with J@@ ause and Be@@ ver@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; we have said the same way , we get them by car to Pass@@ au . &quot;
&quot; this was a matter of course for us , &quot; said the City Hall in O@@ Ö@@ N . &quot;
they were very grateful .
one man did not allow it to pass a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire@@ bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; this is really looking forward to us , &quot; says the city . &quot;
&quot; the following traction units were tra@@ ded on Sunday evening in Wels of a ICE in a regional train towards Pass@@ au , in order to recru@@ it it after the short notice that the railway traffic was stopped after Germany but still trying to try the border . &quot;
but the regional train was placed at the Inn in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn .
in W@@ ern@@ stein the border @-@ border is generally high in the course .
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bav@@ arian neighbors on Sunday soci@@ ably , days before a two @-@ ring sp@@ lash - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án now sends further tens of thousands of thousands of thousands , is a logical result of a virtual policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the construction of structures that ensure human@@ eness , our Chancellor declared officially and publicly the position of the Hungarian government in the m@@ ist of National Socialism . &quot;
ly@@ we@@ bin@@ s of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted in the bor@@ der@@ ers with chaotic states .
&quot; the refugee will also have to determine that the &quot; &quot; ob@@ liter@@ ated land &quot; , &quot; which she invited and welcomed nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a huge challenge , in the light of the ongoing refugee streams and the close winter , with us decent conditions for the protection of human rights . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ rad in search of 3@@ 5,000 hibernation &quot;
&quot; finally , the declaration put all hands to do with the refugees . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to have his word weight .
the government has used the former mighty Rai@@ ff@@ e@@ isen ban@@ kers to raise awareness for thousands of refugees .
the chaos in the premi@@ er Centre Tr@@ is@@ kirchen has already got a grip on .
&quot; we have no homeless more in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was without great turmoil , &quot; &quot; Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; &quot; master @-@ performance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in contrast , the Interior Ministry was in contrast to an &quot; threatening situation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; overall , there are a total of 8@@ 5,000 items in the he@@ ur@@ ring year . &quot;
&quot; to meet the number , we have to find $ 35@@ ,000 shel@@ ters in the next few weeks - 20,000 , the countries are supposed to be available , 15,000 . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; Konrad . &quot;
he has already conducted talks with the governor .
they could have assured to him also to make lod@@ gings for the coming refugees too .
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ atar is supported by Konrad .
&quot; in the morning a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Scho@@ born will give , thereby it shall be settled , as the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; great expectations will continue the asylum @-@ ordinator as well as the OR@@ F &quot; &quot; helping &quot; &quot; action like us . &quot;
private persons and services can be provided on the platform .
&quot; additionally , you hope at hotels that are empty during the winter time . &quot;
&quot; finally , Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed yesterday the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that lod@@ gings must respect a certain amount of the handle holder or the size of the so@@ ber . &quot;
for a temporary period &quot; time &quot; would have to apply .
&quot; that in contrast to the Interior Ministry , he is more successful in accommodation , Konrad with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentleman , which one does not say without further into the face of the fal@@ se@@ hood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is his most important weapon .
&quot; Con@@ rad and Mai@@ er do not cause the republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
your employees want to increase them to three to four .
your own lod@@ gings was not yet successful until now .
Konrad wanted to put a container on Steph@@ an@@ splatz in the office .
but apparently there are some problems with the permit .
Linz demand a better division
&quot; at present , no opening of the municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and Design Center for placing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary , as one could accommodate the people currently without these actions , says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; however , in case of an emergency , other sites are expected to be checked for their de@@ port@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the Gover@@ nor at the division of refugees inside the Federal Republic .
other districts must also contribute to this post .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer : &quot; borders are not un@@ sealed &quot;
in a longer call with the Bav@@ arian ministry to Horst Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ( CS@@ U ) as the Monday the further steps in the refugee world has acc@@ eded .
Se@@ eh@@ o@@ fer ass@@ ures me that the German borders are not sealed .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
however there will now be the corresponding border controls .
special copies with refugees to Germany will no longer exist .
but the seekers would however be brought to Germany with regular moves .
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ urg@@ inger was once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee question . &quot;
&quot; that Austria once again leads to its borders , it is a logical consequence of the action of the Germans for P@@ it@@ ars . &quot;
the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is a question of time
&quot; the &quot; &quot; New ship@@ yard &quot; &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industry line is officially completed . &quot;
&quot; in four of the six floors of office and production building , the stock market is drawn into the stock ( 2@@ 700 square meter ) , and the rest ( 2@@ 700 square meters ) should be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT the clever ones are our raw material - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T leader Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in Star@@ tup from the New ship@@ yard and later to become qui@@ eter .
&quot; right from the start , S &amp; T wants to co @-@ operate with the new neighbors - of which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises many things : &quot; the next Run@@ tas@@ tic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million Euro were invested by S &amp; T in the location of 3,@@ 3 million euros from the Tech@@ center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Confederation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is p@@ ayed by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 2@@ 700 @-@ square meter stretch in the building have already rented , for a further 40 percent give it requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni &apos;s owner opened a second shop in the ar@@ cades
in the new shop Fur@@ la pur@@ se is at the centre of attention .
&quot; actually , J@@ utta was eager to gain a dog . &quot;
this project had to rise up the 49 @-@ year @-@ old consultant of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ market ar@@ cades . after all she has gained growth in the form of another business location .
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop over the shop , in which it sells among other pockets , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing of different manufacturers , all round about hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , pur@@ ses are available from 75 Euro . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
since yesterday the new shop is in operation .
previously several weeks have been rebuilt .
&quot; but I have passed a long time if I should open a store , &quot; &quot; says broadly . &quot;
&quot; decisive for the decision was among other things , that also the Fur@@ la producers who are in Bologna at home , from the idea of an own location where only their pur@@ ses were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the mer@@ ciful in the Greater Linz , who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who own himself Italian roots . &quot;
your mother &apos;s interest has been widely received by her mother in the cradle .
I &apos;m deaf when something develops and I can show new trends for performance prices .
why so some woman in sight of a beautiful hand@@ bag was prophes@@ ying on erection problems , the professional wife can not answer with the last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a nice bag is enhanced each out@@ fit .
the Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
&quot; the Pf@@ al@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose citizens are called An@@ ders . &quot;
this characteristic also connects some to the billi@@ on@@ aire , the US president wants to become . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for excitement .
&quot; whether it is not reflected by xen@@ opho@@ bic , journalists , or knowledge gaps in the international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential system boo@@ sts the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and also cuts fine .
&quot; this is also registered in the pf@@ äl@@ z@@ isches K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grandparents &apos; grandparents were origin@@ ating from the real estates . &quot;
the New Yorker with the Com@@ promise inc@@ ur is many in the wine @-@ village at the wine @-@ road a term .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant place is related to -@@ zig corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Palat@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in the election campaign . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ ot@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del turned a movie about p@@ umping .
and what do villagers think about their goal to become the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they &apos;re all exciting somehow , but are not so deeply impressed in their han@@ se@@ stad@@ art . &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
the native K@@ all@@ ot@@ ter has made a am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous offspring in which next to Tr@@ ump also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up @-@ Family Heinz belongs .
&quot; dump , which is not known for modest , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) even to speak - so with the statement that he would certainly also be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the King of the hearts .
&quot; though there was respect for the performance of the family , but also tends to say that Tr@@ ump &quot; is a bit of a big mouth , &quot; &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; coinci@@ ded the nickname of the nickname , the k@@ all@@ stadt in the district , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ul@@ l@@ jes@@ macher &quot; - towards high level : the gi@@ ver , says it . &quot;
Tr@@ ump comes from the village of don@@ or .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;s success story began in 1885 when the later grandfather emigr@@ ated and opened a restaurant for gol@@ fers in the USA .
found@@ ational property of the property company were the first piece of re@@ plac@@ ings in New York .
&quot; the life of the grandparents was not free of tragedy , their desire to return to the back to the homeland , failed in the Bav@@ arian state , to which the Palat@@ inate was back then . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump , because he was once left without permission , the director of the Institute for pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ily &apos;s history and Folklore , Roland Paul , at the film start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emi@@ grant . &quot;
this is in contrast to the sometimes marked statements of the descendants .
who had repeatedly discussed the Mexican immigrants in the US and called for the construction of a boundary wall to prevent illegal immigrants .
&quot; just like the pol@@ arization , this is not so sympathetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a for@@ ter of kin@@ dre@@ ary ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tr@@ ump , the op@@ a was born @-@ born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the winem@@ akers have retired from the Americans rather dist@@ ancing the American , &quot; &quot; he is always so small . &quot;
does he believe that Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I cannot imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never looked after K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the Pen@@ sion@@ um@@ tin Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ r@@ amm is mentioned as man@@ cher K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a desc@@ endant of the family Heinz with a visit did something for the ch@@ ur@@ ch@@ ins which was generally well connected .
&quot; that can I not imagine of the Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they make it better if he doesn &apos;t know the choice , for &quot; &quot; he has such a radical view , I don &apos;t know if it &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had been in the US at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , he had never arrived there at all . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ro@@ man Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president ap@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , which was interviewed for the dump long , have seen 12 000 Kin@@ o@@ ers , also in the USA awak@@ ens interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavaria municipality of Ram@@ sau in Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the Vice @-@ President of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the national park Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den , received the award for gentle tourism . &quot;
in Austria there are already 20 &quot; mountain villages . &quot;
in the neighbouring country the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award .
a &quot; mountain village &quot; can have a maximum of 2500 residents .
at least one fifth of its surface must be interpreted as protection .
&quot; Seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the ratings , despite the attempts of Nine , manage the loss of leadership at the today show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ ano@@ vic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son to tell Can@@ ber@@ ra , in connection with the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but has provided no major discre@@ pan@@ cies with the reviews for today . &quot;
&quot; the breakfast @-@ show of Nine was aired by the state of capital , as Mal@@ col@@ m turn@@ bull managed the overthrow of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t . &quot;
&quot; rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Samantha Ar@@ my@@ tage , put in London as part of one week @-@ long series of international television programs , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cun . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the board appeared to play no part for the Australian TV spectators , since Sun@@ rise generated average 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators in the five capitals , compared to the report today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today a slight increase in ratings on Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ ,000 ) but his number remained behind the last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today in the last months today the gap of Sun@@ rise has closed .
&quot; in August today , at the average 3@@ 18@@ ,000 achieved an average of 33@@ 0.000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; up to now in September Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 at today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ al of the render to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama of a recently we@@ ather@@ ed father , who decides to settle with his two children at the New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached an impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics did ask if I could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening was rep@@ lied with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million spectators and hit easily The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ B@@ L ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
Seven had mixed results in evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17,@@ 30 ) of the new Quiz show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ e@@ fe flo@@ wed on average 44@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
half an hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) j@@ umped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the Monday night the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia was about 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour s@@ atte 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;

&quot; the last three agree to that , Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ? &quot;
secret is un@@ veiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki probably have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly manifest who The Bachelor is winning . &quot;
&quot; finally , the woman , who landed in The Bachelor in The Bachelor , was wrapped in largest secrecy . &quot;
none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal if they are the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows on the day , before coming out of three two , you might have accidentally written a note who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood continues his lips until the finals on Thursday sealed
&quot; all three women have om@@ itted in ly@@ ric way , why wood is the perfect man and called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude towards why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who was supposed to get the last rose ? &quot; , &quot; her answers to the game @-@ kill@@ joy would become who won the heart of the Bachelor &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , and Mark@@ os@@ ki said both quickly - except for himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had an easy relationship from the first day on .
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and ( Sarah &apos;s ) and Sam@@ s energies noted , I sen@@ sed that they were quite compatible and I have all thought throughout the course of the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah stands with both feet on earth , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood as a couple are well suited .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the house was last week made her clear that wood &quot; &quot; could be &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family it was clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am un@@ condition@@ ally adjusted to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked , whom Wood should vote , if not her , he was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I do not know if I can say this , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girl alike - it is a tie between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 19 : 30 p.m. , on Ten . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in moving to the U.S. - and there were many other teams that sent requests to his monumental training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ s@@ ula and it looks like a wise choice .
&quot; some coach would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game onto the bench when he lost an angel , as it lost the Aussie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by @-@ League @-@ Conver@@ ters with his first pun@@ t @-@ return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minnesota . &quot;
&quot; but Tom@@ s@@ ula trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next chance to take a pun@@ t return , and also in the ongoing game following an injury of Reg@@ gie Bush . &quot;
Tom@@ s@@ ula also showed his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
&quot; Tom@@ s@@ ula strengthened Hay@@ ne , also publicly in his press conference after the game . &quot;
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ mor Cam In@@ one reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by the specialist teams coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his p@@ atz@@ ten mu@@ zzle and take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne , with a pun@@ t , restored in the first season of Minnesota , was restored by the Minnesota Vi@@ kings . &quot;
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and its massive Australian relief for his N@@ FL debut . &quot;
Hay@@ ne left the playground following the F@@ um@@ ble flu@@ ch@@ end the playing field and later re@@ marked the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy at 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a worse start to his N@@ FL .
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; Hay@@ ne said . &quot;
Hay@@ ne moved the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in Deb@@ made in 2007 when a pass has led to a T@@ ry for Queensland in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area .
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; the Free voters are calling for the high refugee quot@@ as for the hi@@ ring of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W @-@ autumn sh@@ utt@@ ings at the start of a serious crisis at Bay@@ erns schools , when there is no more than 1,000 additional teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 additional teachers in order to protect schools from collapse &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get ent@@ gra@@ dations in the Bav@@ arian education system . &quot;
the Free Zone Citizens held to Friday in the fran@@ con@@ ian community .
&quot; actually , all other main themes were provided . &quot;
but the record number of refugees also dominates the free vot@@ er meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ store the clause &quot; , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded the establishment of Nations protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as it existed during the Yugoslavia in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; it is no further that we have to go to the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters boss . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers do not want to de@@ port the Free voters as quickly as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the governing courts that are responsible for asylum . &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum @-@ ters , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W leader critici@@ zed that several federal states are not consistent : &quot; &quot; we need fundamental consistent standards of the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sin@@ ks off , others not . &quot;
&quot; because we need to act manually . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the country &apos;s national policy should not fall under the table under the table . &quot;
one years of continuous N@@ ever@@ gre@@ ens remain on the agenda of the agenda .
&quot; for the new school year Kul@@ tus@@ minister Ludwig Wei@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) at 47 g@@ ymnasi@@ ums paid the pilot attempt , plus , in which an extension of g@@ ymnasium is to be tested from three to four years - in the result it will take nine years to the SL@@ C . &quot;
but that is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W leader . &quot;
we are calling for freedom of freedom for the higher level of colleges that want this .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 anywhere , where it is desired . &quot;

&quot; many stock exchanges are expected to make the markets up to the interest rate in the U.S. , and also for a large fall at the schedules to this Friday . &quot;
&quot; the discussion about the loads from the nuclear issue has made the shares of RW@@ E temporarily on a record , low down and also on eon deep tracks . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; Spiegel &quot; &quot; they are missing 30 billion euros to the German energy group . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the figures quoted in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered something , but always lost 3.2 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( eon ) . &quot;
&quot; Infin@@ eon shares increased at the D@@ ax tip by another 3,@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a retailer , a positive report from the U.S. &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; came from the weekend . &quot;

the pension index rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the association @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; the course of the euro sank in the afternoon , at least 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;
&quot; against noon , the European Central Bank had fixed the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the dollar cost thus 0,@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0,@@ 88@@ 75 ) euro . &quot;
4 People killed when poli@@ cem@@ an @-@ fin on demonstr@@ ators in Nepal shoot
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police force in a crowd , demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , said a civil servant on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the force left the service evening in the district of R@@ up@@ an@@ de@@ hi , about 175 miles west of the capital city of Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leading District officials said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside of the police station , with some of you put stones and burned @-@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police have used Tr@@ ab@@ eng@@ as and then shot up into the air before it resor@@ ting to rubber .
20 poli@@ c@@ emen and five civilians were injured .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known by those that can kill them , but are traditionally used as less deadly alternative , apparently a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the discussion was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nep@@ alese southern levels , where members of the ethnic group of Mad@@ ei@@ i say that new provinces , which would reduce as part of the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
protests in the western Nepal were also the ethnic group of the Th@@ u who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been subjected to violent conflicts since the 10 . &quot;
&quot; August killed , when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution but a very much controversial issue in Nepal , which has been ruled by centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lat@@ ure accelerated the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lat@@ ure passed this week by certain cl@@ auses in the Constitutional Court , and officials said that the new constitution could enter into force on Sunday . &quot;

Em@@ den - The town Em@@ den wants to market an approximately 4000 square meters of land in direct proximity to the youth centre of Old Post .
the preparations for this are underway .
&quot; the terrain is planned for a mix of trade , commercial and living . &quot;
&quot; wait for appropriate offers , says it from the city . &quot;
which investor @-@ question was still not clear yet .
&quot; accordingly , no agreements have yet been closed . &quot;
&quot; the town Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is on the ring road / corner of Great Street , already purchased a few months ago and to tear the opposite building . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday house on the little sea at Em@@ den took shape .
the investor presented publicly his first public plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further troubled - they fear the sale of their leisure activity
&quot; T.@@ T.@@ I. was left behind closed doors , p@@ onder@@ ing , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea are next to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the prospective , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den @-@ System &quot; &quot; Building &quot; , &quot; presented his plans for the first time on Monday night in the urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the order of the order on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under the pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ung out of the system @-@ building management board the offensive : &quot; we do not have an answer to all questions , &quot; he said above the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
&quot; however , it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ors now . &quot;
&quot; for months , that has been around ten to twelve million Euro per project , and has been in discussion for months . &quot;
violent reactions from Meer@@ bu@@ den@@ ces who came to the session called the pictures and the new details of the desired hotel building .
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea @-@ owner and board member with an interest granted by the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , laments : &quot; this is a giant cl@@ ot@@ z which overlooks the other building . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critics , that traffic through the intended size of the plant would increase greatly : &quot; there must come all bus inv@@ itations so that it is worth &quot; , &quot; said Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; what happens exactly in the well one hect@@ are of a real estate site , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a conclu@@ sive concept present , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Not@@ hr@@ am . &quot;
&quot; because this even was missing , the development plans are still more variable . &quot;

Google may start double @-@ raising donations to collect 11 million $ for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a dup@@ lication campaign to bring 11 million $ to humanitarian organizations that will help the European nations to flee the European nations , as they flee from the war torn apart and impover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach in the disclosure of donations to his blog .

&quot; to our journey we belonged to many dark railway and bus trips , as well as hunger , thir@@ st , cold and fear , &quot; wrote them . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis in Europe has grown , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing aid for refugees and migrants : doctors without borders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to € 5.5 million in google@@ .com / Pacific relief to 11 million $ .

for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics may be helpful loss of loss .
the advantages of weight loss surgery for slightly overweight people with type 2 diabetes may last for a new study at least five years .
it is still too early to say whether slightly overweight people are living with diabetes after the weight loss surgery longer than those who do not have @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality rates require a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert of weight loss surgery , who wrote a editorial written about the new study in J@@ ama Surgery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years adi@@ posit@@ as operations have been proven for treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out by people who are from 35 or higher with a Body @-@ Mass Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a degree of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that anyone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered to be obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , researchers from Tai@@ w@@ ans min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity and gast@@ ric formation - for treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who undergo this surgery declined from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; the BM@@ I was with those , the non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments , and approximately with 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who are subject to surgical procedure , at least 36 % the diabetes disease is completely and at 28 % partially . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , the type of diabetes was completely dissolved by one percent and in part with only approximately two percent . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the results were better with the controls of blood pressure , the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL Cholester@@ ols &quot; generally better than the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitor the patient blood levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best held under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level declined by about 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , in the medical treatment group it remained stable with approximately 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but these better &quot; gly@@ cem@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - reduced does not decrease mortality in five years , so the introductory researcher Dr. chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also reported average results in the two types of the surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , achieved bigger decl@@ ines in BM@@ I ( 7,@@ 1 % vs. 2.2 % ) and recorded a complete change of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of the surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of he@@ avier people in Sweden that surgery results to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study it was carried out at obes@@ e people , who undergo a obesity surgery , about 29 per cent less likely to die during 15 years - compared to a group , conventional methods of conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study did not prove an advantage for survival in the patient &apos;s surgery , Black@@ stone said it was re@@ ass@@ uring for people with a BM@@ I among 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical aspect of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , without elevated risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start to take weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long before we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have linked their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;

&quot; in addition , the novel is likely to be of interest to H@@ uns@@ rück readers , as he is playing in Lang@@ wei@@ ler and the surrounding villages . &quot;

it is impossible that everyone to come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe could not record all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East lie . &quot;
the Tibetan @-@ Buddhist guide demanded to end violence in the home countries of refugees .
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of long @-@ lasting refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit in the United Kingdom in his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford to be dedicated to eth@@ ic studies .
&quot; in the given circumstances , he called for the interests of humanity to be placed against the interests of individual nations or even continents . &quot;
he also stressed that the reaction of Western European countries is admir@@ able for the refugee crisis but the situation is not adequate .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you have to think about long term solutions as a genuine peace and genuine development , mainly by education , for these Muslim countries can be created . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we must think about how killing in their countries is dimin@@ ished . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also comment@@ ed@@ on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack of September 11 and turned out that the violent response of the US moved a chain from un@@ contro@@ ll@@ able events .
I expressed my sympath@@ ies in a letter to President Bush after September 11 and I said to him the way to solve this problem lies in non @-@ violence .
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put authority over and that has brought forth bad consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
quadru@@ ple increase of intake of te@@ di@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the last 4 years
&quot; control centers in the US report on an almost 400 % increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , the strongly alcoholic and dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Gay@@ lord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , the cases of revenues of to@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years have reported the Gi@@ ft@@ most controversial centres , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them are going in the emergency , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
&quot; he said that some children of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants can inten@@ tionally drink , while some people do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media . &quot;
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers have said to be inf@@ used dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with soft mouth@@ wash water to get a tougher beverage .
younger children can be instruc@@ ted from attractive cul@@ ants of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are par@@ able .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and oran@@ ges , which are very appealing to children . &quot;
goods dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
especially with small children can already have few sp@@ lash out for alco@@ hol@@ is@@ poison@@ ing .
&quot; it is highly focused alcohol , &quot; &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , Doc@@ tor Director of the Po@@ ison Centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you would not have a sip of whis@@ ky pan@@ ky , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children and if children arrive at it , then it &apos;s a quick way to consume much of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Russell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four spra@@ ys of according to straw@@ berry du@@ f@@ ten@@ ders in school was taken into an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; your blood @-@ concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is considered by a adult by law than drunk , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , who treated them at the G@@ ump@@ nett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ apped her words and was not able to go , when she came up in the ER @-@ up . &quot;
doctors were monitoring them overnight in a separate children hospital at signs of Hir@@ n @-@ trau@@ ma because the girl had fallen by the alcohol and stum@@ bled upon his head was Rit@@ ch@@ ey .
&quot; this was very wor@@ ris@@ ome , &quot; &quot; told Ort@@ oria Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ahs mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
about alcohol po@@ is@@ oned out there were some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants associated with deaths .
&quot; in 2013 two women died in Ontario women after the si@@ pping of Hän@@ de@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; members of healthcare agencies assume that the product meth@@ anol contained , a deadly solution , rather than eth@@ anol , who was noted as substance . &quot;
&quot; in January he planned three students of the fourth class in the state of New York , their &quot; &quot; kidn@@ apping &quot; &quot; teacher by po@@ ison by anti @-@ bacterial products all around the educational space , &quot; announces it a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to res@@ ti@@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and secur@@ es them from their room .
the police regarded the accomplished plan as &quot; Gesch@@ af@@ tz &quot; and &quot; rejected multi@@ disciplinary action to the school authorities .

the lack of a title competition in the Scottish football fake low@@ lands - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former ranking player and former national player from the Netherlands Ronald de Bo@@ er pointed out that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , as there is no title @-@ rival@@ ry with the Rang@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an Ambassador of Ajax , said : &quot; in Holland they show no highlights of the Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the Rang@@ ers are not there .
people here do not just talk about the return of the Rang@@ ers .
they speak about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old Fir@@ m games , and it &apos;s not just the people of Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn the things around , sw@@ am di@@ la . &quot;
Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight but the Norwegian boss sw@@ amp to turn things around .
&quot; after the defeat of Malmö and the subsequent departure from the Champions League , the defeat was followed against 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , which now stand very clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; however , Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had previously been bad times before , and we will come again . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it is very frustrating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what &apos;s happening . &quot;
we feel this exactly - but we must go on .
&quot; we really need the support provided by Celtic , because that gives the player better . &quot;
to work together is so important .

unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the UK it altogether rises .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole has increased in the same period by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million . &quot;
Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate from 5.@@ 9 percent was over 5.5 per cent higher than the number of the offices for National Statisti@@ cs ( ONS ) .
&quot; in the meantime , jobs in Scotland fell around 12.@@ 000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2.@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.@@ 0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3,5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said , &quot; The long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;

why I will be a witness of the Exec@@ ution in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma
&quot; somewhat later , except for a late legal intervention , I will watch on how to put a man to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope that it is not happening , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the chamber chamber in O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ sip are ex@@ iled by the tox@@ ins . &quot;
he has asked me to be one of the four official witnesses in his death .
&quot; the invitation was first performed in January about its best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day came closer , I began to fear . &quot;
&quot; so , why should I do it ? &quot;
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US and as often more applications are available as places , find a down@@ ward lottery instead of deciding who is elected . &quot;
O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
who is selected will be watching it emotion@@ ally .
I cannot do that .
&quot; besides Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest to me , I will have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visiting . &quot;
I like the guy .
we laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so it will not be allowed to take a notebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist of O@@ kl@@ ah@@ oma accused me on Twitter , my im@@ parti@@ ality . &quot;
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner as he wants it and you get access .
I describe myself with her .
&quot; they spatial such that &quot; &quot; it could have been better able to form@@ ulate , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong with what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ sip had problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he didn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I would not do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
&quot; but he wants that an international re@@ porter is present , to write there . &quot;
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help against the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please hear the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back here again to all details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ a is inno@@ cent .
his acts according to the assassination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty to be a benefici@@ ary &apos;s act .
&quot; but I believe that a strong probability , that it is not guilty of the murder . &quot;
I believe it is not enough evidence to justify a death place .
I believe that his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can turn to .
&quot; what you will receive from me is , what it is said to die a man giving an unnecessary death . &quot;

&quot; in 2006 , C@@ ous@@ ins went to his car in the dit@@ ch to escape a alcohol control and then tried to swim over the Swan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired local ones to the hum@@ orous planning of Ben C@@ ous@@ ins @-@ Bi@@ ath@@ lon .
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards trying to raise him and kick off racing
Peter Moo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of racing Victoria tried to have tried a sp@@ y in his stables for the past year and im@@ ated the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed to ste@@ wards and the integrity of the Racing Victoria and maintained that she had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy &apos;s said , Fair@@ fax Media that he has always tried to do that which is best for racing and he himself found himself under difficult conditions , when it comes to the positive Kob@@ alt T@@ up@@ fer@@ s@@ rehearsal with Li@@ dar@@ is he could not explain . &quot;
&quot; he had kept herself back 18 months because of the sp@@ ying alleg@@ ations , and did not want to see that &quot; I see it as being too high @-@ cal@@ ming grapes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I had to say nothing about it and I &apos;ve done a long time on it , but sometimes you are frustrated that everything gets out again , &quot; Moo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it is widespread .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I would like to walk about my heart , and I want my owners think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they begin to think , I do not do that , then I should not be a coach . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to think of what I do with my license .
&quot; previously Moo@@ dy had lifted the bomb in an interview with rac@@ ing.com , that the Integr@@ ated Department had tried to raise its stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bai@@ ley , Day@@ le Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - I will design@@ ate when I asked - and offered him employment in my stables for providing information about what I do inside my stables , &quot; said Moo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing.com . &quot;
they believe that I am a che@@ at .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because in the attempt to grasp me , they have failed . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , eh@@ em . Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David Moo@@ die , official President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ und@@ ry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still alive today . &quot;
should I bring this to the view that it is personally ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave and makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is happening in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking out there that I am .
&quot; perhaps they must take my license and rejected me , and I have no doubt that what I say to them now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care about , and I am sorry . &quot;
this really makes me sad .
&quot; I will exercise pressure on them , and push them to make a decision . &quot;
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the frustration rate of the trainer got up with the long @-@ lasting Cob@@ alt examination at Li@@ dar@@ i , and the L@@ ate Scr@@ at@@ ching took that he could throw his license on the table . &quot;
&quot; Moo@@ dy the best known because of his preparation of the un@@ earth@@ ed master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , the race &quot; &quot; treat &quot; &quot; was ridiculous after a pack mud or sound had been obs@@ cured in the horseback ride . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is against the rules of racing . &quot;
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my employees has er@@ ron@@ eous s@@ lu@@ dge on the leg to wear .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the whole day yesterday as it was .
but it also had such a race day .
Moo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack of the race day . an examination of this affair has been opened .
it is a joke .
&quot; set up these rules , do not know anything about the horse . &quot;
&quot; we all see that we need rules but here one has gone too far , &quot; Moo@@ dy . &quot;

Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy beat against ri@@ vals for cont@@ en@@ tions to ring cont@@ entment
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Craig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the T@@ Sl@@ ing of its players as &quot; agenda Set@@ ting &quot; of two Premier League &apos;s favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney Roo@@ ster trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson told that the arbitr@@ ators have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm Sieg@@ s in Sydney on Friday night .
&quot; Bris@@ bane bron@@ cos Trainer Way@@ ne Ben@@ nett has made a barely infl@@ at@@ oned note to the Storm Team , after his team achieved the final victory against North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two out of Queensland was not &quot; good &quot; in R@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy , the t@@ ack@@ lim@@ g of its crew and said they were concentrating on their &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at the T@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers to his team give him confidence , because it was hur@@ ting that they were worried about being struck by the Storm Team . &quot;
&quot; this always emerges , I did not say that Tr@@ ent Robinson about ring fights , when they took us 24 : 2 , &quot; says Bell@@ y@@ on Wednesday . &quot;
I can guarantee that throughout the year we have changed nothing to our defensive system or techniques . but over the last six weeks we have done our contact with T@@ LA@@ R to a real focus and this is the turn@@ around .
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and he obviously has a great team to train . he is therefore probably not accustomed to lose it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s strange how this time is again emerging again at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy thought about &quot; exciting football &quot; from &quot; exciting football , &quot; and reminded his ment@@ or that Ben@@ nett St George Il@@ ly war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football . &quot;
Way@@ ne talks about exciting football .
&quot; he has compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday night and how exciting their play was , &quot; says Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in the year 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Way@@ ne said he will take care of a trick . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and watch the game as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
that &apos;s the ball game you want to play if you have this kind of player .
&quot; he did this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his way of playing soccer - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , making them play as they play . &quot;
&quot; I have stronger confidence because they say these things , because they are a bit worried about to play against us . &quot;
six weeks ago she probably didn &apos;t think of us as it was the Big Games .
Bell@@ amy pointed out that the game of Storm against Roo@@ sters obtained a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against co@@ w@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I have not seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two other attempts at our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are l@@ acked and there are no points of excitement ?
for me it is the schedules .
&quot; if they mention us , it means we will be able to meet them in a phase . &quot;
the Storm Team has released this weekend because they have the right to receive either North Queensland co@@ w@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night at the A@@ AM@@ I Park next Saturday morning . ticket sales begins next morning .
Ser@@ bi@@ er with 200,000 entry on drugs to drug use
&quot; a man who may possibly face a lifetime of punishment , due to his experiment , into the possession of 40 kilograms co@@ ca@@ ine , who had been mu@@ til@@ ated to Queensland , was released against a deposit of 200,000 $ . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the Federal Police found 100 kg of the drug at the Yacht Sol@@ ay that came from South America via Van@@ u@@ at@@ u and moved in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was observed how he met his fellow @-@ def@@ endants in the marina in the afternoon and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era road@@ house where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota echo .
&quot; despite a potentially li@@ felong sentence for trying to possess a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , argued the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic , that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the Café from an inno@@ cu@@ ous reason might have been . &quot;
&quot; judge at the Supreme Court of Justice , Peter Stro@@ agan , was worried about the danger of sickness at Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the pen@@ di@@ ff , he is concerned the police about his place of residence . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic@@ s mother and step@@ father had a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security together in order to achieve its release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ id@@ av@@ ant explanations of the two persons , it is clear that the edition of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said judge Stro@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from releasing it , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ mo@@ vic was released against b@@ ail , under the conditions that he releases his Australian and his Serbian passport , hiding at the police every day , and stood at a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;

St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g used telephone of girls to attract pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le to send pictures
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
&quot; St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ g@@ g took the phone of the girl , as this slept , log@@ istic into an online mess@@ aging service , from which he received a number of un@@ decent images sent by children who were sent to him by another user . &quot;
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hands of the sle@@ ep@@ y Ho@@ g@@ g .
she saw it through him found the confusing messages and aler@@ ted immediately her mother .
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed the computer that were found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; Web research on the search for un@@ decent pictures of children . &quot;
Ho@@ g@@ g then claimed against the officers that he would have done it as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophi@@ le over the internet &quot; and he pre@@ tend to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to sc@@ are her .
&quot; E@@ ili@@ tin E@@ ili@@ ie Rober@@ t@@ son told the Dun@@ de@@ e Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be a addiction , - that he is addic@@ tive to people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the search on the computer was carried out by him , but said , unless he wanted to be a poli@@ cem@@ an to be a poli@@ cem@@ an . &quot;
after his conversations he was asked with the un@@ familiar person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said that he did it to enti@@ ce them .
&quot; he said that he is sick in the head , when he had drinks , and said , he wants to see images of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ t@@ son added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was at the tre@@ mb@@ ling and in the crying . &quot;
then she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and made the def@@ endants with him .
&quot; the girl was interviewed and said , that the accused computer and Play@@ station used to speak with girls who saw a lot of younger than he did . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ de@@ e , stated guilty to the indictment un@@ seen pictures of children on June 14 last year , to have rejected the appeal on 25 January of this year and not to mention the court appearance on March 24 of this year . &quot;
&quot; def@@ ender Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ g@@ g appears not in the register of sexual punishment , as one could argue that &quot; &quot; there is no considerable sexual element &quot; &quot; in his understanding . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Al@@ ist@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael sp@@ ill the judgment of the judgment to October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ g@@ g was granted b@@ ail in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on the other . &quot;

glut@@ user soft to small border crossing to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the German @-@ Austrian border into the German @-@ Austrian border .
many tu@@ user left fear of discovery and detention of men more often in smaller borders .
&quot; on the Austrian side , he said a speaker from the Federal Police . &quot;
&quot; along the river stream , the roads and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn have been attacked in the districts of Pass@@ au and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were walking on bridges and con@@ du@@ es to the German side .
&quot; there , it is being collected from the police station in reception and passed on to the registration . &quot;
&quot; at the Munich &apos;s railway station , the Federal Police in Germany met once again a lot more refugees in comparison to the weekend of the weekend . &quot;
&quot; after 8 : 00 a.m. , about 700 people in the state capital arrived , said a narr@@ ator in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after re @-@ establishment of controls at the Franco @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : part of the Tro@@ pen@@ Tower &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the South@@ west
meteor@@ ologists warn against storm @-@ cells in the southwest of a Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure below Western Europe currents at present , warm marine reserves present in the country , divided the German Weather Service ( Deutscher Wetter@@ dienst , DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous button is the sp@@ urs of the Trop@@ ic@@ ular &quot; Henry , &quot; that was drawn across the Atlantic in the last few days from the Bermuda Islands . &quot;
heavy storms and thunder@@ showers are expected especially in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , it is also still in the Black @-@ Forest until Thursday , to the sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the ground @-@ seek@@ er with Bo@@ en from 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
the sun sets up again and again on Friday .
the mass does it : every two years the auto@@ bahn at the IA@@ A show its new products .
&quot; in 2015 , it is important to notice the movement that are currently particularly well sold . &quot;
cars from the comp@@ ac@@ class are particularly in demand : around 2@@ 8,@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations amoun@@ ted to the Federal Employment office ( KBA ) only in August on this segment .
this is reflected in the IA@@ A ( public from 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; in this year , there are many new compact models between all the futur@@ istic concepts and new luxury cars . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest Premi@@ ers in the German auto industry is the Opel A@@ stra , which will stand in the dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; A@@ stra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann in the exhibition . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; so that the ec@@ umen@@ ical model is also well sold , the new A@@ stra should not become much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel represents a start below the biggest competitor VW Golf in view , which starts at 17 650 Euro . &quot;
the current A@@ stra costs EUR 16 9@@ 90 Euro .
A@@ stra has a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 horse@@ power .
&quot; the H@@ esse is other diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 b@@ hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , to which for the first time also include three @-@ cylinder petrol stations . &quot;
&quot; different from the most important competitor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel A@@ stra is just as a five @-@ five . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the comm@@ bi , which is already visible on the IA@@ A . &quot;
and what will be done next to the A@@ stra on the IA@@ A still on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its A@@ stra ri@@ vals Mé@@ gan@@ e to the race .
at the fair the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively as a @-@ fifth in a conventional and an emph@@ atically sporting GT @-@ version .
&quot; in the trade he comes at the beginning of next year , and then as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : very new in the segment is Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan &apos;s spin@@ ach wants to find its position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
the compact Infin@@ iti fits itself with its curved lines fully into the design line of the brand .
the base model will get a petrol engine with a power of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 b@@ hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno that celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1,@@ 0 @-@ liter turbine and an output of 82 kW / 111 PS . &quot;
the maximum torque is due to manufacturer rates in 170 new ton@@ gs ( Nm ) .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed it is the shelf @-@ class DS 4 that is visible on the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n back@@ ers laid hands on the front@@ part . here , the cooler model was drawn new and the changed head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , above all the Inf@@ ot@@ ain@@ ment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons is reduced by a touch screen and is using Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the IA@@ A in the comp@@ actor has added a number of mach@@ inations and new variations such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class , or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 GT@@ I . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given an ex @-@ prisoner of the judicial system of Justice , who was holding monthly periods in one to small cell . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners have generally to be entitled to financial compensation , when they are contained in small cells . &quot;
the decision has decided that the Federal Constitutional Court has elected a decision on Wednesday .
&quot; however , those affected can even hope for money if they were only a few days locked into confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 B@@ v@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an explosion prisoner with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was accommodated in a single cell g@@ ade between June and November 2009 in a single cell with approximately five square metres surface area ; the toilet was spati@@ ally separated . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who has been transported to his lawyer by now has moved into a larger cell after the information of his law . &quot;
his office cl@@ en@@ ades because of the un@@ worthy Ar@@ ms against the State of Berlin were ple@@ ted .
&quot; however , the Constitutional Court lifted the judgment of the Chamber of Berlin and transferred back the case to the renewed test . &quot;
you see human dignity of man injured .
chamber court decides now on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if legal reasons are made for compensation only a few days of Haf@@ tt@@ age for the compensation , be an equ@@ alisation of compensation , called it . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a ch@@ illing of the legal protection of the personality would be &quot; &quot; to fear . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the chamber of law must now be resolved at the level of exposure .
&quot; in the past , the imp@@ rec@@ ters have often reinforced the rights of prisoners . &quot;
&quot; thus they said only in April of an in@@ dem@@ nity discharge , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a decision from 2011 is estimated also to be the multi@@ fac@@ in@@ ction of a cell without separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; Karlsruhe also acknowledged the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ mate prisoner in a parall@@ el@@ incident in November 2009 an in@@ decent accommodation . &quot;
the then @-@ then Klä@@ ger was transferred from 15 to 21 hours each day in a similar cell than in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
the Berlin prisons were made in recent weeks as well because of missing personnel entered into the head@@ lines .
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked for 23 hours , which rises aggres@@ siveness , even to blows , it should have already been due to the tense situation . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the police @-@ police officers , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of junior leaders , 19 should rise in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we are making this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German Chancellor is determined to accept it .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seekers are to come to Germany according to progn@@ oses of the Federal Ministry of Commerce this year , according to the statement by vice chan@@ cell@@ or Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take one million refugees . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say to you again and again : we can do that and we create it . &quot;
what is coming on Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various forecasts between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ating of the Federal Ministry of Commerce ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments every year - and the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as it is built until now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing is more dramatic , but mostly in affordable housing objects : yearly from 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing due to rent , and in order to apply these especially convenient apartments also refugees . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Re@@ ference in Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore aims to double up , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; much too little is that from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing each year would have to develop , and for this , the federal government would have to invest EUR 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; agreed , scientists and federal ministries agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates of the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) , the Institute for Employment Research ( Employment Research ) is assumed that 55 percent of the Refu@@ ge@@ es in Germany can be remuner@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be asked for their qualifications in order to help them when they started , and Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann foundation . &quot;
&quot; but for the integration of refugees , it is crucial whether they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for esteem in the recording society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of migrants , he says mig@@ u@@ rolog@@ ists Diet@@ rich hei@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to Thr@@ ace , Germany has given a political shift : from the labour market for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while earlier a working ban offered for asylum seekers from up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residences to asylum seekers on a residential location . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the lack of qualified labour , the point of view has prevailed that refugees should be able to gain access to the labour market faster . &quot;
a major barrier to access the labour market is a lack of complete knowledge .
&quot; up to now , there is not yet a complete offer in general and vocation @-@ related language courses . &quot;
studies also indicate that jobs are most commonly conve@@ yed by personal contacts .
the development of networks is therefore based on Thr@@ es@@ hardt on the Königs@@ weg for working integration .
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few fl@@ atten@@ ed parents give their children to the kids , estimated at ten to 15 percent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oting of parents , it is only once quite important to hold the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ schem@@ atic , spokes@@ man for youth and family at the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , spread the administration of manual in different languages . &quot;
&quot; should the need for educ@@ ators strongly increase through the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - by doing more specialized schools . &quot;
in the countries students with no Spanish knowledge of welcome classes are prepared for the classroom .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers and teachers , but also like in Berlin , also by teachers who have only one qualification in English as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ay of the Berlin school administration . &quot;
the German Student@@ en@@ werk appreci@@ ates that about 20 percent of refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal law receives asylum seekers or commemor@@ ated the study - the only exception was so far Berlin , inside Frank Hen@@ kel ( CD@@ U ) has abandoned its position but now . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the access to the university could be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; because refugees with a bur@@ ial or d@@ ul@@ ing do not receive achievements after the asylum @-@ rights law , when they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; the latter actually does not receive a BA@@ Fö@@ G , as it does not fall under the groups of the B@@ af@@ ö@@ g@@ eligible people . &quot;
accepted refugees had to have lived for four years in Germany to be entitled to BA@@ Fö@@ G . to shor@@ tens the number of BA@@ Fö@@ G allowed to shor@@ tens these rati@@ os for 15 months .
&quot; however , this funding gap must also be closed if Steff@@ en Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Junior Minister for Science , and the German Student@@ en@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get to BA@@ Fö@@ G .
&quot; in future , Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
the state should uph@@ old the same rights to Islam as they have the churches and develop the existing state @-@ churches law to a new state of religions .
&quot; however , the establishment of an Islamic welfare association is very important for the new arrivals . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam must agree to clear contact persons and be willing to work together with the state in many fields and to give him certain control opportunities . &quot;
&quot; it also includes a readiness to act against religious fundament@@ alism , too . &quot;
&quot; the Chairman of the central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ e@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday , religious conflicts could also be entered into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany wanted , &quot; immediately have their right to be here at times , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ rische Rund@@ funk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law to Arab .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more today than a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; with this , the majority society will have to change , the elimination of discrimination and racism will be more pressing . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a anti @-@ discrimination situation and a General Equality Act . &quot;
&quot; but it sounds very slow , as the NS@@ U @-@ M@@ ord@@ serie showed , in which police and authorities did not ignore the rac@@ ist motif . &quot;
&quot; equal chances for all : what migr@@ ating organizations and stakeholders in non @-@ white German have already been calling for a long time and to become the international agreement as the anti @-@ rac@@ ist League , to become a reality in the coming years if the country is peace@@ fully and its new citizens should use its possibilities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany was able to medi@@ ate medi@@ cally by the previously expected refugees , the Spanish President Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for Man@@ or Power and capacities , we create it , &quot; he said the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , it also has to add extra money into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is required to cover all com@@ ers in the registration of health species . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , services could be re@@ funded with the Bundes@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly questionable , so many people agree with the limited performance catalogue covering the law of asylum . &quot;
otherwise make the doctors first to create language barriers .
&quot; already so far , the Berlin scientific scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are more inferior to their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in hospitals , also in medical offices , interpre@@ ters would have to be taken over , she calls for it . &quot;
&quot; however , a lot of refugees would have helped many refugees with even more general medical records in the emergency field . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugees , approximately there are much more untreated abilities , and in the young people it is about HIV @-@ En@@ ligh@@ tenment . &quot;
&quot; with some of the sometimes path@@ ologies , German doctors came from their education but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery is . &quot;
&quot; parasi@@ tism or tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ osis are not so difficult to recognize . and , as regards the aff@@ lu@@ ence , be even reli@@ eving by the refugees even reli@@ eving . &quot;
the Syrians had a high @-@ developed educational system ; several refugees even are doctors .
&quot; in order to practice it , however , they should disc@@ ard their qualifications and disc@@ ard tests . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arrive in Germany ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) is still sick . most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; vulnerable , Refu@@ ge@@ os@@ in@@ der , explains Diet@@ rich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by TU München demonstrates that every five Syrian refugee boat is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , suffers because of things in so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with breathing difficulty , verti@@ go , heart speed and de@@ ath@@ est . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleeping and concentration disorders , strong ti@@ ghtening and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent that the symptoms would be chronic , be an early treatment necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; however , only four percent of psych@@ ologically sick refugees get a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although , psych@@ ically sick @-@ seekers can take an application for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , however , it usually takes several months to work . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the SR@@ s , most often im@@ migrant workers or doctors , who are not trained for the psych@@ ic diseases , decide whether a therapy is required or not . &quot;
&quot; this often lead to mal@@ ign@@ ments , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
with the new staging of &quot; passion &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of cir@@ cus art .
&quot; the goal is to attract any age group in the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and its beauty . &quot;
now the cir@@ cus also invites to live in the Man@@ ege on the brick of the was@@ en to dream .
&quot; our passion is the cir@@ cus . &quot;
&quot; I cannot imagine , without living my cir@@ cus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ cher and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this slogan is the current manager of the manager . &quot;
for more than 33 years the cir@@ cus is in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst .
the gift to enth@@ use the family is thus in the blood .
&quot; it is important to us to get away people from their everyday life and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; says the 27 @-@ year @-@ old j@@ uni@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ ously with world city flair , &quot; thus says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst looks his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3 000 kilometres long tour can experience this flair .
the program of Circus convinced with talented artists from around the world .
awarded at the international cir@@ cus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v Clo@@ wn Family attract the audience with wit and charm in her spell . &quot;
even the Castillo Brothers understand their craft .
with the heroes of the films it wants to take the Cub@@ an duo .
eas@@ iness and mobility - with these words they identify themselves .
their hum@@ orous art in the mast is to conquer women &apos;s her@@ zen in the storm .
except through numerous salmon sal@@ ts the ac@@ rob@@ atics of Circus Pro@@ bst looks also with finger@@ tips and joints .
with the bike on a ball @-@ balance ?
for He Yuan no problem .
slim people fascin@@ ate and fri@@ ghten up the same time .
Wang L@@ in from China is with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics to become familiar with the most ancient form of ac@@ rob@@ atics .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies mother , Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
abnorm@@ alities in the attitudes of Circus are only too often subject of animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes position : &quot; &quot; do not go well to our animals , it also does not go well . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each mat@@ ing unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ legged Arti@@ sts &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , is read by the eyes of each request from the eyes . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
does the animal does not feel at ease , it doesn &apos;t want it into the ring . &quot;
the first commandment is : good for the animals to care .
&quot; specially to her z@@ eb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land Pon@@ y@@ h@@ eng@@ st and a z@@ eb@@ ra @-@ mare , the family is very proud . &quot;
the two animals spent eight years together in a pen and nothing is happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our small jum@@ bo was there , &quot; says Brig@@ itte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the z@@ eb@@ roid is not yet ready for the Man@@ ege , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
so for every visitor something should be part of it .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or more 200 viewers , we always give our best and are with all my heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites 17 to 20 September every day at 17 and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 17 o &apos;clock , the prices are discounted . &quot;
furthermore it is open every day from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m .
Sim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , African oldest guides , dropped by a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; at last , he finally remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case quickly spread about social media . &quot;
&quot; the opening of the parliament was also comfor@@ ted by alleg@@ ations of members of the opposition , that they had obtained anonymous death @-@ threats and warned that they were warned of speaking the address by Mr Mu@@ gabe with Bu@@ hr@@ ined . &quot;
last month she had booked him and interrupted him during his speech to the State of the State in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
&quot; the spokes@@ man for democratic change ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said , that seven Op@@ tical politician SMS messages have received on their mobile phones , which they warned of Mr. Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , &quot; he said journalist to Mu@@ gabe . &quot;
&quot; she warns the affected Parliament members that will end the immunity in parliament , and as soon as they left the parliament , their parliamentary immunity are no longer effective . &quot;
the leader said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; worried about the dangers for politicians .
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is going to build up to 30.000 jobs
He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to launch approximately 25,000 to 30.000 jobs within the restructuring of restructuring and saving efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split up later this year into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and its service activities .
the expected job super@@ structure leads to a load of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP told in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; this restructuring measures will enable a more effective , more sustainable cost @-@ structure for the new He@@ w@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chair and Chief Executive , who will lead the unity to separation . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise is focused less and stronger than HP today , and we have a broad portfolio of stores which support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the needs of our customers around the world . &quot;
&quot; He@@ w@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than 50 billion annual revenues and &quot; will be focused on providing up to date , integrated technology solutions to companies &quot; thus ensuring an explanation of the company . &quot;
&quot; it shares a company that was founded in the 19@@ 30s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill He@@ w@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard , who created electro @-@ plants and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage was the birthplace of the Silicon Valley . &quot;
HP has passed a massive restructuring to tackle the move from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; the measure of HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC @-@ vendor and one of the largest US @-@ tech companies , is the latest in this area based on the belief that focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC arsen@@ al @-@ captain Mi@@ ck@@ art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates before the play against the Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to be behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger pointed out to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation is following plan , there is no reason why he cannot play before Christmas again . &quot;
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly be missed at least the next four games for England and in view of its history , its participation in the next summer will certainly still be uncertain . &quot;
&quot; the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere ended the last season after a separate dum@@ pl@@ aster , and then returned to his old swing back during the season . &quot;
&quot; this kind of violation is not threatening the career , &quot; &quot; said . &quot;
&quot; it is a bone , which is not well @-@ healed . &quot;
it is not a major issue .
this was only an accident .
it was not in touch with his ank@@ le or with the wounds that he had previously .
&quot; this may be true from a medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the per@@ tin@@ ent danger of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an uncomfortable pattern .
the study of Prime Minister In@@ j@@ uries Ltd . 23 different disorders of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 Lig@@ asp@@ ires in the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture for arsen@@ al is that it has been in six of eight game times since 2007 / 08 , one of the two Premier League &apos;s clubs that most vulner@@ ability have reported . &quot;
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but Arsenal believes that an improvement in vulner@@ ability rate during the last season will last . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , if you return from an injury , you have a more suscep@@ tible period of time when you have to strengthen your body and gain momentum , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
arsen@@ al won his Champions League event on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ track on the next Wednesday and Wen@@ ger presents itself as a rotation within the team .
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey does not have travelled to Croatia , which means Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ ro@@ ud instead of Re@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cott .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and give the players it need to give a small break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said little . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favour@@ ites are to come by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb belongs to the playing fields with the greatest intru@@ sion effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o has also been un@@ defeated after 41 Games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign was launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , while at the Richter scale 3.@@ 2 were measured . &quot;
this year it was the 10th place in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger is the opinion that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from the past season with the Champions League sub@@ jug@@ ation against Monaco , and is still far away from distant hopes , with his management the association to lead his first European ap@@ ocal@@ al triumph . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in ar@@ mo@@ ury .
&quot; we were very close in 2006 , but on the other hand I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not a dre@@ amer . &quot;
friendly ceremony : the Com@@ edy Show which gave us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , particularly with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more distr@@ acted than ever before , such as icide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year high @-@ prove . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important death cause in men aged between 20 and 45 in the UK , and it stays for three times more often in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Camp@@ a@@ ign Ag@@ ainst Living Mis@@ er@@ ase ( CA@@ LM - campaign against a pi@@ tiful life ) 2015 were the year of the man to ask the culture to seek help if they need it . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study with more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms proved that when the pas@@ sions had a sufficient high percentage of friends with a healthy mood , his chances of recovery itself doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , hal@@ ved a circle of mental healthy friends the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you just have to have friends for a friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of more social media @-@ guided communication , with its focus on the substance on substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a more important contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have the need to appear strong , life @-@ fun and successful , doubles , even if in reality the isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologist is ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affect our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can &apos;t really buy happiness . &quot;
the Beautiful in Friends was that this focuss@@ ing on the head was placed .
&quot; every character was not defined by his work , but his personality ded by his interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humor of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments when football are spent in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the nostal@@ gia of Ross for Rachel - all this came from knowing that men can always refer to it , even if they often refrain from exploring their feelings . &quot;
&quot; how an employee of the phone support they explained to me : ... &quot; my listening role for people who are de@@ pressed and self @-@ prescribed , has shown me really clearly how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often don &apos;t feel able to talk with friends .
&quot; I cope with the old phrase &quot; &quot; I com@@ m with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if one speaks openly about the problems . &quot;
&quot; Friends is one of the shows that come to me in my mind , when I try to offer long @-@ term payment mechanisms . &quot;
it clearly presents the small moments of men &apos;s friend@@ ships .
so very my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status on the phone the person in eye @-@ eye of despair also may help out the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit this weekend com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ feast with the celebration of celebration of the day fully re@@ arranged scenery , why do not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better , if you see someone alone in Star@@ bucks , please give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship may make .
friends will be broadcast at Com@@ edy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
meets Maria to help PS@@ G to help Malmö to crus@@ hing Malmö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and he &apos;s son Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malmö .
&quot; di Maria meets his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass by in Malmö . &quot;
here is the review and the reaction to the game .
&quot; angel Di Maria and H@@ son Cav@@ ani reported on the course of Paris Saint @-@ Germain his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malmö in the print book on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; it took less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League for the PS@@ G players who brought the French master to the way , but afterwards she missed a number of opportunities before she finally scored a head@@ ache when Cav@@ ani in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ ez@@ k also in group A needed Paris a strong start against the Swedish Masters , as they seek not only the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter @-@ finals in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no clear picture of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic@@ s missed odds in front of the gate . he later started in the game against his hometown , and against the club , with which he started his illustr@@ ative career already in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or down@@ ward in the Champions League . therefore , it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents and look relaxed , even though there are certain things that we have yet to perf@@ ecting it over the season , &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good sign . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have scored one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic returned after his injury in one of three changes in the Paris team , which could hold on the weekend a 2 : 2 inv@@ oked at their own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but was also shown in the fourth minute by Di Maria . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian show storms was described as the man , the PS@@ G was taken to the next stage in Europe , and he pointed out why , when he ran at Marco Ver@@ rat@@ tis Pass behind the Malmö defence , before he graduated from Johan Wil@@ and passing pretty into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if anyone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malmö , the Celtic in a Play @-@ off proposed to reach that level , joined at An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players on the field and was a he@@ avier opponent with a five @-@ man defense and two more deeply in the mid@@ field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nik@@ ola D@@ jur@@ dj@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tr@@ apps P@@ fo@@ sten in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G gave himself sometimes on , with some lack of mis@@ ses and bad inclu@@ sions , not least from Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic but was abandoned with no less than five attempts only in the first half of them and then after Cav@@ ani restored it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he pointed much more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players to the game , and it was a pass of Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic , turned into a turning into that of Wil@@ at in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hours of mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ ans had thus reached its sixth season , after Ibra@@ hi@@ mo@@ vic had a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all thoughts that Malmö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention of Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could hold the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi has been able to detect a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the trainer from Malmö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , gave later that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said , &quot; &quot; our last Champions League game was last year last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which did not have the same level .
the qualification games are not sufficient . &quot;
hut in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !

Matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film
Matt Dam@@ on made the af@@ ro@@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during discussion of the variety and said she will not be needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a sequence of Sunday Night from HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light under@@ cut the experienced actor Brown , as the need to emphas@@ ise the need for alternative perspectives in relation to a black prot@@ agon@@ ists in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; when we talk about diversity , then do it during filling the film and not in the cast of the show , &quot; assured Dam@@ on . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , with in@@ dig@@ al un@@ belief and called &quot; hoo ! wow . okay , &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian himself . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown were joining the Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show @-@ fin@@ alists .
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will always be the director - as they treat the figure of Harmony , &quot; Brown first told . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a wh@@ ore , be@@ aten up by her white sugar . &quot;
&quot; the producer of De@@ ar White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kr@@ isten Bran@@ c@@ accio for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something what we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion has been broadcast , the social media was explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger on the clip that he wrote &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO KNO@@ WING that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et served more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its publication . &quot;
Dam@@ on comments arrive at a time when accurate rac@@ representation in the media is at the top of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed in 2014 by a white police officers , the movement recorded Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter throughout the country and urged legis@@ lat@@ ure and authorities to command discrimin@@ atory practices against color@@ ations . &quot;
in February the singer Prince began a play@@ through on the motion during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; albums silent &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black lives , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation and in response to the question of the Fox @-@ News @-@ personality Elisabeth Ha@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the guides . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ees , producers and media art , who invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;

&apos; American Ninja Warri@@ or &apos;s First Champion
&quot; professional clim@@ bers and user@@ es Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero was the first athle@@ te , who won the American Ninja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; the competition show that completed just their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participants that complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season &apos;s final , there are two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman &apos;s Ge@@ off B@@ ritten , until the finals . &quot;
its last task was the climbing time of a 75 foot long Cli@@ pping rope in 30 seconds .
&quot; B@@ ritten ended the task within the time , which he finished the first athle@@ te , who completed the stren@@ uous stage 4 of American Ninja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero ended these challenges in three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke with emails ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock on winning the Great Prize of 1 million $ . &quot;
&quot; I mean , it is amazing to think about it , I have never earned over 10,000 $ or about life , &quot; Isaac E ! about his whole bunch of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood re@@ porter to discuss the finals , and why B@@ ritten , although he was first at all the course , did not get any prize money . &quot;
after the rules the money goes to the fastest person .
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alists , it gets the one with the quick@@ est time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and changed life , he gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t believe , that he has had it a res@@ entment . &quot;
he is just so fortunate to have done what he did .
masses of distinc@@ tions he received from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad it Isaac is Isaac . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac was just in the same way , if they had exchanged the re@@ els . &quot;
&quot; America Ninja Warri@@ or was extended for a bunch of season , the shooting will start in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minnesota T@@ wins
the MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not very fun for the Detroit tiger .
&quot; sooner or later , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers stand on the last place in the American league Central . &quot;
&quot; the tigers are reduced to their role as Spo@@ iler , played this part however on Tuesday perfectly against the Minnesota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot;
the twins wasted a chance to climb within a game of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League of Wild@@ Card .
&quot; for Detroit , if only for one night , it was a return to the three letter F term that was so difficult to lay out over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers manager Brad P@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Alfredo Simon retained his early offensive support , when Detroit had scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) proposed 6 times in the 1 / 3 Inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it has only been his third successful start in his last nine matches .
&quot; I will end this year strongly , &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to throw in the bull@@ dog each game , and so I really want to go down in the game . &quot;
&quot; the nom@@ inee @-@ designed Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hit and was in two runs , his first R@@ B@@ Is since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three @-@ hit record of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle naval forces on July 6 . &quot;
&quot; he has well stri@@ pped the p@@ ony , &quot; said pronoun@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at her ( drummer training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ dog , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the h@@ ind at the end of the seventh day , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back into the game . &quot;
center Fiel@@ ds B@@ yron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
&quot; Right Fiel@@ ds of Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a stronghold , and Simon gave his second bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ cian for the Stri@@ ke@@ out , before it was replaced with the lef@@ ty Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran the wall , the only man he faced with whom he was faced , before the nom@@ en@@ ched R@@ ook@@ ie Tro@@ u Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ys the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ ges a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
with a pair of runners and their finishing in the second Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ les brought to a double play .
&quot; it was that in the Major League &apos;s leading 27th , this season that pl@@ ou@@ ghs struck a double play . &quot;
&quot; after Detroit finished an Insurance @-@ Run on the end of the ninth @-@ down , the wall made a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and recorded the booth of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
the right @-@ handed stab@@ bed S@@ ano at three Pit@@ ches for its fifth save .
Detroit benefited from the start of the game from a still un@@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three ra@@ ids in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed @-@ veter@@ an , who had been painted before the game by the vulner@@ ability list after having been missing more than a month because of a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I had wished for me , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I get started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches out in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after she received the Le@@ ad@@ off @-@ Bat@@ ter in the first day , Hus@@ aster gave a single to second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play with a single &quot; up the middle &quot; run at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z managed his 0 @-@ 21 success series with the Run@@ es in the Scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ ner Nick Castell@@ anos was followed by a single on the right , managed a further run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game as he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers applied to the second , achieved a one @-@ out double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a two @-@ out single from Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds at the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; it was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ Manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he has not taken well , but he has caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was located in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the Sc@@ hen@@ ger@@ men &apos;s relief . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , it came to three cycles of six hits and one walk with four stri@@ ke@@ outs . &quot;
notes : tiger R@@ HP Ani@@ al San@@ chez was divided because of a violation of the throw @-@ holder .
&quot; he is investigated by Dr. James Andre@@ ws , who operated the shoulder of San@@ chez in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; San@@ chez , since mid @-@ August on viol@@ t@@ tion list , is scheduled to be activated for the launch on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ chez from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Morris from the vulner@@ ability will be rep@@ ain@@ ted to launch the twins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he had been missing for the 20th August because of a frac@@ tional in the right hip ist .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the target Field on Wednesday .
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) is being played against min@@ str@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) . &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be signed in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the righteous people there then are to accomo@@ date in Wiesbaden in Wiesbaden , like the City of Wiesbaden in the evening evening . &quot;
it will be reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees may be temporary .
they are then to be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days , the President of the interim President G@@ ießen 7@@ 500 people had arrived in H@@ esse . &quot;
also Frankfurt and Han@@ au have established emergency accommodations in sport halls due to the great number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria
&quot; the head of Munich &apos;s Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German participation in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I believe the decisive re@@ thinking about military options must not take place without Germany , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he threw the European states &quot; collective &quot; over .
&quot; four years ago , he was glad that the cup of military participation in Germany has passed . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict rests in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutsch@@ land@@ funk . &quot;
the former German Ambassador in Washington also called for a massive boost to international assistance on site for the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria once again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; the Austrian Minister of Johanna Mich@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner told the evening in the Austrian TV station OR@@ F , to Hungary no one will be sent back now . &quot;
but Germany did not return refugees to Austria .
&quot; no , that is so agreed &quot; &quot; she declared . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of an agreement to include a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said , I have already announced any relevant discussions between the General Director for Public Health and representatives from Germany . &quot;
concrete numbers cited them not and dis@@ missed on Wednesday in Berlin .
in the last days tens of thousands of refugees came from Hungary via the so @-@ called Baltic Sea from Hungary to Austria .
your goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann filed a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had begun on Sunday with temporary border controls .
the EU has not yet to agree on a common approach to the crisis .
&quot; the EU &apos;s interior ministers want to take on Tuesday ( 22 September ) at a special meeting for the binding distribution of more 120 000 refugees . &quot;
&quot; given the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries in the initial intake and distribution of men . &quot;
&quot; the agreement will be held in cooperation with the countries , Angela Merkel in the late evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the chan@@ cell@@ or in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel over@@ board , those people who fight protection , would like this too . &quot;
but who has no lead perspective cannot be left in Germany too .
this idea was expressed in the round of press .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole now has to cope with an &quot; huge power supply . &quot;
thousands of distr@@ au@@ ght refugees now stuck on the Baltic Sea route .
Hungary made its 175 kilometres long border to Serbia in the night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced that the border reached Romania with a fence . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this neighbourhood is different from Serbia to the EU . &quot;
&quot; Hungary wanted to avoid evil transi@@ tions from Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ ar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government condemned the Plan immediately .
there were first de@@ ten@@ tions of people who had passed through the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , the e@@ ye@@ witness report@@ edly made thousands of migrants on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
spac@@ ecraft &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; finds the ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the E@@ isp@@ an@@ zer of Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us vibr@@ ates a global ocean .
&quot; this includes researchers from observations of the space &quot; &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon cras@@ hes easily on its orbit around the ring . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small , but still too big for a consistent Cel@@ estial body , it is in communication of the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US @-@ state New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers show their analyses in the &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; sheet .
even longer it was known that under the Eis@@ decke of En@@ cel@@ e have to give fluid water .
&quot; thus , &quot; C@@ ass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered iron vul@@ can@@ es on the south @-@ pole of Satur@@ n@@ mon@@ ds , the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus to feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
at least at the south @-@ pole it had to be an underestimated sea by the astronom@@ ers then .
&quot; however , the extension of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
Rama missing several weeks in Munich in 18@@ 60
the 18@@ 60 Munich must ren@@ oun@@ ce around one month to the abandoned Val@@ det Rama .
a study carried out an Ad@@ duc@@ tor breach of the 27 @-@ year @-@ old that the association shared .
Rama had already stolen a pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich , the diagnosis is expected to have four weeks of compul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; this is difficult for us , Rama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think now , &quot; said Sport Director Nec@@ kar@@ n &apos;s &quot; &quot; image &quot; &quot; newspaper with a view to the possible commitment of a unified professionals . &quot;

no diet @-@ fruit - man@@ goes contains a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
those who want to pay attention to their slender line will often fall off from them more often .
because man@@ goes contains relatively much sugar - especially Sac@@ char@@ ose .
&quot; nevertheless the exotic fruits are nevertheless : in their put B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. Be@@ en all included man@@ goes , but much vitamin A and its pre@@ amplifier beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; who e@@ ats the fruits , supports the gravity , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when you buy , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant . &quot;
&quot; the nuts alone does not say anything about how ripe the fruit is , so you can taste the green man@@ gos very tasty . &quot;
&quot; they should be kept at room temperature , and within a few days it should be consumed . &quot;
then they taste pure pure or sweet foods .

on Wednesday and on the night of Thursday the F@@ öh@@ n is partly blowing up with the super@@ natural valleys .
&quot; on Thursday morning , on Thursday morning we will cross a striking water@@ front , the vigor@@ ous rain falls , wind arches , and a temperature clo@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; as Mete@@ o@@ News notice , Switzerland is currently on the front side of an extensive low @-@ pressure @-@ area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest . &quot;
on the alpine north side breaks down the night to the Wednesday of the hair dryer through the valleys .
&quot; in the episode the F@@ öh@@ n until Thursday morning in the bas@@ eline , with Bö@@ s of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land , partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the chin @-@ gro@@ ove may end up to the adjacent middle of the Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even Or@@ can bro@@ c@@ ites are possible of over 120 km / h . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday , mix@@ ers for summer temperatures rises from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity is beginning to set up in the alp@@ ens@@ er . &quot;
here rains swe@@ pt up until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum of the Alps in the next 48 hours , some over 100 lit@@ res of rain must be calculated per square meter , depending on the last days there are large amounts of rain . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow goes out , as a result rolls a cold front with a strong , partly ge@@ aring rain from west to east through Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold @-@ front , the wind is sharp and storms , and the temperatures go clearly back . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , however , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther @-@ Square
just 500 years after the Reformation in Rome there is now a Martin @-@ Lu@@ ther square .
&quot; in the presence of Ign@@ a@@ zio Marino , on Wednesday an official place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was bapti@@ sed to the name of the German reform@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now known as &quot; &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of Reformation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the park lies in the middle of the old Rome right next to the Col@@ os@@ seum .
the naming was requested by the work @-@ community of the protest@@ ant churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Luther@@ an Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es could live beyond the centuries as minority often only in conce@@ aled their faith . &quot;
&quot; with the place I become visible in a symbolic way , that their tradition of Christian faith in Rome is welcome . &quot;
Martin Lu@@ ther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k around the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he received the city back then as a sin .
his negative impressions are likely to lead him to historians in his later fight against Rome .

hammer artist invested three years into the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( g@@ ild@@ ed ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Oth@@ mar Alt described in his Bible .
Klaus All@@ te@@ post has written the introduction and updated the Bible .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with gorgeous images . &quot;
in the beginning the picture was for Ot@@ mar Alt who formulated his very personal interpre@@ tations of biblical stories on paper and canvas .
his &quot; language &quot; with colorful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old - which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective subjects , this can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; approximately three years Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his bi@@ ble project , for which he made a subjective artistic selection from the many thematic areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which devote themselves to themes such as cru@@ ising , pl@@ agues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land . &quot;
&quot; thus he was fascinated by spontaneously into several partners : this applies to the Lu@@ ther publisher with his the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler @-@ Verlag with his main focus on art books . &quot;
and since then is the author of Klaus Al@@ te@@ post referring to the basis of painting using the homepage of the Bible .
&quot; he has interpreted the Bible from the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible , thus translated into current contexts . &quot;
these texts are written as verbal mirror of algae painting .
&quot; embedded between the original Bible study by Martin Lu@@ ther , and one of the artist , who was formulated his quite personal thoughts here . &quot;
the jewelry tape has Golden Let@@ ters .
the 75 @-@ year @-@ old just allows a profound insight into his soul - his emotions .
this is a high level of intimacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately all the trigger for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , 1940 in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruling party . &quot;
&quot; then the education happened already with the pipeline , &quot; reminds himself &quot; Ot@@ mar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I have tried to impose this , in order to be able to forgive me again with the Lord Father again . &quot;
&quot; his second concern is that art in quicker times is to be more important . &quot; &quot; the perception of ima@@ gery has now been shaped by complaints , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is eliminated now .
artists have a different desire and glad@@ ness to show things .
pictures still have a mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wishes to let the viewer come into the images , &quot; let them discover , discover and feel the strength they have : &quot; the picture is looking for his counterpart . &quot;
Klaus Al@@ te@@ post brought on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Foundation which has always been &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts Art : &quot; I like him that he understands with his images .
&quot; he did not take care of seeing the Bible fully , but those that are important for him also , also mysterious issues . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Al@@ te@@ post : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text describes only . &quot; &quot; be a photo @-@ Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans Mö@@ h@@ ler from Lu@@ ther publisher this work is an invitation , to deepen his life and find freedom . &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts paintings speak for se@@ ag@@ ys both the ( biblical ) language of love and responsibility .
a part of the origin@@ als - paper and linen we@@ aves - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition that will be opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction for BM@@ X @-@ railway
&quot; made plans , place found , company charged , ground @-@ ke@@ epers mod@@ eled for a circuit : one year later it was almost all finished - yet even before the official opening of the BM@@ X rail was already the end again . &quot;
&quot; om@@ is@@ sions in politics and administration , especially among the residents , who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus hills de@@ ported , new place were sought - now with a formal planning and application on building permit . &quot;
&quot; the permission will enter October in October , with the first com@@ mon@@ er Sabine Mo@@ se@@ bach @-@ Bo@@ ck now in the children &apos;s youth and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope that this year is still visible , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
it should then be started without &quot; further mem@@ orials &quot; with the works of the former indoor pool .
DF@@ B strengthened commitment to refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B expands its commitment to refugees to 2019 , the Bundesliga also put a clear sign in the weekend . &quot;
&quot; the football will react to the conservation situation in Germany , enabling the policy to help politicians to cope with the upcoming problems . &quot;
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t matter me anything , I have nothing to do with that . &quot;
&quot; this must include every single interest to get this issue under control , &quot; said DF@@ B leader Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
in the annual meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany .
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the chan@@ cell@@ or and meet the state Minister of State , W@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; then the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; &quot; he announced . &quot;
the football could and wool .
but the decisive step must take politics .
the German soccer league will therefore have expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; for four years .
&quot; during the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Foundation , we ensured that this program continues up to 2019 , &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach , at the border of the UEF@@ A conference in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some Federal lists support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 Pro@@ fi@@ ver@@ a put a clear sign when on the left tri@@ cot instead of the usual sponsor for sponsor@@ ing ( Her@@ mes ) , we will help raise the imprint &quot; We will help &quot; - # tract . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can only , &quot; &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ sman Ru@@ di Fi@@ ler of the &quot; &quot; Image &quot; &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ natur@@ al@@ ness &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee @-@ drama goes everybody , no one can be seen . &quot;
&quot; we can make soccer player , no , we must use our radi@@ ance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees who have already suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ si@@ ms Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig talked about a &quot; prominent symbols of the league . &quot;
&quot; to the European Championship Quali@@ fications against Hungary at this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach describes the support of refugees as a &quot; great Community &quot; of German football .
&quot; that all 36 roy@@ alties have launched in their places , be great . &quot;
&quot; as great as it is , that small and smallest clubs are active . &quot;
&quot; the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; that we have spent , will be living in football . &quot;
&quot; it is of enormous significance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; this year , together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government , the Association provides 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the associations have also called up the whole sum of 2015 as well , &quot; reported Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP @-@ Board of talks loses an eye in case of an accident
&quot; the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software group , Bill M@@ der@@ mot@@ t , has report@@ edly lost the left eye with several reports by fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the crash on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA he was fallen at midnight on a water @-@ glass which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; economic week &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is nearly ble@@ ed , was impot@@ ent , then he then cras@@ hed out to the road - that he told us so last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ ki &quot; SAP @-@ co @-@ founder H@@ ass@@ plat@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could leave his job .
&quot; in early October we meet before the supervisory board at Wall@@ dorf , &quot; said salmon . &quot;
54 years old manager was in the process of organising and &quot; fully functioning . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday , on Thursday ) , he will come back to Germany in October and lead the software group further . &quot;
&quot; I am full of SAP there , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course I stood in regular contact with the Super@@ - and his chairman H@@ asso salmon , &quot; &quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t said the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t is usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German head office in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; if it is important to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; &quot; everyone can happen . &quot;
&quot; important is to stand up again , if one is fallen . &quot;
Mc@@ L@@ aren - spare pilot pilot except Po@@ fe@@ cht ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen we@@ ather@@ ed a corresponding photo and explained that he suffered an injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as a reservation in Singapore on weekends as well as a reservation for the two ordinary , Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and Jen@@ son button , like a week later at the Great Prize of Japan . &quot;
football : BV@@ B without Re@@ us against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : past@@ ors in the gate
&quot; at Bor@@ us@@ sia Dortmund , all the hopes came to a com@@ eback of Marco Re@@ us in the first group play in the European league . &quot;
the national player is missing the soccer team as well as the Bundesliga as well as in the du@@ el with the FK Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7.@@ 00 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; we can not rely on him &quot; , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ck@@ les on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether Re@@ us on Sunday in Bundesliga team against Le@@ verk@@ usen will be back again , the BV@@ B @-@ Coach would be open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its tribal , based on the Re@@ us position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ keeper .
that is why Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of Roman Roman E@@ ki .
&quot; he trained on an absolute top level , &quot; praised the soccer teacher for the world champion . &quot;
&quot; but whether iron f@@ eller in the future comes to use in all of Europe &apos;s league games , however , Tu@@ ck@@ les left us open . &quot;
with high probability he will also be the second section .
the for@@ ba@@ al statement of co @-@ players Re@@ us that the Fin@@ ally withdrawal for the BV@@ B in the Europa League has to be the target &quot; holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian W@@ eig@@ l for tr@@ ack@@ able : &quot; thus Marco is not so wrong .
I think we have a good chance to pick the title .
Robot@@ er@@ au@@ tos : government wants to play a role for Germany
Germany should be fron@@ trun@@ ner under the will of the German government in the change of cars technology .
&quot; the Bundes@@ kab@@ in@@ et decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Verkehrs@@ Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which includes investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke on Wednesday in Frankfurt at the edge of the &quot; &quot; Autom@@ acy IA@@ A &quot; &quot; of a new mobile age . &quot;
&quot; automated , inter@@ connected cycling will increase traffic safety and ensure less pit , said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he wants to discuss the issue with his counterpart from the G@@ 7 nations , who will come together with representatives of the industry on the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the company &apos;s strategy paper focuses on the importance of mobile broad@@ band style and a rapid decline on digital radio . &quot;
the testing of new technology is currently developing a test road on highway 9 in Bavaria .
&quot; thus the driver with@@ draws not additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; will the federal government check the legal framework &quot; , &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; thus Germany therefore wants to use internationally for example , that the permitted maximum @-@ speed limit for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 hours @-@ kilometres is lifted . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government is also intended to use the Vienna Convention for a change in the Vienna Convention , which has so far only seen the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; automated driving takes in increasing the car the guide , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based mainly on sensors and cameras that detect the environment and process the data within seconds .
&quot; according to a study presented by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways should be technically feasible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , free vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; the added value in the field of driver assistance systems and the highly automated driving functionality at the Germany &apos;s location , the authors estimate the study for 20@@ 25 to approximately 8,@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital connectivity of the P@@ k@@ ws can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD @-@ Monetary Policy S@@ ör@@ en Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; but the issue of liability in accidents , and the security of the personal data of the driver must be clear , however . &quot;
even the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans .
&quot; a survey conducted on Wednesday at the For@@ sa Institute , on behalf of the test conduct , DE@@ K@@ RA will believe that only eight percent of the Germans believe that autonomous cars will win over the next ten years , 32 percent do not even believe in the next 20 years , so 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 per cent of those surve@@ yed said to 20@@ 25 with autonomous cars , the USA is 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the motor@@ ists in Germany are not yet ready to rely entirely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a digital network , only seven per cent would agree to give control during the entire ride on all roads . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway , that could be expected in flowing traffic after about 15 percent , at the St@@ au 45 percent . &quot;
good every fourth would give the car the control under no circumstances .
B@@ oll says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
Düssel@@ dor@@ fer will only propose a stand on the front line of the championship from 25 September to 4 October only in the single .
the final decision should be handed down at the latest on September 22 .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the boys have experienced it in the morning , &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough , even without picking up the title , &quot; &quot; said Bundest@@ ra@@ iner Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf , during the European Championship . &quot;
the B@@ oll was on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsorship in China at this time .
the 34 year old German champion is expected to attend the Friday .
&quot; without Timo is the downside , we are now no longer such a clear favourite &quot; , &quot; stated single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the etz@@ als Trail in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , but also reminded of the European Championship 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Timo likewise had been missing , and we have become European champion . &quot;
&quot; in this we should be guided , &quot; explained the World Ran@@ gl@@ ist @-@ Fifth . &quot;
the English football team Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United has drawn a serious injury to the right leg .

Gau@@ l@@ tier is too old for an En@@ f@@ ant .
it is a blend of very big fashion show and a wax figur@@ ine : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : man@@ nequ@@ ins that can be scary about thanks to video @-@ proj@@ ections .
they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer which among other things with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits into the big star of fashion scene - and with it that he put men into skirts .
&quot; I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant , the Haute Cou@@ ture , because I have a white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be easy , in the meantime it is real , &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( V@@ om Civil stei@@ g on the cat@@ walk ) , which from September 18 began to be seen in the Kuns@@ thalle the HY@@ PO @-@ Kulturstiftung , is it a good fortune that the Mo@@ des@@ ch@@ ö@@ pper has changed its first with@@ standing post@@ ure to a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; actually , he had been , because , &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit of death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
when you dies the museum is coming into the museum .
&quot; the impressive collection had already been in Montreal , in the Montreal and in Paris . &quot;
&quot; it is so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of Kuns@@ thalle , Roger D@@ ieder@@ en . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits will give an insight into the man @-@ looking work of the man , the fashion history , without ever having a training . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically , the show is not structured , but it is an excellent chore@@ ograp@@ her overall art@@ works , for which much effort was operated : to fr@@ act the dolls , for example , he developed a style list . &quot;
14 tons of material have ar@@ ised the makers according to the according to the course of the curator Thierry @-@ Maxime L@@ ori@@ ot to Munich .
shortly before the start of the October Revolution there was still a special treat : a leather h@@ osen prints with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are clever as men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
Gau@@ l@@ tier old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , timi@@ d sal@@ d sal@@ es@@ try of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he attracted his Ted@@ dy B@@ HS and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; to play with a d@@ oll , his parents would not have allowed him . &quot;
he later applied the case of fashion as well .
he shaped fashion magazines and saw the dra@@ fts of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
later I bought it but of course .
for his first own fashion he could not pay the Mod@@ els .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the gear . &quot;
jewelry instead of wardrobe - Pl@@ au@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
&quot; it used to go to the long nit@@ rogen machines in and around Pl@@ aces therefore , metres . &quot;
&quot; the embro@@ i@@ dered substances and spi@@ kes were created in large quantities for customers , for example they worked for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work anymore , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the Mo@@ b flas@@ hes . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze , Fashion played a bigger role , and then replaced by the home textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt highlights some examples : top in jewelry , with accessories such as bags and regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; bil@@ de the so @-@ called Vintage @-@ Fashion , which opposed to past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , a growing potential . &quot;
those who are not serving no niche in Germany in the textile industry is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already make half of all orders . &quot;
Mo@@ cks Pl@@ aces is a member of the leading Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze and embro@@ ider@@ ies with nine other companies .
only they are allowed to carry the protected label .
&quot; in the last 15 years , roughly 80 percent of the revenue has been dis@@ continued . &quot;
there are almost no more private dealers in stores and also in the wholesale trade .
our products are hardly able to reach the customer on this path .
the mass ware is nowadays much cheaper than the Asian region and is almost exclusively sold via chains .
&quot; finally , the export of exports to Russia and the USA is weaker . &quot;
there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association is also trying to score points by environmental awareness , such as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer has explained by the nit@@ per@@ le in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; since that year we perform a seal of quality , which indicates that we are ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt comple@@ ments : &quot; this applies to the materials used .
diploma @-@ president U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berger outside of the Sax@@ on Academy of Z@@ wick@@ au - at the faculty for Applied Arts - and is specialized in embro@@ ider@@ ies and tips .
&quot; to counter@@ balance competition from the Asian region , you need to find high quality and innovative products . &quot;
this takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and factories , who have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
therefore an existing design can often only be slightly used to hold a customer base .
a few years ago , textile or@@ g@@ ymn@@ ast Kat@@ i Re@@ uter re@@ claimed the historic snow @-@ point . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the machine sti@@ f@@ les in some places small chi@@ cks . &quot;
&quot; the Pl@@ au@@ ener gol@@ ds@@ mi@@ tig@@ ress Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ zer was inspired ; &quot; before that , I could not do anything with traditional Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze . &quot;
now they are used the snow @-@ tops for their jewellery .
&quot; in an elaborate process , they character@@ ize the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people of the region identify with the topic Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze - young and old , &quot; Re@@ uter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , to Australia and to Finland - mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in Pl@@ asti@@ er and surroundings and who would like a mem@@ ento . &quot;
&quot; with this , I see my jewelry as a modern Ambassador of the Pl@@ au@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;

&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly &quot; it is not about a re@@ fr@@ aming , but a kind of continuation , which plays 20 years after the first film with the magical stro@@ kes . &quot;
this is about the experience of N@@ anny with the B@@ anks family in times of the world economic crisis in England .

XI pus@@ hes to open the economy wider for the world
&quot; the economy has to be able to open wider to out@@ wardly , to promote growth , President X@@ i Jin@@ ping , on Tuesday of a group which was commissioned with the steering wheel . &quot;
&quot; China should work out to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and to improve the strategies for start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the central leadership group for the deepening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; to promote new start and further reforms , new momentum and vitality bring about and new space for economic growth , said X@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the executive group has adopted a number of guidelines , including a neg@@ ativity to settle the border access , relaxation of the border controls policy , promoting state operators ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants of Mel@@ des@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative listing is created , the sectors and companies are identified , which are not in question for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually tested and improved by testing programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance because it provides a greater role in the provision of resources , a legally @-@ standard business environment ensuring the market open , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the government will also lo@@ osen controls on the powers transferred to the company , and make sure companies decide how they perform their business . &quot;
statement also stated that China border areas will allow new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; within the framework of an offer , state @-@ controlled sectors , more areas are open for private investments . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign finance and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to request a permanent residence permit or the &quot; Green Card &quot; if the requirements are optimized and the application process will be facilitated . &quot;
&quot; the right of lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to use a professional judge and pro@@ secut@@ ors , was also discussed during a meeting . &quot;
at the meeting also Premier Li Ke@@ qi@@ ang and important leaders like Li@@ u Yun@@ shan and Z@@ hang Ga@@ i participated as reported in a statement published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mer@@ cury limit in predat@@ ory fishing
the European Commission wants to double the threshold values for mer@@ cury in big vor@@ es and the consumers with it a significantly higher dose of nerve activity .
&quot; Consumer Protection F@@ ood@@ watch , who is presenting an appropriate working paper in the EU , critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side @-@ effects , with full weight to pregnant and infants , &quot; &quot; stated Matthias von F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t said the threshold values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as , as , for example , on two milli@@ gram mer@@ cury in kilograms of fish . &quot;
&quot; large rob@@ bery @-@ fish , however , are already so heavily under@@ mined today with mer@@ cury , that on the basis of the still current limits , about 50 percent of the catch length are not allowed to be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ accurate . &quot;
&quot; in return for this case , the EU wants to watch the limit values with other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ gram to 0.@@ 1 milli@@ gram mer@@ cury per kilo@@ gram . &quot;
&quot; F@@ ood@@ watch was described but referred to as &quot; trick , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ le@@ fish , such as car@@ p are usually so low stra@@ ined that they already keep the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the distr@@ action at Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; &quot; a per@@ fi@@ denti@@ al fle@@ ction &quot; , &quot; that alone helps the economy , &quot; &quot; stated Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
Mercury is a high @-@ toxic heavy metal that has become extremely rich in predat@@ ory food in the food chain .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; there are already low levels of suffering from harm to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains its guidelines in terms of prevailing , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; cannot be expected . &quot;
Mercury is mainly transported through the coal @-@ burning coal to the environment .
German coal fired power plants meet according to a written request of the Federal Ministry of eco to the Greens of the Party parliament . Ann@@ alena is more than six tons of mer@@ cury in the year 2000 , two thirds of the total amount in Germany em@@ itted . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mer@@ cury in fish approximately in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube is &quot; permanent and comprehensive &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; was quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
