B ) The community and the affected states take the necessary steps to ensure that in@@ spec@@ tors of the organization are actually able to feed them according to their agreements .
&quot; C ) The visits and activities of the insp@@ ections of the organization are thus set up , that i ) the potential har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the inspection of the peaceful nuclear tasks are as low as possible ; &quot;
II ) the protection of industrial ger@@ m and other the in@@ spec@@ tors of the organization to knowledge confidential information is ensured .
&quot; each state is opposed to the organization , including its assets , means and funds , as well as with their in@@ spec@@ tors and other officials , the tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the agreement on the prer@@ og@@ atives and liber@@ ations of the International At@@ omen@@ allergy organisation . &quot;
&quot; the backup measures after this Convention will be termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , when the community and the organization has been dil@@ uted , that it is used for a nuclear activity , which is no longer used for a nuclear activity , which is no longer used or virtually un@@ reco@@ ver@@ able . &quot;
the communion of the Organization according to this Convention shall be passing on the transfer of nuclear material from the states that is subject to the backup measures according to this Convention .
&quot; the backup measures after this agreement are termin@@ ated in relation to nuclear material , as soon as the recipient state , as in this Convention is assumed that the responsibility has taken over . &quot;
&quot; the organization guides documents , from which any disclosure and if necessary the re@@ application of the backup measures carried out on the level of nuclear material . &quot;
&quot; should nuclear material , the backup measures are subject to this Convention on non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of allo@@ ys or ceramics , so agreed to the community with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the backup measures can be completed in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the candle material is used during the period of non @-@ waste of the backup measures after this Convention is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons .
B ) The organization and the community meet a regulation that in this Convention will only be used as long as the nuclear material used in such activity .
&quot; in the regulation , as far as possible , how long and under which circumstances these backup measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the backup measures will be applied once again , once the nuclear material is re@@ led to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is given over the total quantity and composition of this in the concerned state or the state of material and on any disclosure of such material from this State or these states .
&quot; this explains their consent as quickly as possible ; however , it extends only on matters such as among other things time @-@ time and deport@@ ations for reporting , but does not exclu@@ de a endor@@ sement or loss of secrecy of the military activity and does not refer to the following use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the States bear the cost , each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations resulting from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; being created by the community , the States or persons who are subject to their territory , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of organization , so re@@ funded the organization of this cost , provided that they are pre@@ defined in advance . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation contributes to the costs of all additional measurements and sampling that are required by the inspection of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the community and states make sure that the liability for nuclear damage , including an insurance or other financial security , can be used for the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this convention in the same manner as the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim to which the community or a state in relation to the organization or the organization towards the community or a state of damages caused by a nuclear incident , which resulted from the implementation of the backup measures according to this agreement , is regulated in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; the Council asks for exam@@ ining the information provided by him from the General Director , that no nuclear material must be applied for nuclear weapons or other nuclear br@@ is , so he can refund the reports in Article XII paragraph C of the stat@@ utes , and where appropriate measures will take preced@@ ed there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps the Council has been taken into consideration of the Council , in which mass it has been attained by the applied security measures and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is affected - every den@@ om@@ able opportunity to give the advice the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; in search of the organization , the community or a state consultation on issues that arise from the interpretation or application of the Convention . &quot;

&quot; the community and the states name two refer@@ ee , the organization also separates two refer@@ ee , and the four so named arbit@@ rators choose a fifth , who has pres@@ ch@@ ased . &quot;
&quot; have the community and the states or the organisation are not named after the request to a refer@@ ee not the two refer@@ ee , thus the community or organisation of the President of the International Court shall seek to appoint this refer@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is to apply if bin@@ nen , or appointment of the fourth arbit@@ ration of the fifth refer@@ ee was not yet elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ral tri@@ bunal shall be seized , and all decisions require the approval of at least three arbit@@ rators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the arbit@@ ration are binding for the organization , the community and the countries concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Agreement occurs to non @-@ prolifer@@ ative states , the contractual party of the contract and members of the community , in force , i ) if the relevant state of the Organization to conclude that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this convention . &quot;
II ) if the community of the organisation notices that they are able to apply their backup actions in relation to this state for the purpose of this convention .
a ) The organization of the community and the states consult each other on request of a contract parties over a change of the Convention .
B ) All changes require the approval of the organization ; the community and the states .

the purpose of this part of the Convention is to set up in carrying out the provisions of the section I using hed@@ ging procedures as required .
&quot; the aim of the treatment measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of the diver@@ gen@@ ous quantities of nuclear nuclear material for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear br@@ ittle , for unknown purposes , as well as the deter@@ rent of such lo@@ vel@@ ment by the risk of early discovery . &quot;
&quot; to order in article 28 fixed target , the material post@@ ure will be used as a backup of fundamental importance , inter@@ ruption with the spatial input and observation as important suppl@@ em@@ ental actions . &quot;
&quot; the technical degree of insp@@ ections by the organization is carried out by an explanation , in which for any material image area , which is not listed for a specified period of time under specification of the accuracy of accuracy . &quot;
&quot; when carrying out their review , the organisation makes for articles 3 full use of the use of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for nuclear material in accordance with this Convention is based on a combination of material image .
&quot; with the application of their backup measures , the community of de procedures and measures will make use of this kind of use and , as far as necessary , as they are determined in the compl@@ ementary paragrap@@ hs and purpose . &quot;
&quot; a ) a meth@@ ane system to determine the quantities of preser@@ v@@ em , gener@@ alized , lost , abandoned , or other way from the stock of distant nuclear material and the matter of components ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and the assessment of measurement security ;
( C ) Proced@@ ure for determining the testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ;
e ) procedures for evaluation of accumulation of non @-@ measurement stocks and non @-@ smoking losses ;

g ) precau@@ tions that make sure that the accounting procedures and agreed correctly are carried out correctly ;
H ) procedures for the rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement of reports to the organization in line with the articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the backup measures will not extend to material in the mining industry or in the preparation process .
&quot; ( B ) is Ur@@ an - or th@@ ori@@ um@@ hal@@ ted material , which has not reached under single phase of the nuclear comb@@ us@@ tion cycle , in the States , thus shares the community of organisation the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves nuclear material , which is suitable for composition and purity for fuel production or the process phase , in which it is produced , or is introduced this nuclear material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear comb@@ us@@ sing cycle of nuclear material in the states , so it is subject to the others mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The backup measures planned in this Convention are not listed for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . are the community , however , in Article 11 , the evaluation of nuclear material , the backup measures are not possible or solic@@ ited , the organisation and community consult each other about the application of appropriate backup measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The backup measures planned in this Convention are termin@@ ated for nuclear material under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 , provided that the organization and community are inter@@ connected , that this nuclear material is practically non @-@ reco@@ vering . &quot;
&quot; in request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the organization of the material material from the backup measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) special sp@@ read@@ able material if it is used in gram@@ ms - or smaller amounts as sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after Article 13 , if such nuclear material is refundable , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with a Is@@ ot@@ on@@ centr@@ ation of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; if you are looking for the community releases the organization of nuclear material , the otherwise backup measures would be subject to this agreement , provided by these backup measures , provided the whole , due to this article in the states of liber@@ ated core material at no time more than &quot;
a ) total of a kil@@ og@@ y material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment of 0,@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and above , counting by multip@@ lication of its weight with the enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with an enrich@@ ment that lies under 0.@@ 2 ( 20 % ) and over the natural uran that is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the twenty @-@ reaching square of the enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten met@@ ric tons of natural uran and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of more than 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty met@@ ric tons de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an enrich@@ ment of 0.@@ 005 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should be fre@@ ed nuclear material along with nuclear material that is subject to the backup measures according to this Convention , processed or stored , so they will be made for the re@@ application of the backup measures on the material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplements which is required in the scope , which is required to the successful and effective acquisition of the tasks of the organization after this Convention , in particular , as the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
