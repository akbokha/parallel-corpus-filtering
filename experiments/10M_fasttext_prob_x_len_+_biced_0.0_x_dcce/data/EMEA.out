this document is a summary of the European Public Public Library report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ oph@@ thalm@@ ologists ( CH@@ MP ) has been assessed for recommendations on the use of drug .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or their treatment , please read the package position ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; for further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg tablets , as 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of mel@@ ting tablets ( tablets , which dis@@ solve in the mouth ) , as a solution to one ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection @-@ resolution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ ing thinking and Spe@@ aking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or vision of things that are not present ) , distr@@ ust and ins@@ ulates ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a psych@@ ic disorder , where the patients were man@@ ic episodes ( periods of ab@@ normal sky@@ light ) altern@@ ately with periods of normal mood . &quot;
&quot; ather@@ fy is used for the treatment of severe to heavy man@@ ic episodes , and to the prevention of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past . &quot;
injection @-@ solution is applied for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution can be applied to one or the mel@@ ting @-@ coated tablets in patients where the loop of tablets are difficulties . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking other medicines simultaneously , which are being built just like atri@@ fy , should be adjusted to the dose of bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter , &quot; i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole probably appears above all as a &quot; parti@@ te agate &quot; for the recept@@ ors for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter D@@ op@@ amin and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( also ser@@ otonin ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters appears to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder play a role , contributes Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , causing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and it will be prevented . &quot;
&quot; A@@ bili@@ fy &apos;s effectiveness to prevent the symptoms of symptoms , was investigated in three studies over up to one year . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of inj@@ ecting solution was compared in two studies at 8@@ 05 patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or similar diseases , which compared to increased un@@ rest , compared to a period of two hours with a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , A@@ bili@@ fy has been stabil@@ ised about twelve weeks at 3@@ 47 patients with Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of ather@@ fy and plac@@ ebo that have been stabil@@ ised at 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with bili@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of bili@@ fy inj@@ ecting solution was compared to 301 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , which suffered an increased un@@ rest , with which by Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti @-@ psych@@ otic ) and plac@@ ebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard sk@@ ala for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the company also led to study studies by exam@@ ining how the body conver@@ ts the mel@@ ting tablets , and the solution to Ein@@ res@@ or@@ bi@@ ert ( exp@@ ires ) . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies with the inj@@ ecting solution showed patients , the A@@ bili@@ fy in doses of 5,25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg received a significant increase in the symptoms increased un@@ rest than the patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in applying for the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , A@@ bili@@ fy is more effective than plac@@ ebo in four of the five short @-@ term studies . &quot;
&quot; ather@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks of effective than plac@@ ebo the revival of man@@ ic episodes in previously treated patients , and when it was administ@@ ered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
arom@@ atic inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 @-@ mg doses also decreased effective than plac@@ ebo the symptoms increased un@@ rest and were similar effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ bili@@ fy ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extrac@@ ting ( un@@ controll@@ able ) , dec@@ ay , nau@@ sea ( cit@@ ation ) , sali@@ va ( cooling ) , redness and exhaus@@ tion ( increased storage production ) , redness and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ ability ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran out to conclude that the benefits of ather@@ fy during the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and medium @-@ severe to severe man@@ ic episode in patients , which had mainly man@@ ic episodes , and with those the man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole said , compared to the risks . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the committee came to the result that the benefits of inj@@ ecting in@@ tru@@ ce and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes at Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a or@@ ale therapy is not suitable to over@@ lap the risks . &quot;
&quot; June 2004 , the European Commission shared the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmac@@ eutical Europe Ltd . a licence for the in@@ scription of bili@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar I@@ - disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients which had mainly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 10 or 15 mg / day at a time dose of 15 mg / day daily independent of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y in the treatment of schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients with 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; considering the larger sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 pre @-@ unit is set off from the combination of the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the appearance of su@@ ic@@ ide behaviour belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after changing an anti @-@ psychological therapy , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder , no tax risk associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in comparison to other anti @-@ psych@@ otic disorder . &quot;
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal veins , removal disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which was one year or less continuous , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ben@@ ding Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; if in one with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , patients treated signs and symptoms of a sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; when a patient develops signs and symptoms that have been put on a m@@ ns , or un@@ clear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , must be set . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used in patients with cl@@ amp@@ ons in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese or in states that are related to cr@@ amp@@ ons in relation to be used with caution . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in patients with psych@@ osis associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , an increased ster@@ ber@@ ation compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; but there were however in one of these studies , a study with fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the anus for unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole to patients . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with K@@ eto@@ azi@@ de or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was dealt with patients who were treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psychological compounds , including AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessment of hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia @-@ related events involving AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti @-@ psychological substance @-@ treated patients to allow direct compar@@ isons .
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients and in patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ i @-@ ste@@ amer , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic medication which is known as side @-@ effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ bu@@ z@@ ole on the central system , caution is advisable when Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ ole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines , such as se@@ coding ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 @-@ Ant@@ agonist Fam@@ ot@@ id@@ in , a mag@@ ens@@ acid blo@@ cker , reduces the res@@ or@@ der@@ rate of Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , whereby this effect is not relevant as clin@@ ically . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy proportions , a highly effective CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( Chin@@ id@@ in ) the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene um 107 % , while the C@@ max remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to expect other high @-@ effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction . &quot;
&quot; with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) Met@@ abol@@ isi@@ ans , the joint application with highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher Plas@@ mak@@ onic centr@@ ations in comparison to CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive Met@@ abol@@ ishing . &quot;
&quot; if one draws the common gift of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol or other highly effective CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , should be considered the potential benefits of potential risks to patients . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ trac@@ on@@ az@@ ol and HIV proteins , are supposed to have similar effects and therefore should be made similar dosage reduction . &quot;
after lowering the CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors should be raised the dosage from AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y to the dos@@ ages before the start of the companion therapy .
&quot; Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can be administ@@ ered together with AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y , can be reck@@ oned with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentr@@ ations . &quot;
in clinical studies have no significant effect on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of the sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ methodology ) , 2@@ C@@ 9 ( War@@ far@@ in ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( Om@@ ep@@ ra@@ ole ) and 3@@ A4 ( dex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ osis ) . &quot;
patients should come to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for safety in humans and due to the concerns studies , this medicine should not be applied in pregnancy , unless the potential benefit is clearly the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , in other anti @-@ psych@@ otic medication , patients should be war@@ ned before , dangerous machines , including power vehicles , to operate , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole has no negative influence on it . &quot;
the following effects occurred frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) on than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ side effects ( * ) classified :
&quot; frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia - In a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks entered with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , a total of lower incidence ( 25,@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Par@@ kin@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ ering , D@@ yst@@ onie and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia ( 5@@ 7,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole treatment and 13.5 % in patients suffering from plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % was treated with patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , and 15.@@ 1 % in patients suffering from O@@ lan@@ zap@@ in therapy . &quot;

&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment . &quot;
during the long @-@ term period of 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole and plac@@ ebo on which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ vigor@@ ously controlled laboratory parameters occurred , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ atin @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;
&quot; to the side effects which may occur in connection with an anti @-@ psychological therapy , and over whose appearance also has been reported in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , sp@@ ig@@ dy@@ nasty events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies and since the market launch , acci@@ dental or inten@@ sely acute super@@ do@@ ings with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole alone was observed by adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; while there are no information about the effectiveness of a her@@ man@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ ben@@ zene ; however , it is unlikely that Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis has been used in the treatment of an over@@ dose of benefits , since Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole has a high plas@@ ma @-@ conversion . &quot;
it is assumed that the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zene in schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and Bi@@ polar @-@ I distur@@ b@@ ance on the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on D@@ op@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ a- recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ otonin 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ a recept@@ ors is convey@@ ed .

in three plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled short @-@ time studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1.@@ 228 schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients with positive or negative symptoms showed Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole in comparison to plac@@ ebo a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of the psych@@ otic symptoms .
&quot; in a Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol @-@ controlled study was 52 of the proportion of the Res@@ p@@ onder patients , which contributed to the study media in both groups ( Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole 77 % and Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values which were defined as secondary studies , including PAN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery As@@ berg@@ - depress@@ ants scale , showed a significant stronger improvement than with semi@@ op@@ eri@@ dol . &quot;
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks of stabil@@ ised patients with chronic schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia showed itself a significant higher reduction of the return rate which was at 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole group and at 57 % below plac@@ ebo .

in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with fixed dosage with patients with an man@@ ic or mixed @-@ episode of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder showed Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole to plac@@ ebo no superior efficacy .
&quot; in two Plac@@ ing and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies about 12 weeks in patients with an man@@ ic or mixed episode of a Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , with or without a psych@@ otic characteristics , showed Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole a compared to plac@@ ebo out@@ going effectiveness in week 3 and an un@@ sustainable effect that was comparable to that of li@@ thium or Hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol , week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ z@@ ole also pointed out a compar@@ ative share of patients with symptom@@ atic Rem@@ is@@ sion of the Man@@ ie on such as li@@ thium or hal@@ op@@ eri@@ dol .

&quot; with Ari@@ pi@@ pe@@ z@@ ole there are no differences in the pharmaceutical in@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic between male and female healthy proportions , as well as shown in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation of no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a non @-@ specific analysis of pharmac@@ ogen@@ ine@@ tics revealed no reference to clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of the smoking on the pharmaceutical in@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ ge@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zol were similar to patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency in comparison to young healthy proportions .

AB@@ ILI@@ F@@ Y inj@@ ecting solution will be applied for quick control of Agi@@ ess and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder when a or@@ ale therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be termin@@ ated with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole solution and started with the oral use of Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; to boost the res@@ or@@ ption and minimize the vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep in the glut@@ eus @-@ Maxim@@ us muscle is recommended by adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can depend on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines or ak@@ ut @-@ therapy procedure ( see Section 4.5 ) .

there are no investigations on the effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole injection solution in patients with Agi@@ it@@ eness and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were different from schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ enia and man@@ ic episodes of the Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder .
&quot; if a par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ inen in addition to Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zol inj@@ ecting solution is necessary as necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme conditions or a blood pressure ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on safety and effectiveness of Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ zol inj@@ ecting solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug po@@ ison@@ ing ( by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal veins , removal disorders ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , hy@@ po@@ vol@@ a@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; Sp@@ ät@@ dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies , which was one year or less continuous , there were occasional reports on during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ ns are high fever , muscle divisions , altern@@ ating consciousness and signs autonomous instability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ die , swe@@ ating and cardi@@ ac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , Poly@@ ur@@ ie , poly@@ ph@@ ag@@ ie and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should regularly monitored in relation to a deterioration of gl@@ uc@@ ose values . &quot;
&quot; a weight gain is generally observed at schi@@ z@@ op@@ hr@@ ine patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to comb@@ i @-@ ste@@ amer , the use of anti@@ psych@@ otic substances , where weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the Sed@@ ation was greater compared to the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , in a study , used in the healthy Pro@@ b@@ anden Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole ( 15 mg dose ) as a m@@ ural in@@ tra @-@ kul@@ ele ( 2 mg dose ) in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular . &quot;

the following effects occurred in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole injection solution more frequently ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 ) than plac@@ ebo or were classified as possible medical @-@ side effects ( * ) classified ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; frequency of the side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : frequently ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects occurred frequent on ( &gt; 1 / 100 ) than in plac@@ ebo or were classified in clinical trials with oral an@@ gler as possible medical @-@ effects side effects ( * ) classified ( see Section 5.1 ) :
in a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study of 26 weeks was the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13,@@ 1 % in patients suffering from plac@@ ebo .
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17,@@ 6 % for those under li@@ thium treatment . &quot;
during the long @-@ term period of 26 weeks at a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled study was the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients suffering from Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for plac@@ ebo patients .
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole and plac@@ ebo on which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ in@@ vigor@@ ously controlled laboratory parameters occurred , revealed no medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; enh@@ ancements of the CP@@ K ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients with Ari@@ pi@@ b@@ ole , compared to 2,@@ 0 % of patients treated with plac@@ ebo patients . &quot;

• School paper@@ back • summary of the characteristics of the medication by means ( professional information ) , lab@@ eling and pack@@ ets . • With unique imaging presentation of the correct use of the product cool@@ ant cooling boxes for the transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ ol@@ amed is similar to a biological medicine , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also &quot; reference quart@@ z &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood flow , in which in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion complications might occur if before the procedure is not possible and where a blood loss of 900 to 1 800 ml is expected . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician , which has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases , which the drug is shown . &quot;
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make their own blood circulation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to inj@@ ected into a v@@ ene . &quot;
injection can also be made from the patient or its super@@ visor unless they have received proper guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney suff@@ iciency or in patients who receive a chemotherapy , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s should always be in recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ ites in adults or between 9,@@ 5 and 11 g / dl with children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron values of all patients are facing the treatment to ensure that no iron gel exists , and iron supplements should be administ@@ ered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who receive a chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems can be caused an an@@ a@@ emia caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency or therefore , that the body is not sufficient for the body &apos;s body thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin will also be applied before operations to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a blood@@ shed .
&quot; it is produced by a cell , into which a gene has been introduced ( DNA ) , which they are capable of forming epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with administration as an injection in a v@@ ene as part of a main study with 4@@ 79 patients , which caused by kidney problems caused by kidney disease . &quot;
&quot; all patients participating in this study was at least eight weeks in E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , before they were put into se@@ amed , or received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
the main indi@@ c@@ ator for effectiveness was the change of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s between the beginning of the study and the distribution period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
&quot; the company also placed the results of a study , where the effects of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined for 114 cancer patients who received chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; in the study with patients suffering caused by kidney problems caused by kidney disease , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s were maintained in the same degree as for those patients who continue to have E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to these patients showed the patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o , a rise from 0.@@ 0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12.5 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side @-@ effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which occasionally lead to symptoms of an En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , st@@ alling head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any other components .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ecting under the skin is not recommended to treat kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that there is no allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) was agreed to conclude that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union of proof , the drug has an comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mp@@ symptoms and fol@@ lic@@ tions can vary depending on age , gender and overall disease , therefore the assessment of the individual clinical trial and disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
a rise in hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s around more than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the variation between patients , occasionally in a patient individual hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s can occasionally be observed or below the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ der should be obtained via an appropriate dosage management , the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin audi@@ ation of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;

patients should be monitored eng@@ ma@@ y to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is required in the lowest dose which is required for controlling the an@@ emia and the An@@ a@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initial very low H@@ B value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3,75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may possibly need higher earnings less heavy ( H@@ B &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 i.e. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which once a weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before the surgical procedure and the day of intervention ( Day 0 ) should be given . &quot;

patients suffering from treatment with any ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin at a ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ia ( Pure Red C@@ ell A@@ pl@@ asia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or another ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin ( see Section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ia ) . &quot;

&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery , the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are subject to participate in the following pre@@ - , esc@@ ort or gr@@ ading diseases , v@@ ascular disorder , v@@ ascular or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular illness ; in patients with recently inv@@ oked heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
Er@@ y@@ thro@@ blast@@ open@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rarely has been reported on the appearance of an an@@ tic@@ kl@@ ed PR@@ CA to Mon@@ at@@ e- and for years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous Er@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden use , defined as reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for non @-@ speaking ( iron , Fol@@ low @-@ acid , infections or inflammation , blood loss and h@@ it@@ oly@@ sis ) are investigated . &quot;
&quot; if the re@@ ap@@ ul@@ oc@@ yst value , considering the an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tic oc@@ y@@ tes or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thy@@ ro@@ id and leu@@ ko@@ zy@@ ten@@ ites , and if no other reason for an active ingredient is intended , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row for the diagnosis of a PR@@ CA . &quot;
&quot; the data for immun@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y in sub@@ cut@@ aneous application of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ in@@ duced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient . &quot;
8 In patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin targets .
clinical studies have been observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese risk has been observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ese @-@ stimul@@ ated active ingredients ( ESA ) were given by a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ - target con@@ dens@@ ation of more than 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
controlled clinical trials have no significant benefit that is attri@@ but@@ able to the gift of epo@@ chs if the hem@@ ost@@ bin@@ bin@@ ation con@@ dens@@ ation is required for controlling the An@@ ä@@ mi@@ es@@ y@@ mp@@ symptoms and avoiding blood trans@@ forms required .
the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ched should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 5.@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of an increase in hyper@@ tension .
in patients with chronic kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency and clin@@ ically evi@@ ate coron@@ ary coron@@ ary disease or in@@ suff@@ iciency should not be exceeded under Section 4.2 recommended upper limit of the hem@@ og@@ glo@@ bin targets .
&quot; after the present knowledge , the treatment of an@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , the progression of kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency is not accelerated . &quot;
in tum@@ our patients under chemotherapy it should be considered for assessing the therapy @-@ efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ gift and ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin @-@ response ( patient that may be trans@@ acted ) .
if the H@@ B rise is larger than 2 g / dl ( 1.25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ B value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) must be adjusted to keep the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ atic an@@ emia ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) to keep the risk of possible th@@ rom@@ atic an@@ emia - dosage adjustment between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
&quot; the decision for application re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit risk to the participation of each patient , which should also take into account the specific clinical context . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery , if possible , prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy , the cause of an@@ emia is examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
patients suffering from a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery should be an appropriate Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ os@@ e@@ prophy@@ la@@ xis should have an adequate risk of th@@ rom@@ atic and v@@ ascular diseases , especially in an underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for patients with a starting @-@ mo@@ er value of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk for post@@ operative botan@@ ically / v@@ ascular events . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled studies , for epo@@ chs , it has not been proven that they can survive at tum@@ our patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ emia or dimin@@ ishing the risk of tum@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; 4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer , which got back chemotherapy when a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin target con@@ cent@@ ation of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was increased . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied together with Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in controls and the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ ind@@ osis are adapted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ investigations on tum@@ ours , there are no evidence of a interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ C@@ SF or GM @-@ C@@ SF concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differenti@@ ation or prolifer@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; about th@@ rom@@ atic , v@@ ascular events such as m@@ yo@@ kar@@ di@@ ale ion , glob@@ alized Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , arter@@ ial Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis , neur@@ in@@ al@@ thro@@ mb@@ osis and 11 blood cl@@ ashes in artificial kid@@ neys , were also reported in patients under ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment , so also patients under epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dos@@ is@@ dependence of blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
a increased incidence of thro@@ mb@@ ov@@ ask@@ eting events ( see Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine .
independent from the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treatment it may occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular diseases after repeated blood don@@ ate and v@@ ascular complications .

survival and tum@@ ours were examined in five great controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double blind plac@@ ebo@@ arding studies and
in the open study there was no difference in total survive between the combination with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin treated patients and the control of the control .

&quot; it consists of maneu@@ ver@@ able risk of thro@@ em@@ bo@@ char@@ gers with tum@@ our patients with re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin , and a negative impact on the overall survive cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are applied to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human@@ ic ery@@ thro@@ po@@ e@@ tin in tum@@ our patients with the aim of achieving a hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ ess among 13 g / dl , because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the tested data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa provisions following repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ time period of about 4 hours in healthy proportions and a somewhat prolonged half @-@ value of approximately 5 hours in patients with kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency .

&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et are taking at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should be taken before the first inf@@ usion a great dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) oral or by inj@@ ecting into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( means against inflammation ) just after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta can be reduced in the three days after the inf@@ usion , such as fever , muscle pain , gri@@ p@@ pe@@ ous symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta is allowed to be prescribed by physicians who have experience in treating this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cl@@ asta the same is as in z@@ om@@ eta , a part of the data material for z@@ eta was attracted to review by A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; at the first study nearly 8 000 older women were involved with oste@@ opor@@ osis , and it was examined the number of sp@@ ine and hip frac@@ tures over a period of three years . &quot;
&quot; the second study conducted 2 127 men and women with oste@@ opor@@ osis over 50 years , which recently suffered a gir@@ affe ; it was examined the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years . &quot;
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was compared with two studies to a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared six months with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bite ) . &quot;
the main indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was whether the sal@@ ary phosph@@ or@@ ase in the Ser@@ um ( enzy@@ me that is building bone subtle ) in the blood again or at least 75 % compared to the output .
in the study with older women the risk of sp@@ frac@@ tures in patients among A@@ cl@@ asta ( without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) over a period of three years compared to the patients below plac@@ ebo around 70 % .
compared to all patients under A@@ cl@@ asta ( with or without other oste@@ opor@@ osis ) with those under plac@@ ebo the risk of gir@@ affe was reduced by 41 % .
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture had 9 % of patients under A@@ cl@@ asta a Fr@@ ac@@ upuncture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients below plac@@ ebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most side effects of A@@ cl@@ asta occur within the first three days after inf@@ usion and are less common with repeti@@ tive inf@@ usions .
A@@ cl@@ asta may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ ate or one of the other components .
&quot; as in all bis@@ phosph@@ ates are subject to patients at A@@ cl@@ asta the risk of kidney , reactions to the inf@@ usion set and oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( Ab@@ die of bone tissue ) in the ja@@ ws . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cl@@ asta provides assistance material for doctors prepared to use the A@@ cl@@ asta to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis , as well as the medicine is to apply as well as the material for patients , where the side effects of the drug should be explained and pointed out when they should turn to the doctor . &quot;

&quot; in patients with low @-@ traum@@ atic gir@@ ac@@ upuncture , the administration of the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operational supply of hip frac@@ ture is recommended ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et , A@@ cl@@ asta was to be prescribed by physicians who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et with A@@ cl@@ asta was observed a long re@@ mission period in patients who addressed the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of calcium amount , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta to ensure ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

patients with kidney dys@@ functions ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for these patients .
older patients ( &gt; 65 years ) A dosage adjustment is not necessary as the bio@@ availability of distribution and Eli@@ mination in older patients similar to younger .
children and young people A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended for use in children and young people under 18 years of age since data are missing .
A@@ cl@@ asta is not recommended in patients with severe kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) as for these patient population only limited clinical experience .
a pre @-@ existing Hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia is before the start of therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta by adequate supply of calcium and vitamin D ( see Section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the fast entry of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , with symptom@@ atic hy@@ po@@ kal@@ ine a@@ emia is able to develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta occurs ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly twice daily at least 500 mg of calcium amount , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta to ensure ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;

&quot; for patients , the dental gri@@ ps require , do not have data available to whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ ates have reduced the risk for oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the oral area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the treating doctor should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and are based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
&quot; the incidence of symptoms , which occur within the first three days after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , can be reduced by gift from Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of as serious side @-@ effects reported cases of pre @-@ hop@@ eless cases was in patients who received A@@ cl@@ asta , ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3,@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients who received plac@@ ebo ( 0.6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the oste@@ opor@@ osis studies ( PFT , HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON - Recur@@ rent Fr@@ ac@@ ture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall prevalence of atri@@ al fi@@ brill@@ ation between A@@ cl@@ asta ( 2,@@ 6 % ) and plac@@ ebo ( 2,@@ 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) unwanted medicines are listed in table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dys@@ functions Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic , was associated with kidney dys@@ functions , which is referred to as a decrease in the kidney function ( i.e. , an increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins ) , and in rare cases as an acute kidney failure . &quot;
the change in the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( measured annually before the administration ) and the appearance of kidney function were measured in a clinical trial at oste@@ opor@@ osis over three years compared between the A@@ cl@@ ast@@ a- and the plac@@ ebo group .
a temporary increase in the Ser@@ um Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of gift was observed at 1.8 % of the patients with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients to 0.8 % of patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; based on the evaluation of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below 2,@@ 3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in a large clinical study treated patients compared to 21 % of the patients treated with A@@ cl@@ asta in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et studies . &quot;
&quot; all patients have received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium found in the study on post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al oste@@ opor@@ osis , in the study on avoidance of clinical frac@@ tures after a gir@@ dles and in the Mor@@ bus @-@ Pag@@ et Studies ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study for the prevention of clinical frac@@ tures , the vitamin D mirror was not rout@@ in@@ vigor@@ ously measured , however , the majority of patients received an initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
local reactions After the administration of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the inf@@ usion set like redness , swelling and / or pain , reported ( 0.7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen in the cran@@ ial area , especially during cancer patients , about oste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sen ( pri@@ ws in the max@@ im ) reported the with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refers to cancer patients according to tooth extraction or other dental print . &quot;

A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated patients from 75 years and older had a total of 60 % decreased risk for sp@@ ine frac@@ tures compared to plac@@ ebo patients ( p &lt; 0.@@ 0001 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cl@@ asta refers to a steady effect on three years , which resulted in a total of 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) reduced risk to hip frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; effect on the bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cl@@ asta increased the bone density at the Len@@ den@@ si@@ cal acid , hips and at the dist@@ al radius compared to plac@@ ebo treatment ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;

a micro@@ computer @-@ based ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed in comparison with A@@ cl@@ asta treated patients compared to plac@@ ebo an increase in the tr@@ ul@@ ek@@ ul@@ ary bone vol@@ um@@ ens and the preservation of the tr@@ ul@@ ular bone architecture .

&quot; the vitamin D mirror were not rout@@ in@@ vigor@@ ously measured , but the majority of patients received an initial ss@@ d@@ osis vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. oral or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular ) 2 weeks before the inf@@ usion . &quot;
the overall mort@@ ality was about 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group of A@@ cl@@ asta treated group compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the plac@@ ebo group .

the A@@ cl@@ asta treatment led over 24 months compared to plac@@ ebo treatment to increase the BM@@ D to 5.5 % of the total amount and around 4.3 % at the thig@@ h .
clinical effectiveness in men in HO@@ RI@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT @-@ study were judged 5@@ 08 men random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was judged by 24 months .
&quot; the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7,5 % at A@@ cl@@ asta @-@ treated men compared to 8,@@ 7 % in plac@@ ebo . &quot;

11 The effectiveness of an inf@@ usion of 5 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at once daily during 2 months was detected in two six months studies .
the combined results was observed after 6 months a similar decrease of pain @-@ strength and pain@@ ters compared to the output value for A@@ cl@@ asta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at .

&quot; unique and multi @-@ fold 5 and 15 minutes continuous inf@@ usions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data that proved to be dos@@ is@@ independently . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plas@@ mas@@ s@@ ails quickly took on &lt; 10 % of the peak after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long lasting phase very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the top value . &quot;

&quot; the overall body Clear@@ ance is independent of the dose 5,@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h and remains un@@ influenced by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the inf@@ usion period of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ g@@ äu@@ re@@ - concentration around 30 % at the end of the inf@@ usion but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ation against time ) .
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance by Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom @-@ P@@ 450 @-@ En@@ z@@ ym@@ systems metabo@@ lic substances is unlikely because Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid at the human being is not metabo@@ li@@ zed , and because it is a f@@ aint or no more direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , metabo@@ lic In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P@@ 450@@ - &quot;

it follows that a light ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and an excessive kidney feature up to 35 ml / min does not require a dosage adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid .
there is only limited data for heavy kidney disease ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) only limited data are possible for this population .
acute tox@@ icity The highest not let@@ al @-@ faced single @-@ osis was with mice 10 mg / kg body weight and with rats 0.6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in dogs of dogs were tr@@ acked of 1,0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ fold of the recommended human therapeutic exposure ) , administ@@ ered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ unci@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chron@@ ous and chronic tox@@ icity in trials with intraven@@ ous application was defined as 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals ; in dogs , a 15 @-@ minute inf@@ usion in 3 @-@ day intervals , administ@@ ered in interval of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose which corresponds to the he@@ ater of human therapeutic exposure , related to the AU@@ C , corresponds to the AU@@ C , corresponds ) . &quot;

&quot; the most common sense of studies with repeti@@ tive application was a multip@@ lied spon@@ gi@@ osa in the met@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal ar@@ quit@@ ous bone of animals in the growth phase with virtually all dos@@ ages , a respon@@ sive , which reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ res@@ or@@ ative effect of the substance . &quot;

&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is a representative of a sub@@ st@@ anz@@ ant class , which is called bis@@ phosph@@ ate , and is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women , the oste@@ opor@@ osis in men and the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et des Kno@@ wer . &quot;
&quot; ble@@ eding blood levels of sex hormones , primarily o@@ est@@ rogen , which are formed from and@@ rogen , play a role in rather gradual loss of bone mass , which is observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et takes place the bone structure too fast , and new bone material is built un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material we@@ aker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cl@@ asta works by adding the bone structure again norm@@ alised , creating a normal bone @-@ building and thus gives the bone again strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or to get involved in dental surgery , inform your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; for application of A@@ cl@@ asta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if you have other medicines / apply or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor it is especially important to know if you are taking medicine , known to them that they as@@ ham@@ ed the kid@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; for application of A@@ cl@@ asta along with foods and drinks , you are concerned that you should take enough fluid according to the instructions of your doctor before and after the treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
oste@@ opor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year that is administ@@ ered by your doctor or care as inf@@ usion into one V@@ ene .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , is recommended to increase the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating care of the gir@@ dle . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et The usual dose is 5 mg , which is administ@@ ered by your doctor or care as inf@@ usion into one V@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ cl@@ asta works for a long time , you may need a further dose than after one year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium mirror in your blood within the time after inf@@ usion is not too low .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pag@@ et can work A@@ cl@@ asta longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a renewed treatment . &quot;
if the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta suits you immediately with your doctor or hospital in connection to arrange a new date .
&quot; before ending the therapy with A@@ cl@@ asta If you consider the ter@@ mination of treatment with A@@ cl@@ asta to@@ es , please take your next doctor &apos;s min and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first inf@@ usion are often referred to ( with more than 30 % of the patients ) are still less common after the subsequent inf@@ usion .
fever and sho@@ ok , muscle - or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cl@@ asta is causing this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you get A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs for one to low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cr@@ acking or kri@@ b@@ ob@@ n@@ des or num@@ b feeling , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;

persistent pain and / or not healing wo@@ unds in the mouth or on the ja@@ ws were reported mainly in patients who were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; about allergic reactions , including rare cases of breathing problems , bo@@ iler attack and angi@@ o@@ ö@@ bes ( such as swelling on the face , the tongue or in throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff , if one of the listed side effects you can greatly imp@@ acted or you notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information . &quot;
&quot; if the drug is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage period and conditions up to the application ; normally 24 h at 2 ° C to 8 ° C will not be exceeded . &quot;
&quot; patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic gir@@ ac@@ upuncture is recommended , inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta two or more weeks after the operating supply of hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after administration of A@@ cl@@ asta , patients need to be sufficiently supplied with fluid ; this is especially important in patients who receive a di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; because of the fast entry of the effect of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hy@@ po@@ kal@@ z@@ emia develop , whose maximum usually occurs within the first 10 days after the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure an adequate supply of calcium , accordingly at least twice daily 500 mg of calcium amount , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cl@@ asta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recent low @-@ traum@@ atic gir@@ affe , a initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 i.e. or@@ nam@@ ental or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular vitamin D prior to the inf@@ usion of A@@ cl@@ asta is recommended . &quot;

the summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Public Agen@@ ts report ( EP@@ AR ) in which explains how the Committee for Human@@ oph@@ thalm@@ ologists ( CH@@ MP ) has been assessed for recommendations on the use of drug .
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type @-@ 2 diabetes ( also known as not ins@@ ulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be applied alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in which met@@ form@@ in ( a di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ al medicine ) is not displayed . • It can be applied together with another di@@ ab@@ et@@ es@@ medi@@ medicine ( du@@ al@@ therapy ) .
&quot; in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) are applied , which cannot be satisfactory with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ ated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a s@@ wir@@ yl@@ har@@ p or ins@@ ulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ n@@ fuel or ins@@ ulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ yl@@ harm@@ ac@@ tic or ins@@ ulin , except for patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here should be reduced the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ &apos;s or ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s own ins@@ ulin can better be used and the blood sugar levels can be improved , thus enabling type @-@ 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; with more than 1 400 patients the effectiveness of acet@@ account in tri@@ ple@@ therapy has been studied , in addition , patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ p , in addition they received either to 3.5 years either Ac@@ tos or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , which shows how good the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos led to a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which can conclude that the blood sugar levels were lo@@ wered by 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ y study , the effect of the additional gift of accounts for existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ fon@@ yl har@@ p in a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values at the reduction of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values , while the additional g@@ abe of plac@@ ebo led to a reduction of vegetable % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study , in which the combination of acet@@ tos and ins@@ ulin at 28@@ 9 patients were examined , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to ins@@ ulin , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who took additional plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common effects associated with acet@@ tos were visual disorders , infections of the upper respir@@ atory tract , weight gain and hy@@ po@@ aes@@ th@@ esia ( dimin@@ ished sensitivity to travel ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be applied to patients either in patients ( allergic ) to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver issues , heart @-@ suff@@ iciency or di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebox - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos will serve as an alternative to the standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not shown . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission shared the Company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited a licence for the transport of accounts within the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to white , round , curved and carry on one side the mark@@ ings &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the heading &quot; AC@@ TOS . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is also shown in combination with ins@@ ulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar has been inadequate and where metals are un@@ suitable because of contr@@ ain@@ dic@@ ations or in@@ compatibility . ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for use pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 18 years of age are no data available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering due to the presence of at least one risk factor ( e.g. former heart attack or symptom@@ atic coron@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose of stage . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed in signs and symptoms of a heart @-@ suff@@ iciency , weight increase or oil , especially those with reduced kar@@ di@@ aler reserve . &quot;
patients should be observed at signs and symptoms of a heart @-@ suff@@ iciency , weight increase and fur@@ rows when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in combination with ins@@ ulin is applied . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mak@@ rov@@ ascular disorder has been performed .
&quot; in this study , an increase in reports on heart in@@ suff@@ iciency , which did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output levels ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the standard range ) or with other signs of liver disease may not be used Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to the 3 @-@ times of the upper limit of the standard range , the liver enzy@@ me are as soon as possible to control . &quot;
&quot; if a patient developed symptoms developed to a hep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ clari@@ fied nau@@ sea , fatigue , appeti@@ te , fatigue , appeti@@ peti@@ t@@ lessness and / or dar@@ ker Har@@ n , are the liver enzy@@ me to review . &quot;
&quot; the decision whether treating the patient with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , should be led up to the advance of the laboratory parameters of the clinical evaluation . &quot;
clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has been proven to be a dos@@ is@@ dependent weight increase which is due to obesity and in some cases with a liquid re@@ ten@@ tion .
as a result of a her@@ ap@@ lu@@ tion stood under the therapy with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a low reduction reduction of the middle hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.3 % ) .
similar changes were observed in compar@@ ative controlled studies with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s around 3 @-@ 4 % and ins@@ ulin ( relative reduction of the hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ s around 1 @-@ 2 % and the hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its around 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of the increased In@@ sul@@ ph@@ ectivity of patients , the Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on as or@@ ale or triple @-@ combination therapy with ins@@ ulin , the risk of dos@@ is@@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; following the launch of the launch was reported under treatment with Thi@@ az@@ oli@@ d@@ indi@@ onen , including Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , on a appearance or a deterioration of a di@@ ab@@ etic m@@ acular o@@ eu@@ vre with a reduction of the vision@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and the up@@ surge of Mak@@ ul@@ a@@ ö@@ de@@ es , if patients report on disorders of visual impair@@ ment ; a suitable oph@@ thalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of announ@@ cements from random@@ ised , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients who were treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the frac@@ ture incidence was 1,@@ 9 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on untreated women and 1,@@ 1 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient @-@ years for women who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a study over 3.5 years to investigate cardiovascular diseases , Fr@@ ak@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5,@@ 1 % ; 1.0 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patients ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients , compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 Fr@@ ak@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy , and if a patient wishes a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is ab@@ ject ( see Section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies for exam@@ ining the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effects on Pharmac@@ ology or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are metabo@@ li@@ zed by these enzy@@ mes , e.g. or@@ ale contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ ers . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) result in an increase in AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on around the 3 @-@ fold .
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 In@@ du@@ p ) result in lowering the AU@@ C by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 54 % .
this is due to that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on which dimin@@ ished in pregnancy and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ate for the fat growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; common &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; rarely &gt; 1 / 10000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10000 , single cases : unknown ( from present data does not fail ) . &quot;
&quot; these lead to a temporary change in the Tur@@ g@@ ors and the b@@ illing index@@ es of the lens , as they are also observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic agents . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ tions appeared on the triple the upper limit of the stand@@ ings frequently on how to plac@@ ebo , however rare than in compar@@ ative groups under met@@ form@@ in or Sul@@ fon@@ yl@@ har@@ p . &quot;
in a out@@ come study in patients with pre @-@ advanced mak@@ rov@@ ascular disorder was the incidence of heavy duty in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on by 1.6 % higher than in plac@@ ebo when Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on b@@ z@@ w .
&quot; since the launch has rarely been reported on heart in@@ suff@@ iciency under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , however , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was used in combination with ins@@ ulin or in patients with heart @-@ suff@@ iciency in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of reports of unwanted events relating to bone armament made from random@@ ised , controlled , double blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3,5 years with more than 8.@@ 100 patients in patients treated with compar@@ isons treated groups . &quot;
&quot; over a period of 3.5 years current pro@@ active study , Fr@@ ak@@ tures at 44 / 870 ( 5.2 % ) of patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated patients compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients who were treated with a compar@@ ative media . &quot;
&quot; at intake the high@@ d@@ osis of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days occurred no symptoms . &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on seems to act on an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator Activ@@ ated Rec@@ ept@@ or @-@ g ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ g ) ) which leads to an increased In@@ sul@@ in@@ sensi@@ tivity of Leb@@ er- and Skelet@@ on cells .
it could be shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduces gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver and increases the periph@@ eral gl@@ cos@@ ity in case of ins@@ ulin resistance .
a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de as Mon@@ otherapy has been continued over two years to investigate the time until the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &gt; 8,@@ 0 % after the first six treatment formats ) .
&quot; at the time after two years after the treatment of therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,@@ 0 % ) by Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on at 69 % of patients treated ( compared to 50 % of patients under Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de ) . &quot;
&quot; in a plac@@ ebo@@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar have been inadequate despite three @-@ month optimization phase with ins@@ ulin , to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo random@@ ized . &quot;
&quot; in patients under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the middle H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c - value to 0,45 % , compared to patients who received only ins@@ ulin ; a reduction of ins@@ ulin products treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on treated group was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies over a year , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ quart@@ ot@@ ien@@ tes compared to the output level . &quot;
&quot; the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus plac@@ ebo ) was checked in a small , over 18 weeks out of the examination of type @-@ 2 di@@ ab@@ etics . &quot;
in most clinical trials were compared to plac@@ ebo a reduction of the total plas@@ ma tri@@ gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L@@ - cholesterol level as well as low @-@ level but clin@@ ically not significant increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol level .
clinical trials over a period of up to two years reduced Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on compared to plac@@ ebo , met@@ form@@ in or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de the total plastic gly@@ z@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased the HD@@ L cholesterol level . &quot;
&quot; compared to plac@@ ebo , under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on no statisti@@ cally significant increase in the L@@ DL cholesterol level , while under met@@ form@@ in and Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de decreased values were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study about 20 weeks of reduced pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , not only the so@@ ber tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de , but improved also the extrac@@ tive tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d@@ mirror , which has an effect on the Tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d absorption as well as the hep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the pro@@ active study , a cardiovascular out@@ come study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing mak@@ rov@@ ascular disease in groups random@@ ized , which received over a period of up to 3.5 years in addition to existing anti@@ di@@ ab@@ etic and cardiovascular therapy either Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; according to oral application Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on quickly res@@ or@@ bi@@ ert , whereby the top @-@ centralized pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one can usually be reached 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; based on this basis , the contribution from M @-@ IV to the effectiveness in roughly the triple the effectiveness of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in Inter@@ actions studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on has no relevant effect on Pharmac@@ ology or pharmaceutical dynamics of Dig@@ ox@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon , and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on with gem@@ fi@@ bro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8@@ - In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C8 In@@ du@@ ce ) or lo@@ wers the Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ation of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( see Section 4.5 ) .
after oral use of radio@@ active mark@@ eter pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on in the human being the mark@@ er was found mainly in the case ( 55 % ) and a lower degree in the har@@ n ( 45 % ) .
the middle plas@@ ma Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ ary period of un@@ change@@ able pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on amounts to people 5 @-@ 6 hours and all active Met@@ abol@@ ism is at 16 - 23 hours .
&quot; the plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on and its met@@ abol@@ ites are lower than in patients with reduced kidney function lower than with healthy proportions , whereas the fr@@ aming of the oral Clear@@ ance of the parent is similar . &quot;

this is due to that under treatment with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on the hyper@@ ins@@ ulin resistance and increased ins@@ ulin resistance of the parent and thereby reduces the availability of the metabo@@ lic sub@@ str@@ ate for the fat growth .

in another study over two years the effects of a combination of met@@ form@@ in combination with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on or Gli@@ cl@@ azi@@ de are examined .
in clinical studies about 1 year the pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on consistently showed a statisti@@ cally significant reduction in the album / credit quot@@ a compared to the output level .

&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane was used in total 29@@ 4 patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , in which the pancre@@ as can not produce ins@@ ulin , and type @-@ 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use the ins@@ ulin effectively . &quot;
the study was measured after 12 weeks the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) which shows how good the blood sugar is set .
&quot; Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane led to a capture of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c Spi@@ eg@@ els , which were pointed out that the blood sugar levels were similar much as with another human ins@@ ulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane should not be applied in patients that may be in@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to human@@ ins@@ ulin ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane may be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar ( the full list is included in the package position ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran out to conclude that the benefits of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane cr@@ ates the risks of diabetes against the risks .
October 2002 the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane throughout the European Union .

&quot; patients whose blood vessels can be significantly improved for example , through an intense ins@@ ulin therapy , can modify Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;

&quot; if the change to Ac@@ tr@@ aph@@ ane is required in the patient a dosage adjustment , this may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; some patients , in which hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions appeared after a change of animal in@@ humane to human ins@@ ulin , reported that the early war@@ nings symptoms of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia less pronounced or otherwise compared with their previous ins@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; traveling to travel through several periods , the patient should be advised to take care of the Council of his physician , as such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be used or taken at other times . &quot;
the doctor must therefore consider possible interactions in therapy and always consult his patients after another of them .

Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may not be used in patients which may be hyper@@ sensitive to ins@@ ulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or one of the other components .
&quot; moreover , the doses of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id may need to be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood sugar . &quot;
October 2002 the European Commission shared the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S a licence for the transport of Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id throughout the European Union .
&quot; when two types of ins@@ ulin will be mixed first , the amount of the rapidly acting in@@ ulin must be raised , then the quantity of the long acting in@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If the transition to Ac@@ tr@@ ap@@ id can be required in the patient with a dosage adjustment , this may be necessary during the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after conversion . &quot;
&quot; traveling to travel through several periods , the patient should be advised to take care of the Council of his physician , as such trips can lead to that ins@@ ulin and meals must be used or taken at other times . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients suffering that are already signs of cryst@@ all@@ ine deposits , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or g@@ ask@@ ets ( &quot; stones &quot; that is , bigger Ur@@ at@@ ec@@ om@@ inations , which can lead to yellow and bon@@ sa@@ ations ) . &quot;
if the ure@@ th@@ eses are still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ ite the dose can be increased at once daily 120 mg .
&quot; during the first treatment options , more and more g@@ ask@@ ets can occur , that is why patients must be held at least during the first six months under treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic further medicines . &quot;
&quot; the drug is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transpl@@ ant , as it was not investigated for these groups . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , at the 1 0@@ 72 patients took part , the efficacy of various Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) were compared to a plac@@ ebo ( head@@ medi@@ cam@@ ents ) and from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 762 patients each with Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
in both studies Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was applied in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems were only 100 mg per day .
the main indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the number of patients whose ure@@ th@@ ine pi@@ ps was in the blood for the last three measurements below 6 mg / dl .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 262 ) of patients , the Aden@@ ur@@ ic took one dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 of 269 ) of patients who once received daily 120 mg at least 120 mg at the blood of under 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was at 22 % ( 60 of 268 ) of patients suffering from Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in any of the 134 patients under plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea ( Nau@@ sea ) , rash , and ab@@ normal liver values . &quot;
&quot; in particular in patients with cardi@@ ac disease , it may also be a maneu@@ ver risk of certain side effects which concern the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran at the conclusion that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was effective in the blood of ur@@ inary tract , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and the blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of chronic hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia in diseases , which have already led to Ur@@ at@@ abl@@ ag@@ grad@@ ations ( including one of the medical history known or present these g@@ ask@@ h@@ ens and / or a G@@ ich@@ tar@@ ker ) . &quot;
if the ser@@ um har@@ vesting s@@ ails after 2 @-@ 4 weeks still is &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) can be considered a dosage increase on AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney disease , the effectiveness and safety were not fully examined ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ - Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
children and young people since children and young people are no experience in children and young people who are not recommended by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group .
&quot; organic tran@@ splan@@ ts have no experience at the organ of tran@@ splan@@ ts , the application of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases For patients with isch@@ a cardi@@ ac disease or de@@ compens@@ ate heart @-@ suff@@ iciency is not recommended for treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; as with other har@@ vesting medicines , it may occur during treatment start to a acute g@@ ask@@ ets , because by lowering the ser@@ um har@@ s@@ able pi@@ eg@@ els initially mobili@@ zed in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. at mal@@ ign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ syndrome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine have been so far ahead that it comes to a distr@@ acting in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
liver diseases Dur@@ ing the clinical studies of phase 3 have been observed ( 3.5 % ) in the clinical studies of the phase 3 were observed ( 3.5 % ) .
&quot; it is therefore recommended , prior to the beginning of Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ s and in further course depending on the clinical trial you can perform a liver functioning test ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
The@@ ophy@@ l@@ line has been carried out no exchange studies to Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O shirts can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ tic levels ( a inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ ati@@ zation of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line was also reported for other X@@ O @-@ Hem@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for pro@@ hibition was the simultaneous gift of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at and Nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x daily with an increase in Feb@@ ux@@ o@@ stat@@ ure ( C@@ max 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies the application of Nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not related to a clin@@ ically significant increase in unwanted events .

&quot; Ant@@ azi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of a ant@@ acid du@@ ms , the magnesium hydro@@ x@@ id and aluminum hydro@@ x@@ id ( around 1 hour ) delay and a decrease in the C@@ max around 32 % , but not a significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exp@@ oni@@ zed pregn@@ an@@ cies can not be close to side effects of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at for pregnancy or health of Fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful with the taxes of a vehicle , serving machines or in the exercise of hazardous activities until they may be less sure that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may not be detri@@ mental to their performance . &quot;
a numer@@ ical higher incidence of the test reported cardiovascular study was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.05 events per 100 patients years ) and in long @-@ term - extension studies ( 1.9 versus 0.05 events per 100 patient years ) and no statisti@@ cally significant differences could be observed with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at .
the risk factors in these patients were an arter@@ ial @-@ erotic disorder and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal colored or a de@@ compens@@ ated Her@@ bal suff@@ iciency in the health history .
&quot; frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( &gt; 1 / 1 / 100 ) and rare ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) side effects which were reported in the treatment with 80 mg / 120 mg @-@ treatment groups in total more than once , are listed below . &quot;
diar@@ rhe@@ a , nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are more common in patients who were treated simultaneously with Col@@ oni@@ ons . * * In clinical trials were not observed any severe rash or serious over@@ sensitivity reactions . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ene long @-@ term extension studies in the open long @-@ term renewal studies , 906 patients up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 3 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients treated up to 4 years with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the studies reported during the long @-@ term - extension @-@ related events were similar to which were reported in the studies of Phase 3 ( see table 1 ) .

clinical study results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was conducted in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ act study as described below ) that have been performed with 1.@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ uri@@ k@@ emia and gre@@ ets .
the primary active ingredient in every study was the proportion of patients in which the last three monthly res@@ ellers &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were .
&quot; plac@@ ebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 267 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 10 ) for patients with a Ser@@ um@@ kre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ worth to study program of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed in view of the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ hard @-@ s@@ ails under 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) ( see table 2 and figure 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conventional used cans Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 258 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .

the reduction of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ s@@ pi@@ eg@@ els on &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed in a week 2 and permanently maintained over the entire treatment .
5@@ 09 patients received Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with ser@@ cancer incre@@ ment &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl got 100 mg 1 x daily .
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney @-@ de@@ composition The AP@@ EX study evaluated the effectiveness of 40 patients with kidney functionality .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary active ingredient in 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences with regard to the percentage back of the Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ re@@ centr@@ ations in proportions , irrespective of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal kidney function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dys@@ functions ) . &quot;
primary end in the sub@@ group of patients with Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ re@@ centr@@ alised &gt; 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( AP@@ EX@@ - and F@@ act study ) had a Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ re@@ con@@ dens@@ ation of &gt; 10 mg / dl .
the data collected in two years collected data from the open extension study on &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) a decrease of the incidence of g@@ ask@@ an@@ cies revealed that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 drops a treatment against a G@@ ich@@ tsch@@ ub ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients required no treatment against a G@@ ich@@ tsch@@ ub ) .
&quot; this was also associated with a reduction of g@@ ask@@ eting size , which at 54 % of patients had a complete dis@@ appearance of g@@ ask@@ k@@ elling up to month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at ( 5.5 % ) in the open long @-@ term renewal studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
for healthy proportions increased the maximum Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centralized ( C@@ max ) and the surface at the Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ centralized time @-@ curve ( AU@@ C ) by Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at after administration &apos;s simple and multi@@ pl@@ ers doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg is observed for Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at a rise in AU@@ C , which is greater than the dos@@ is@@ proportion@@ ate rise . &quot;
after in@@ ges@@ tion easy or multi@@ pl@@ ers of 80 and 120 mg 1 x daily the C@@ max approximately 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.5 µ@@ g / ml .
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change has been observed in the percentage decline in Ser@@ um@@ har@@ n@@ s@@ äu@@ re@@ centr@@ ation , provided that this has been tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The seem@@ ing Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is located in the range from 29 to 75 l after intake of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
&quot; the plas@@ ma @-@ use of Feb@@ ux@@ ost@@ at is about 99@@ ,@@ 2 % ( primary bond to Alb@@ um@@ in ) and is about the concentr@@ ating width , which is reached with doses of 80 and 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat oste@@ opor@@ osis ( a disease , where the bones are used ) in women after men@@ opause , where a risk for a small vitamin D mirror exists . &quot;
&quot; the patient has to take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acid , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and Vit@@ amin@@ ants ) . &quot;
&quot; to avoid a irrit@@ ation of es@@ oph@@ agus , the patient may take up until after the first food intake of the day , the early 30 minutes after taking the tablet should not lie down . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at and vitamin D@@ 3 are already separated from each other in drugs that are approved in the European Union , the company put data from earlier studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study involving 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women with oste@@ opor@@ osis to em@@ ulate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing the vitamin D es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D mirror was treated with the patients who were treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than with those who took exclusively Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( 32 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the company also placed data in front of which data contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in the Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at dose , which is exactly the dose which is required for the prevention of a bone lu@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , pain of muscul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal apparatus ( path@@ ology ) , con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation , Di@@ ar@@ orrho@@ e ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , tum@@ ul@@ ence ( bl@@ age ) , sor@@ c@@ ence ( bl@@ age ) , sor@@ c@@ ence ( s@@ laugh@@ ter@@ ings ) , tag@@ ged abdom@@ en ( mo@@ wing abdom@@ en ) , as well as su@@ res . &quot;
&quot; in patients with et@@ ular hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Al@@ end@@ ron@@ age , vitamin D@@ 3 or any other components may not be used AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in diseases of the es@@ oph@@ agus , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand up at least 30 minutes or sit . &quot;
Janu@@ ary@@ 2007 , the European Commission shared the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ men Ltd . a licence for the in@@ scription of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; capsule , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a button on one side and &quot; 710 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , beverage or taking drugs ( including ant@@ acid , Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ - and vit@@ amine supplements ) for the day . &quot;
the following critics are exactly to be followed to reduce the risk of ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see Section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be helped by the day only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) . • The patients should not give up the tablet or the tablet in the mouth , as a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ ynge@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a . • The patients should not be carried out before the first food intake of the day , which is to take place 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tical Ul@@ kus , active gast@@ ro@@ dents in@@ ale hem@@ or@@ ations or surgical procedures in the upper Gast@@ ro@@ mb@@ in@@ al@@ tr@@ act except P@@ yl@@ or@@ oplast@@ y , can only be given in particular attention ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; econom@@ ists , such as Ö@@ soph@@ agi@@ tis , os@@ oph@@ age@@ al Ul@@ zer@@ a and ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al ero@@ ons , rarely followed by ös@@ oph@@ age@@ al Stri@@ pes , were reported in patients under the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at ( partly these severe and required an ambulance instruction ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore notice attentive to all signs and symptoms that are intended to point out to any signs and symptoms , which should be noted , while the occurrence of symptoms , or retro@@ ster@@ n@@ ale pain , or new or self @-@ mer@@ ing pain of so@@ d@@ burn and pick medical advice ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe os@@ oph@@ age@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients that the medicine is not correct and / or , after the appearance of symptoms that point to an e @-@ oph@@ age@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all the d@@ osing instructions are passed on to patients and to be understood by the patient ( see Section 4.2 ) .
&quot; during large @-@ made clinical studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at is no risk established , were rare ( after market launch ) gast@@ ric and Du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , including some severe and with complications , reports ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose des pine , usually reported in connection with a tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including oste@@ omy@@ eli@@ tis ) , was reported in cancer patients whose treatment ime was predominantly intraven@@ ous bis@@ phosph@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there is no data available to specify , whether the dis@@ set of a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ at@@ therapy in patients who need an kie@@ ffer surgical procedure , dimin@@ ished the risk of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose by the pine . &quot;
clinical assessment by the treating doctor is necessary for treatment planning in every patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instruc@@ ted that they should take their om@@ is@@ ance of taking a dose AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet at the next morning after having noticed her om@@ is@@ ance .
&quot; they are supposed to take no two tablets on the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on this week@@ day . &quot;
other diseases that affect the mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D @-@ lack and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ di@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated before the start of therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; indoor foods and beverages ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids , and some or@@ ale medicines can imp@@ air the res@@ or@@ ption of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at when they are taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients need to wait after the intake of Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at least 30 minutes before they take other medicines ( see sections 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interactions have not been conducted , Al@@ end@@ ron@@ ate was taken in clinical studies together with a variety of usually prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interaction effects . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for application in post@@ men@@ op@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not used either during pregnancy nor of nursing women .
animal studies with Al@@ end@@ ron@@ at leave no reference to directly compens@@ ating effects regarding pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post @-@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose from the j@@ aw was reported in patients under bis@@ phosph@@ ate , but most of the reports were reported by cancer victims , but was also reported on oste@@ opor@@ os@@ ep@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , deport@@ ations of the Ser@@ um @-@ Cal@@ ci@@ um up to &lt; 8,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 2,@@ 0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the Ser@@ um@@ - phosph@@ ate up to ≤ 2,@@ 0 mg / dl ( RA@@ m@@ mo@@ l / l ) in both treatment groups with similar frequency . &quot;

Adv@@ ag@@ raf is administ@@ ered adult patients which became a kidney or liver plan to prevent a de@@ vel of the tran@@ splan@@ tion of the tran@@ splan@@ tion by the immune system .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft and data from the published literature . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the results of a clinical trial were submitted to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transpl@@ ant , whereby the application of Adv@@ ag@@ raf is compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gr@@ aft or Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; main indi@@ cul@@ ator of the effectiveness was the number of patients , where the tran@@ splan@@ ts was collected after a treatment time by one year ( by example , for example , how often a renewed organic transpl@@ ant or a resum@@ ption of the di@@ aly@@ sis needed ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , more studies of 119 patients were carried out with kidney transpl@@ ant and 129 patients with liver transpl@@ ant surgery and exam@@ ines such as Adv@@ enti@@ raf in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / pro@@ gr@@ aft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients with et@@ ular hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , macro@@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any other components may not be applied . &quot;
patients and doctors have to be careful when others ( especially some herbal ) medicines should be taken simultaneously with Adv@@ ag@@ raf as the Adv@@ enti@@ raf dose or the dose of the at the same time must be adapted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transpl@@ ant patients should arrange this medicine or make changes in the immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences of the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , this can lead to tran@@ splan@@ ts or to an increased incidence of side effects , including lower or excess immun@@ isation . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transpl@@ ant medicine ( see sections 4.4 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; in a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dosage adjustment must be performed to ensure that the system@@ ic exposure of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us remain intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ ag@@ raf should be based primarily on the clinical evaluation of de@@ generation and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood @-@ mir@@ rors ( see below .
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley should be controlled before the conversion and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; day 4 was the system@@ ic exposure , measured as a valley level , with both form@@ ulations both at Ni@@ er@@ - and in living @-@ planning patients . &quot;
careful and repeti@@ tive checks of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ levels are recommended during the first two weeks after transpl@@ ant under Adv@@ ag@@ raf to ensure proper substance exposure in the immediate after@@ tran@@ splan@@ ts phase .
&quot; as Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us is a substance with low Clear@@ ance , can last a adaptation of the Adv@@ ent Dos@@ is@@ schem@@ as for several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient is not allowed in the first post @-@ operative phase of drugs , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us treatment of intraven@@ ous ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml of conc@@ entri@@ cular solution ) are initiated by a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; the duration of applying Z@@ ur repression of tran@@ splan@@ ts must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy can not be specified . &quot;
dosage recommendations - Ni@@ er@@ entr@@ an@@ spl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ splan@@ tion prophy@@ la@@ xis Acc@@ eler@@ ation The or@@ ale Adv@@ ant@@ raf therapy should start with 0.20 - 0,30 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning .
further Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations can be later required as the phar@@ a@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can change in the course of stabil@@ isation of the patient after transpl@@ antation .
dosage recommendations - liver transpl@@ ant prophy@@ la@@ xis of the tran@@ splan@@ tion prophy@@ la@@ xis should begin with 0.10 - 0.20 mg / kg / day as a day daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendations - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf must be a tran@@ spl@@ ave receiver of twice a daily intake of pro@@ gra@@ f capsules at once daily intake of Adv@@ ag@@ raf , so has this change in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the entire daily dose . &quot;

&quot; transpl@@ antation When adult patients , which are put on Adv@@ ant@@ raf , is an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day daily once in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other tran@@ splan@@ tion Receiver although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ oc@@ raf in pul@@ mon@@ ary , p@@ ank@@ atic - and the C@@ ectal sep@@ t@@ osis of patients in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 2 mg / kg / day and at intestinal tran@@ splan@@ ts in an oral initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / day for application . &quot;
dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function Z@@ ur maintenance of blood @-@ mirror in the increased area can be required in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions .
&quot; patients with reduced Ni@@ eren@@ function Da kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , it can be assumed that a dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic pot@@ enti@@ als of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , however , a careful monitoring of the kidney function ( including a regular determination of the ser@@ um@@ cre@@ at@@ ine level , a calculation of the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ incl@@ ear@@ ance and a monitoring of ur@@ inary volume ) . &quot;
switching from Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ ag@@ raf When switching from a Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in@@ - on a Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ based therapy is advisable ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
&quot; recommendations on the Tal@@ mirror in full blast the dose should be primarily based on the clinical evaluation of break@@ down and toler@@ ability in an individual case under the help of thorou@@ gh@@ bred Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us @-@ Tal@@ usion controls . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to perform frequent controls of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us valley levels during the first two weeks after transpl@@ antation , followed by peri@@ odi@@ cal controls during the issu@@ ing therapy . &quot;
&quot; blood @-@ valley of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us should also change after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ ag@@ raf , Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ able , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or for simultaneous application of substances that could change the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us full @-@ blood circulation ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ ag@@ raf is a medicine with a low Clear@@ ance , adapt@@ ations of the dose may need several days until the ste@@ ady state has entered . &quot;
the data in clinical trials can conclude that a successful treatment is possible in most cases when the Tal@@ mirror in the blood 20 n@@ g / ml does not exceed .
&quot; in clinical practice , the seb@@ asti@@ se of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us generally lie in the area of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and in nish - and sav@@ our@@ ated patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent income of liver therapy , kidney and cardi@@ ac tran@@ splan@@ ts have been used in general blood @-@ centralized in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; this led to serious unwanted events , including tran@@ splan@@ ts or other side effects , which can occur in a result of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us under@@ or over@@ lap . &quot;
patients should always keep the same Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us formulation and the corresponding daily dosage ; modification of the formulation or the regime should only be made under the narro@@ wer control of one in the transpl@@ ant medicine ( see sections 4.2 and 4.8 ) .
&quot; 5 z@@ ur treatment of adult patients with tran@@ splan@@ ts , proved to be proven against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants as a therap@@ ist , there are no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ oc@@ raf . &quot;
for prophy@@ la@@ xis of tran@@ splan@@ ts the tran@@ splan@@ tion at adult heart transpl@@ ant and tran@@ splan@@ ts are still no clinical data for the re@@ tar@@ ded formulation Adv@@ oc@@ raf .
&quot; because of possible interactions , which can lead to a descent of the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ b mirror in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us , the intake of herbal supplements ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) , or other plant remedies available during treatment with Adv@@ ag@@ raf ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea concentr@@ ates a particularly careful monitoring of the tactics in the blood , as the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us blood levels may be subject to such circumstances significant fluctu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , under Pro@@ gra@@ f was to observe a cardi@@ ac e@@ opathy or sep@@ tum hyper@@ trop@@ y , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ ag@@ raf . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical interference , are an already existing cardi@@ ac disease , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver dys@@ functions , infections , liquid over@@ load and eyel@@ et . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , the interaction of sunlight or UV @-@ light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign@@ ant skin changes through appropriate clothing or use of a solar protection through a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients , the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us are taking symptoms for P@@ RES such as head@@ aches , modified consciousness levels , cr@@ amping and visual dys@@ functions , should be a radi@@ ological investigation ( e.g. . &quot;

&quot; the simultaneous application of drugs or herbal medicinal products , which are known as Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , can increase the metabolism of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us and thus reduce the blood levels of Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us . &quot;
&quot; it is therefore recommended that Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ - blood flow at the simultaneous gift of substances , which can change the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A metabolism and to set the Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us dosage for the maintenance of more even@@ ly concentr@@ ations ( see sections 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;

Adv@@ ate is used for treatment and prevention of ble@@ eding in patients with com@@ ophi@@ lia A ( one by the lack of factor VIII @-@ related , inn@@ ate blood cl@@ ag@@ ation ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of application will then be applied to whether Adv@@ ata is applied to the treatment of ble@@ eding or the prevention of ble@@ eding in surgical procedures .
patients with com@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VIII deficiency that causes ble@@ eding problems such as ble@@ eding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extrac@@ ted from human plas@@ ma , but according to a method that is referred to as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology &quot; : &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell , produced by a cell , into which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which they are capable of creating the human scent factor VIII . &quot;
&quot; advoc@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but it is different , so that the drug does not contain proteins , or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the application of the drug is examined by means of prevention of ble@@ eding and in surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study the effectiveness of Adv@@ ate was awarded in the prevention of ble@@ eding in 86 % of 510 new blood@@ thir@@ ties with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; respectively . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Adv@@ ate ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess , head@@ aches , Py@@ re@@ xy ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies to factor VIII . &quot;
Adv@@ ate must not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against the human scent factor VIII , mouse or ham@@ ster or one of the other components . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission shared with B@@ ax@@ ter AG approved approval for the transport of Adv@@ ent in the entire European Union . &quot;
dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution therapy is based on the gravity of the factor VIII Man@@ gels , after the place and the extent of the blood and the clinical state of the patient . &quot;
in the following here@@ after @-@ mor@@ tal events the factor of VIII activities in the appropriate period is not to be found under the specified plas@@ mas@@ ons ( in % of the standard or in i.e. / dl ) .
injection all 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer repeat until the pain and the acute impair@@ ment are eliminated .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) repe@@ ating the danger to the patient .
during treatment session it is used to control the dosage and frequency of inj@@ ections an appropriate determination of the factor VIII @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ons .
individual patients may differ in their reaction to factor VIII different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different semi @-@ value times .
3 prophy@@ la@@ xis Z@@ ur long @-@ term prophy@@ la@@ xis of patients with severe h@@ amm@@ ophi@@ lia A are to be doses between 20 and 40 i.e. from factor VIII per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VIII @-@ plas@@ ma work can not be achieved , or when the blood circulation is not controlled with a reasonable dose , a test must be performed if necessary to detect a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ical values , it is possible that the factor VIII therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic interventions must be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; the speed of speed is to be directed after the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alised antibodies ( In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors ) against factor VIII is a known compens@@ atory in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors are always against the pro@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ational activity of factor VIII and Ig@@ G immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins that are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plas@@ ma by means of modi@@ fying Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk to develop inhibit@@ ors , cor@@ related to the extent of exposure to the factor VIII , whereby the risk within the first 20 ex@@ position days is the biggest and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 ex@@ position and an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ t@@ cy @-@ known in@@ hi@@ bit@@ or@@ ical development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VIII product to another , the re@@ formation of ( lower tri@@ llion ) in@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;

&quot; the patients in the greatest number of patients were In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors against factor VIII ( 5 patients ) , which all had previously untreated patients to have a higher risk to the formation of inhibit@@ ors , head@@ aches ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ z@@ zin@@ ess ( each 3 patients ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; &gt; 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is not known ( frequency on the basis of available data . &quot;

the blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained during the whole time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - mirror in the plas@@ ma and the Clear@@ ance rate showed sufficient values on the 15th post@@ operative day .

&quot; based on the data available , the CH@@ MP has been valued as positive as positive as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;

December 2008 Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ec@@ ular Limited has been officially attributed to the Committee on Human@@ itarian Lec@@ tures ( CH@@ MP ) that the company takes its request for approval for the In@@ struction for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer .

&quot; this is a type of virus that , gene@@ tically modified , it is a gene capable of wearing the cells of the body . &quot;
&quot; when the virus in Adv@@ exin is a &quot; &quot; aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; &quot; that has changed so that there can be no copies of yourself and thus no infections can trigger . &quot;
Adv@@ exin should have been swe@@ et@@ ched directly into the tum@@ ors and thus allow the cancer cells to form the normal p@@ 53 @-@ protein .
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein which is formed from which not def@@ ective in the human body existing p@@ 53 gene is normally formed to restore damaged DNA , and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be restored . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is def@@ ective , the p@@ 53 @-@ protein does not work properly , and the canc@@ erous cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company laid data from a study with a patient , with the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the sub@@ tree , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; once the CH@@ MP had checked the answers of the company on the questions asked , still some questions were uns@@ ol@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; based on the inspection of the initial submitted documents , the CH@@ MP is made on day 120 a list of questions that will be sent to the company . &quot;
after the CH@@ MP opinion it was not sufficiently demonstrated that inj@@ ecting from Adv@@ exin in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i @-@ Tum@@ ore benefits for patients .
&quot; the committee also had concerns regarding the processing of drug use in the body , the type of administration , as well as the safety of medicine . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently proven that Adv@@ exin can be made in reliable way and that there is neither for the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company does not endor@@ se the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal consequences for patients who are currently taking part in clinical trials or &quot; Comp@@ as@@ sion@@ ate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ exin .
changing active drug use &quot; means that the tablets are so assembled that one of the effective components immediately and the other slow to be released over a few hours .
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used for treating the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( ha@@ yst@@ ro@@ up@@ fen , through an allergy to poll@@ en the nose @-@ paths of the nose @-@ paths ) in patients with nas@@ al @-@ skin swelling ( pet@@ ri@@ fter nose ) . &quot;
&quot; for adults and young people aged 12 years , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a tablet that should be taken up with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of treatment should be as short as possible and ended as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nose sc@@ alp ( hidden nose ) , abbrevi@@ ations are . &quot;
a treatment of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be found by means of con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose .
the main @-@ effective dimensions were the changes of the sever@@ ity of the ha@@ sten@@ osis symptoms that reported from patients before the start of treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study patients were carried out their symptoms all 12 hours into a journal , and evaluated with a standard sk@@ ala , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; considering all the ha@@ iry of the nose symptoms except the con@@ sti@@ p@@ ation of the nose reported the patients , the aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , were compared to 35,@@ 9 % in the patient , the pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine alone . &quot;
&quot; when only the swelling of the nose sc@@ ary was seen , patients below aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed an all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms around 3@@ 7,@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients who received Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( cardi@@ ac disease ) , schi@@ z@@ ex@@ ia ( Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ lessness ) , conc@@ essions , fatigue , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , in@@ som@@ nia and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may in case of patients suffering , which may possibly be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine or one of the other components , against in@@ ep@@ tive active ingredients or Lor@@ at@@ adin ( another medicine for the treatment of allergi@@ es ) are not applied . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may also not be applied in patients suffering from hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ osis ( hyper@@ tension caused by a brain &apos;s stroke ) or have a risk for an ugly stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission shared the SP Europe a permit for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , however , is to sw@@ allow for the whole ( that is , without it , to break or ch@@ ew ) . &quot;
Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should be applied due to the lack of data on im@@ measurable and effectiveness ( see Section 5.1 ) for children under 12 years of age .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after de@@ sound the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application duration of 10 days , as long @-@ term application can decrease the activity of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine at time . &quot;
&quot; after decrease in the swelling of the vei@@ ls in the upper respir@@ atory , the treatment can be continued when needed with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin as a mon@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; since aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine contains , the drug also deals with patients who are treated with a mon@@ o@@ amine oxid@@ ation ( MA@@ O ) or within 2 weeks after the ter@@ mination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attri@@ but@@ able to the al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combination of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine like Bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , Lis@@ ur@@ id , Cab@@ erg@@ olin , Er@@ got@@ amine , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other dec@@ on@@ ges@@ tive Rhin@@ ology , eph@@ edr@@ ine , Ox@@ y@@ met@@ ac@@ olin , Nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and effectiveness of this combination therapy were not tested for this patient care and the data are not enough to express corresponding recommendations for dosage .
safety and effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver interference and the data are not enough to express corresponding recommendations for dosage .
&quot; patients need to be informed about the treatment in appearance of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st , or from Pal@@ ash@@ cations , cardi@@ ac disorders , nau@@ sea or any other neurological symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or strengthening of head@@ ache ) . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of following patient groups , patients under Digital@@ is • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with cardi@@ ac disease • patients with cardi@@ ac disease in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in the An@@ am@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze has at least 48 hours before implementing dermat@@ ological tests , as anti@@ hist@@ amine can prevent positive reactions on indicators for front actions or reduce in their extent . &quot;
&quot; in the framework of clinical trials with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , where ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition were administ@@ ered , however no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plas@@ ma cent@@ ric of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or tests , no significant differences between those with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and those with plac@@ ebo untreated patients were determined , regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin alone or with alcohol was taken . &quot;
this for the met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin responsible enzy@@ mes was not yet identified so that interactions with other drugs cannot be ruled out completely .
&quot; Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 did not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an in@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ Gl@@ y@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; the infin@@ ity of the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not guaranteed , experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ an@@ cies however does not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency of normal population . &quot;
&quot; as reproduction studies on animals are not always transferred to human beings , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ al properties of Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine should not be applied in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be clari@@ fied that in very rare cases it may come to a ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a Z@@ NS depression ( Se@@ al , Ap@@ nea , coma , coma , cardiovascular coll@@ aps ) and a Z@@ NS stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with potential let@@ ter@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; head@@ aches , anxiety , start@@ ups Mik@@ tion , muscle weakness , and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st , pal@@ ates , transpl@@ ant , t@@ agli@@ der , t@@ agli@@ der , Tinnitus , at@@ ax@@ ie , visual disorders and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a Z@@ NS stimulation is especially likely , as well as A@@ tropical in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , p@@ up@@ iter star@@ re and - di@@ lat@@ ation , door@@ ways , hyper@@ ther@@ mia , and gast@@ ro@@ vi@@ in@@ ale symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the inhi@@ bit of the release of pro@@ lled cy@@ to@@ c@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human cor@@ st@@ ons / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhi@@ bit of expression of the Ad@@ hä@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ per cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening subjective battles or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
in controlled clinical trials were found in recommended dosage of 5 mg daily no increased frequency of slip compared to plac@@ ebo .
&quot; the or@@ ale application of pseudo @-@ eph@@ edr@@ ine in the recommended dosage can generate additional li@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , a t@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ ate or manifestations of a Z@@ NS arousal . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 248 patients aged between 12 and 78 years with seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis , with 4@@ 14 patients Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined on the basis of the overall cor@@ es for symptoms ( except nose @-@ skin swelling ) , significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ edr@@ ine over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the fluctu@@ ating effect , determined by the nose @-@ swe@@ eping effect , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us has been studied in total eight studies with approximately 4 800 adults and young people with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including four studies in seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis and two studies in patients who also had as@@ thma ) .
&quot; the effectiveness has been measured by changing the symptoms ( Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , number and size of the square , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on the day ) before and after six weeks . &quot;
&quot; further studies were submitted to em@@ ulate that the body is the sy@@ rup , the solution to the one and the mel@@ ting tablets in the same way , as the tablets and the application of children are harmless . &quot;
&quot; in allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , when the results of all studies have been addressed , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg ap@@ eri@@ us to an average withdrawal of symptoms ( symptoms ) at 25 to 32 % , compared to the reduction of 12 to 26 % in patients who received a plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in the two studies at Ur@@ tik@@ aria was the decrease of symptoms after six @-@ week treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % compared to 40 and 33 % compared to plac@@ ebo patients .
A@@ eri@@ us should not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , Lor@@ at@@ adin or one of the other components . &quot;
January 2001 shared the European Commission of SP Europe a permit for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us in the entire European Union .

there are limited experience of clinical trials for effectiveness in the application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin for young people from 12 to 17 years ( see sections 4.8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of inter@@ acting allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease process and can termin@@ ate after the end of the symptoms and with their re@@ ap occur .
in the Persian rhin@@ i@@ tis ( appearance of the symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found within the framework of clinical studies with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition were administ@@ ered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced at simultaneous intake of cy@@ eri@@ us and alcohol the high @-@ performance effects of alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) .
&quot; however , patients should be resolved in very rare cases that it may take in very rare cases , which can lead to a impair@@ ment of traffic or ability to serve machines . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently asked side effects , about the more common than plac@@ ebo was reported , fatigue ( 1.2 % ) , mouth @-@ dry ( 0,8 % ) and head@@ aches ( 0,@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with 578 y@@ outh@@ ful patients from 12 to 17 years , was the most common conc@@ essions head@@ aches , which were treated at 5.5 % of patients who were treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and were treated with 6,@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ level test , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the inhi@@ bit of the release of pro@@ lled cy@@ to@@ c@@ ines like IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human cor@@ st@@ ons / bas@@ ophil@@ es , as well as the inhi@@ bit of expression of the Ad@@ hä@@ sion@@ sm@@ ol@@ ec@@ ls P @-@ Sel@@ ec@@ tin on end@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ al@@ cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple sclerosis , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) over ten days has been administ@@ ered , no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dos@@ is@@ - study with adult , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement sizes , including the strengthening subjective battles or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , dirt and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , can be an allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis depending on the duration of the symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ acting allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and Persian allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
pers@@ ist allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis is defined as the appearance of symptoms of 4 or more days a week and more than 4 weeks .
&quot; as described by the overall cor@@ es of the frag@@ rant on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Eth@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively caused the allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis caused by seasonal rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria was analyzed for further forms of urine aria , since the underlying path@@ ological ge@@ ology irrespective of the Equ@@ ti@@ ology is similar to the different forms , and chronic patients may be simpler to prosp@@ ectively . &quot;
&quot; since the hist@@ amine release is an urs@@ ory factor in all ur@@ tics disorders , is expected that Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin will also result in the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria as well as in other forms of the prim@@ acy to an improvement of symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic m@@ eric , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of size and number of squares at the end of the first Dos@@ age . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with Anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka , the minority of patients , the minority of patients who are not on anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka re@@ ag@@ ated , out of the study . &quot;
an improvement of the itch to more than 50 % was observed at 55 % of the patients treated with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin patients compared to 19 % of patients with plac@@ ebo patients .
&quot; the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the disorder of the sleep and wax , as it was measured by a 4 @-@ point scale to evaluate this variables . &quot;
&quot; in a Pharmac@@ ology study , which were comparable to patients with the general seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis population , was achieved in 4 % of the patient a higher concentration of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant g@@ ulation for one particular application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days before .
&quot; however , the enzy@@ mes for the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has not yet been identified , so interactions with other medicines will not be entirely ruled out . &quot;
Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin inhibit@@ ors in @-@ vi@@ vo not CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vit@@ ro studies have shown that the drug CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 did not inhi@@ bit and neither a sub@@ str@@ ate nor an In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or of the P @-@ Gl@@ y@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins .
in a single dos@@ is@@ Study with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 7.5 mg more meals ( fatty , low @-@ cal@@ orie breakfast ) not to the availability of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; the clinical trials carried out with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin , in a compar@@ ative degree of exposure of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin , no qualitative or quantitative differences with regard to the tox@@ icity of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin and Lor@@ at@@ adin . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies to safety sp@@ ology , tox@@ icity in repeti@@ tive g@@ abe , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity and to Re@@ production of production , the pre@@ clinical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be seen no special dangers for humans . &quot;

A@@ eri@@ us can be taken independently of the meals to all@@ evi@@ ation the symptoms of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ( including inter@@ fer@@ rous and Persian allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis ) and Ur@@ tik@@ aria ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
the prescription doctor should be aware that most cases of Rhin@@ i@@ tis is to be caused by infection under 2 years ( see under Section 4.4 ) and that no data are subject to support the treatment of infectious rhin@@ i@@ tis with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respir@@ atory infections or anatom@@ ical an@@ om@@ alies should play a role in diagnosis , an@@ am@@ n@@ ese , physical investigations and corresponding laboratories and skin exam@@ inations . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years metabo@@ lic Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin are limited and experienced a higher output load ( see below paragraph 5.2 ) .
&quot; the security of A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups in children between 2 and 11 years , which is limited to metabo@@ lic metabo@@ lic , is identical with the children that is normally metabo@@ li@@ zed . &quot;

clin@@ ically relevant interaction were not found within the framework of clinical studies with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in addition were administ@@ ered ( see under Section 5.1 ) .
in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study was not reinforced at simultaneous intake of A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol the high @-@ performance effects of alcohol ( see under section 5.1 ) .
the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us Sir@@ ups Group similar to the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; clinical trials with adults and young people in various indications , including allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and chronic idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose 3 % more side effects in patients with A@@ eri@@ us as in patients who were treated with plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ level study on adults and young people , administ@@ ered up to 45 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( nin@@ ety clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children between the ages of 1 and 11 years entered into question a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ind@@ osis of 1.25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the process of allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis / chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic Ur@@ tik@@ aria and the profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin can be similar in adults and children , can be the active data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in adults on the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin used in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a clin@@ ically pharmac@@ ological study of adults and young people , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin in a dosage of 45 mg daily ( the Ne@@ un@@ fold of clinical dose ) was applied over ten days in adults , no renewal of the Q@@ T@@ c interval showed itself . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and young people no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
in a single @-@ day dose of 7.5 mg resulted in adults and young people in clinical trials to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or .
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , it came neither to the simultaneous intake of alcohol neither to a strengthening of alcohol in@@ duced activity nor to increase the slo@@ wn@@ iness . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nose secre@@ tion and ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , rejo@@ icing and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; as described by the overall cor@@ es of the frag@@ rant on the quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ Eth@@ ti@@ vi@@ tis , dimin@@ ishing A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively the caused by seasonal allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis . &quot;
&quot; in two plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic m@@ eric , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the descent of size and number of squares at the end of the first Dos@@ age . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited metabo@@ lic phen@@ otype was comparable in adults ( 6 % ) and children between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % adults , 16 % children ) than with merchants ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ up@@ set of children between 2 and 11 years with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , which are restricted . &quot;
&quot; the burden ( AU@@ C ) through Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin was approximately 3 to 6 hours , approximately 6@@ mal higher and the C@@ max . 3 to 4@@ times higher with a tempor@@ al half @-@ time period of approximately 120 hours . &quot;
there are no cl@@ ue to a clin@@ ically relevant active ingredient for one particular application of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and young people .

&quot; as part of a clinical trial with multiple sclerosis , in the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin has been applied in a dosage of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect has been described . &quot;
&quot; in a 30 single @-@ dose study with adults , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin 5 mg showed no influence on standard - measurement sizes , including the strengthening subjective battles or the tasks that are connected to the fly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in all@@ evi@@ ation of symptoms such as Ni@@ esen , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z of the nose , Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z , dirt and redness of the eyes as well as Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z on the pal@@ ate . &quot;

the overall prevalence of side effects in children between 2 and 11 years was similar to the Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin Group like the plac@@ ebo group .
&quot; in small children between 6 and 23 months the most common side effects were reported more often than plac@@ ebo , di@@ ar@@ orrho@@ e ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,@@ 3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study conducted in an additional study of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin solution , no side @-@ effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years have been observed . &quot;
for the recommended doses were the plas@@ ma @-@ cent@@ ric of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adin ( see below paragraph 5.2 ) in the children &apos;s and adul@@ thood population .
&quot; in controlled clinical studies , in the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and young people no increased frequency of sle@@ ep@@ iness compared to plac@@ ebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in sa@@ is@@ onal and per@@ enni@@ al , can be allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis depending on the duration of the symptoms , alternatively in inter@@ acting allergic rhin@@ i@@ tis and &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially launched the Committee on Human@@ itarian Psychology ( CH@@ MP ) officially launched by A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to the prevention of avi@@ ary H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 @-@ In@@ flu@@ enza in adults and older people .
&quot; A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be applied in adults and older people for the protection against flu , which is caused by the tribe ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influ@@ enza A virus . &quot;
&quot; this is a special kind of vaccine that might cause a strain of the flu , which might cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a Gri@@ pp@@ ep@@ an@@ dem@@ ie breaks out when a new tribe of the Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus emerg@@ es , which can easily spread from man to man because humans have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after administration of the vaccine recognis@@ es the immune system contained in the vaccine referred to as &quot; &quot; body @-@ foreign &quot; &quot; and forms si@@ RNA against it . &quot;
this is the immune system later in the position to form a contact with a Gri@@ p@@ pe@@ virus this pedi@@ gree .
&quot; subsequently , the membran@@ es of the virus with the &quot; &quot; surface areas &quot; &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which recogni@@ zes the human body as body @-@ foreign ) separated , and used as an integral part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection some of the study results showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; thus , the extent of the clinical data base for evaluating the vaccine for the safety of the vaccine is not to be fulfilled in order to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA guidelines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vaccines . &quot;
&quot; if you need to participate in a clinical examination and need more information about your treatment , please contact your treating doctor . &quot;
&quot; for further information regarding the recommendations of CH@@ MP , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is applied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines for the treatment of adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human@@ ic immune weak@@ evi@@ rus from type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which is caused by the wor@@ quired Imm@@ une De@@ fic@@ iency Syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot sw@@ allow the capsules , is in general as a solution for inclusion , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r since the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed if the doctor has checked , which anti @-@ viral medicines has been taken before , and the lik@@ eli@@ hood is that the virus is tou@@ ching the drug . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg k@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of A@@ gener@@ ase is aimed at body weight . &quot;
A@@ generic is reduced in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines the HIV amount in blood and keeps them at a low level .
&quot; AIDS does not heal , however , may delay the immune system and thus also delay the development of associated infections and disorders . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV infected adults , which previously did not have been treated with prot@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; this compared with low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r , reinforced medicine A@@ generic , was compared with 206 adults who had formerly prototype with other protein numbers . &quot;
main indi@@ c@@ ator for effectiveness was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable concentr@@ ations of HIV in the blood ( Vir@@ us@@ last ) or the change in Vir@@ us@@ last after treatment .
&quot; in the studies with patients who had previously taken no protein pre@@ valent among 400 copies / ml than in plac@@ ebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , A@@ gener@@ ase also decreased the viral last , however , were treated by the children who had previously been treated with prototype numbers , only very few on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults , which had previously been treated with Prot@@ eas@@ ants , lo@@ wered the Vir@@ us@@ last for 16 @-@ week treatment as effective as other prot@@ ections : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other proteins , it came under A@@ gener@@ ase together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to a stronger waste of Vir@@ us@@ last after four weeks as with the patients who received their previous prototype . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of A@@ gener@@ ase ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , nau@@ sea ( nau@@ sea ) , v@@ om@@ iting , rash and Fati@@ gue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ generic ase must not be applied in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r or one of the other components .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase may also not be applied in patients , the cur@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( a herbal medication used for treating depression ) or medicines that are just as pos@@ ase and are detri@@ mental to high concentr@@ ations in the blood health . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients suffering , the risk of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , one oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( symptoms of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syn@@ dro@@ ms ( symptoms of an infection , which are caused by changing immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran out to conclude that the advantages of A@@ generic drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years compared to the risks .
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier , but the committee established that the benefit of A@@ gener@@ ase in combination with k@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who have previously taken no prototype . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was originally approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; as at the time the approval for scientific reasons are limited only limited information . &quot;
&quot; October 2000 , the European Commission shared the G@@ lax@@ o Group Limited as a licence for the in@@ scription of as@@ et@@ ase in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1@@ - infected , prototype ( PI ) -@@ treated adults and children from 4 years . &quot;
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules are to be administ@@ ered for pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sting from Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see sections 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r should be considered in consideration of the individual viral Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ mu@@ sters and the pre @-@ line treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the entry is 14 % less than by Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram of a milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ void capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ stery ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ al@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the Pharmac@@ ology , efficacy and safety of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prototype numbers were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years , due to the failure of data on im@@ measurable and effectiveness ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dosage should be reduced to A@@ generic capsules with adult patients with moderate liver interference on 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dys@@ functions to 300 mg twice a day . &quot;
simultaneous application is to be carried out with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver interference with caution in patients with severe liver interference ( see Section 4.3 ) .
A@@ gener@@ ase must not be given simultaneously with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ en@@ cyclop@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
herbal supplements containing Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) must not be applied due to the risk of reduced Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ric and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r during the intake of Am@@ al@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.5 ) .
patients should be noted that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent the risk of transferring HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination with blood .
&quot; usually , A@@ generic capsules are to be applied together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , have a maneu@@ ver risk to serious liver effects associated with potentially deadly potential . &quot;
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis are showing an increased frequency of liver dysfunction under an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous application of A@@ generic and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ tic@@ as@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ ders that changes over CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the possible benefit of the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tico @-@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus Cus@@ depen@@ ded and Supp@@ lies of the adren@@ al function function ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; as the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin is strongly dependent on CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , will not be recommended for simultaneous administration of as@@ opath@@ ies with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in patients who take this medicine at the same time , A@@ gener@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased plastic cross@@ ings of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r less effective ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabo@@ lic interactions with am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormonal contrac@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a can be changed , but the information is not sufficient to estimate the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ on is given at the same time with Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , particularly if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; because of the possible risk of risk of tox@@ icity , due to the high prop@@ ylene gly@@ col@@ d@@ war@@ ts of the A@@ general solution to initi@@ ates this Dar@@ reich@@ ungs@@ form in children under an age of four years , and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
A@@ generic ase should be set on duration 5 when a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms . ( see Section 4.8 ) .
&quot; in patients who received an anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ections , was reported about the appearance of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing Diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
many of the patients had other diseases to be associated with their therapy medicines that are associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabo@@ lic disorders associated with it . &quot;
&quot; at h@@ amm@@ ophil@@ es patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ections , there are reports of an increase of ble@@ eding including spontaneous k@@ ut@@ aner hem@@ at@@ oms and her@@ mar@@ thro@@ es . &quot;
&quot; at HIV infected patients with severe immun@@ isation therapy , at the time of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections that leads to severe clinical conditions or deterioration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although a multi@@ fact@@ orial Equ@@ ti@@ ology is accepted ( including the use of cor@@ tico @-@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , higher Body @-@ Mass Index ) , cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase must not simultaneously be combined with drugs that have a low therapeutic width and also represent sub@@ str@@ ate of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ y@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ sub@@ str@@ ate with low therapeutic width A@@ gener@@ ase is not allowed to be combined together with drugs whose active ingredients are mainly associated with CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to increased plastic cross@@ roads with severe and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C is caused by Am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a residential development .
&quot; with the attempt , the lower plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ps caused by a dosage increase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , were very frequently observed unwanted effects on the liver . &quot;
Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) The Ser@@ um@@ mirror of Am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r can be hum@@ ili@@ ated by the simultaneous application of vegetable preparations ( hyper@@ ic@@ um per@@ for@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient takes already Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut , the amalg@@ am mirror , and , if possible , to review the Vir@@ us@@ last and the Johann@@ is@@ kr@@ aut . &quot;
a dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered along with am@@ an@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz below ) .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
clinical studies have been applied by 600 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily which occupy the effectiveness and infin@@ ity of this treatment schem@@ atics .
52 % lower when Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were obtained during the combination of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg k@@ avi@@ r ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a closer monitoring since the effectiveness and imm@@ uni@@ formity of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; there was no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study conducted in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in combination with di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , however , is recommended due to the anta@@ zi@@ dis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , that the revenues of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gener@@ ase are at least one hour apart ( see Ant@@ azi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore at gift of E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) No dosage adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ os@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ esters were low .
the effect of ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ in on other prot@@ ections and existing limited data can susp@@ ect that Ne@@ vir@@ ap@@ into the Ser@@ um@@ con@@ cent@@ ation of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r may lo@@ wers .
&quot; if these medicines should be used simultaneously , caution is advisable because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is less effective because of the decreased / or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plas@@ mas@@ ons less effective . &quot;
&quot; when these medicines are being applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous gift of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r and Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to a rise in the plas@@ tic@@ on@@ cent@@ ation ( AU@@ C ) by ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 193 % and thus to a rise in the side effects associated with cast@@ ed side effects .
&quot; if there is a clinical reasons required , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase is needed to reduce the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose , although there is no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ euticals in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not conducted , however , the plas@@ mas@@ on of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous application of twice a day 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily led to an increase in the C@@ max of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol in Plas@@ ma by 25 % and AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ down ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ v once daily without simultaneous application of Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines that are listed below , including sub@@ str@@ ates , Hem@@ mer or in@@ duc@@ tors of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , if they are being applied together with A@@ gener@@ ase , possibly to interactions . &quot;
&quot; patients should therefore be used on tox@@ icity , which are associated with these medicines , if they are used in combination with A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ections , it is advisable that Ant@@ azi@@ da cannot be taken at the same time as A@@ gener@@ ase as it can occur to res@@ or@@ atory disorders . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of anti@@ conv@@ ul@@ si@@ va , known as enzy@@ mes ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , Phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in ) , with am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r can lead to a hum@@ ili@@ ation of the plas@@ mas@@ quer@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of Cal@@ ci@@ um@@ can@@ al@@ ments such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , kidney pin , ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@ cot@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , causing possibly the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous intake with A@@ generic , their plas@@ ma @-@ cent@@ ric can considerably increase and reinforce with PD@@ E@@ 5 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors in connection with side effects including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disorders and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flight pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ wed cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % mixed intervals : 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; consequently , the simultaneous gift of A@@ gener@@ ase is not recommended with these gl@@ os@@ cor@@ tical oids , unless that the possible benefits of treatment is the risk of system@@ ic cor@@ tical @-@ ster@@ oid effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; at H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ vast@@ atin , their anch@@ oring strongly from CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is dependent , are distinctive enh@@ ances of the plas@@ mas@@ quer@@ ors to expect at simultaneous administration of A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ on@@ ings of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors to My@@ opathy , including a R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined application of these medicines will not be recommended with am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to be a frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentr@@ ations to stabil@@ ise the mirror , as the plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , Rap@@ un@@ y@@ cin and Tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us can be increased by simultaneous g@@ abe of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ gener@@ ase may not be used together with oral co @-@ recorded Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see Section 4.3 ) , while in simultaneous use of A@@ gener@@ ase with par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other proteins em@@ bit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ o from Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am to get the 3 to 4 @-@ fold .
&quot; if Meth@@ ad@@ on is administ@@ ered along with Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored on ob@@ pi@@ at@@ ent@@ ment symptoms , particularly if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced low distor@@ tion of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation is given no recommendation as the amalg@@ am@@ avi@@ r@@ - dose is when Am@@ af@@ avi@@ r is administ@@ ered at the same time with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormonal contr@@ az@@ ep@@ tiv@@ a is not fores@@ ee@@ able , therefore alternative methods for receptions is recommended . &quot;
a careful monitoring of therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants ( for example D@@ esi@@ pr@@ amine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended in simultaneous g@@ abe of A@@ gener@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
this medication may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful dis@@ rup@@ tions of the potential utility for the mother compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us .
&quot; in the milk activ@@ ating rats , Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances were detected , but it is not known whether Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r is over for people into the mother &apos;s milk . &quot;
&quot; a Re@@ production study of impair@@ ment , which was administ@@ ered by the objection in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in 12 body weight . &quot;
the further development of the ann@@ u@@ ity including Fer@@ til@@ arity and Re@@ production capacity was not affected by the administration of Am@@ al@@ avi@@ r on the mother@@ tier .
the in@@ adequ@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most related effects associated with the A@@ generic @-@ treatment side effects were slightly up to moderate , shown early and rarely resulted in treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clari@@ fied if they are in connection with the intake of aspir@@ ants or any other at the same time for HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the below side effects are made of two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) in which with protein numbers not previously received patients 1200 mg of cancer twice a day . &quot;
&quot; events ( degrees 2 to 4 ) , evaluated by the investig@@ ator as in connection with the study media , and in more than 1 % of patients were performed , as well as under the treatment rel@@ ent@@ ative laboratory changes ( degree 3 to 4 ) are listed . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy has been associated with a re@@ distribution of the body fat ( Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) with HIV patients , including a loss of periph@@ ery and fast @-@ fat fatty tissue , multip@@ lied in@@ tra@@ ab@@ domin@@ ance and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissues , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ zer@@ vi@@ k@@ aler fat collection ( Sti@@ ern@@ acken ) . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ y , not pre @-@ treated persons who were treated with Am@@ org@@ avi@@ r in combination with L@@ ami@@ v@@ ud@@ in / Zi@@ dov@@ ud@@ in over a middle duration of 36 weeks , was only observed ( boot ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 occurred at 245 NR@@ TI@@ ONS 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) for 241 patients suffering from in@@ din@@ avi@@ r in combination with different NR@@ TI@@ s about a medium duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) .
&quot; colored rash usually were slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or mak@@ ul@@ op@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without Ju@@ ck@@ rei@@ z and occurred spont@@ aneously during the second treatment week and disappeared spont@@ aneously within two weeks without having to be broken treatment with am@@ ot@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
cases of oste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose especially in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV disease or long @-@ term application of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; at HIV infected patients with severe immun@@ isation therapy , at the time of an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop a inflammatory reaction to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or resi@@ dual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both at acute and chron@@ ically in@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) , as well as in periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M when ak@@ ut infected cells and amounts to chronic µ@@ M in chronic cells .
the connection between the activity of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vit@@ ro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
in the treatment of retro@@ retro@@ sp@@ ective patients with the currently approved Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ dos@@ ages have been observed - like with other k@@ on@@ avi@@ r tr@@ oo@@ ster@@ ols - as described in other k@@ on@@ avi@@ r tr@@ ail@@ ors - the described mut@@ ations rarely observed .
&quot; for six@@ teen of 434 anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ ell@@ avi@@ r , with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 732 , entered a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure to week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ate gen@@ otyp@@ ical . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the insul@@ ate of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure have not been closed within the 59 , with prot@@ otyp@@ ing numbers , showed Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ mu@@ ster which were similar to those with adults . &quot;

in the study AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : N = 107 ) in patients with vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure than 96 weeks , the following prototype mut@@ ations : &quot;
on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance @-@ based analysis Gen@@ otyp@@ ical inter@@ pret@@ ations can be applied to the estim@@ ation of the activity of Am@@ al@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prototype @-@ resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 @-@ algorith@@ m for Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ A / L / V , I@@ 62@@ A / L / V / G , I@@ 54@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in connection with an increased phenomen@@ al resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as well as a decreased probability of a vi@@ rolog@@ ical response ( Resi@@ st@@ enz ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions concerning the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation@@ sm@@ ents can be subject to changes due to additional data , and it is recommended to always draw the current inter@@ pret@@ ations systems for the analysis of the results of Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ tests . &quot;
on phenomen@@ al resistance @-@ based analyses clin@@ ically vali@@ dation phenomen@@ al inter@@ pret@@ ations can be used in conjunction with the gen@@ otyp@@ ical data on the estim@@ ating of the activity of Am@@ al@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prototype @-@ resistant isolation .
&quot; companies , diagnostic resistance tests , have developed clin@@ ically @-@ ph@@ än@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ off@@ s ( divi@@ ding points ) for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be applied to the interpretation of results of a Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to Am@@ at@@ avi@@ r associ@@ ative patterns creates a certain Crus@@ ade against k@@ av@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , Nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains in general . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data for cross @-@ resistant between Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ections , for all 4 Fos@@ amp@@ ren@@ avi@@ r Resi@@ sten@@ z@@ pf@@ ade , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ sp@@ ectively , not pre @-@ treated patients , where a Fos@@ avi@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 insul@@ ates ) , in@@ din@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isolation ) , and Ti@@ p@@ ran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 isolation ) . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prototype @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
the early break@@ age of a vers@@ ag@@ eing therapy is recommended to keep the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations in boundaries which can affect the subsequent treatment .
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of a@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study ( 100@@ mg twice daily ) and Nu@@ cl@@ e@@ osi@@ dan@@ alog@@ a ( NR@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , so@@ c ) with a PI , predominantly with lower mo@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; two @-@ three sixty @-@ six ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity towards A@@ generic , at least another PI and at least a NR@@ TI were included in the part study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
the primary analysis presented the non @-@ sub@@ sist@@ ence of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r compared to the time @-@ ad@@ missible average change ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plas@@ ma last ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the plas@@ ma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ negoti@@ ator threshold of 0,@@ 4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the effectiveness of un@@ geb@@ oo@@ st@@ ated A@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 288 HIV infected children aged 2 to 18 years , of which 152 with PI were treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic solution to take and capsules in doses of 15 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg every day , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , whereby the majority of patients were 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
it was given no low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r at the same time ; the majority of those with PI patients had previously received at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of along with A@@ generic NR@@ TI@@ s .
&quot; after 48 weeks , about 25 % of the patients included a plas@@ ma HIV @-@ 1 @-@ RNA @-@ concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml at a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell number of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the output . &quot;
19 Basi@@ cally this data should be considered in the treatment of treatment with PI of the children of expected benefits of &quot; un@@ bent &quot; A@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) up to the maximum Ser@@ um concentration of Am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max against 30 % reduced , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) along with Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) , was administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % reduction of AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r 12 hours by dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained un@@ influenced by the food intake , although the simultaneous food intake influences the extent and rate of the res@@ or@@ ption . &quot;
the seem@@ ing volume of approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a body weight of 70 kg ) and leaves to be a large distribution volume as well as an enormous penetration of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r from the blood circulation into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a capture of the overall concentration of the active ingredient in the plas@@ ma , with the amount of un@@ conventional amalg@@ am@@ avi@@ r that represents the active share probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ conventional Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active components during the d@@ ady interval in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duced or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which can be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ generic capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily am@@ an@@ avi@@ r @-@ exposure as in adults with a dosage of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r is from the solution 14 % less bi@@ osis than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ generic solution and aspir@@ ase capsules are not inter@@ change@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of a kidney disease is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schem@@ ata lead to am@@ an@@ avi@@ r @-@ plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ers comparable to those who are obtained in healthy proportions after a dose of 1200 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the edge @-@ balance with Am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cellular ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to people , after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ cellular cellular and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ ved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies and the therapeutic application , however , there are little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of In @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vit@@ ro @-@ gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity testing , the bacterial infection testing ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ atic testing ( Am@@ es @-@ test ) , mouse @-@ ly@@ mph@@ atic testing ( Am@@ es @-@ Test ) , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ omes , was am@@ an@@ avi@@ r neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ i@@ ously . &quot;
this liver tox@@ icity can be monitored and detected in clinical everyday life through the measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of al@@ kal@@ ine Ph@@ osph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; until now , clinical studies have not been observed any significant liver tox@@ icity in patients , neither during administration of A@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in young people were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and the am@@ an@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals . &quot;
&quot; in a system@@ ic plas@@ ma , the significant exposure ( rab@@ bits ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure to therapeutic dosage were observed , however , a number of low @-@ day changes including thy@@ ro@@ el@@ ong@@ ation and low @-@ sk@@ el@@ eton @-@ sk@@ el@@ eton observed , which point to a consumed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic capsules are applied without the ampli@@ fication of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ stery ) , higher doses must be applied to A@@ generic ( 1200 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg Am@@ al@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 2400 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; simultaneous application is to be performed in patients with fl@@ atter@@ er or lighter liver interference with caution , in patients with severe liver interference ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects , such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; A@@ generic ase should be set on duration 27 , if a rash may be accompanied by system@@ ic or allergic symptoms , or the vei@@ ls are involved ( see Section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; a tax risk for a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors such as higher age , and with medication @-@ dependent factors such as a longer continuous anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and the associated metabo@@ lic disorders associated with the associated metabo@@ lic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in a 82 % reduction in AU@@ C is caused by Am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r who can lead to a vi@@ rolog@@ ical failure and lead to a residential development .
&quot; 5@@ 08 % increased , for C@@ max , by 30 % lower , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of Am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r in Plas@@ ma , which were obtained during the combination of am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg k@@ avi@@ r ) , approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg k@@ avi@@ r twice a day . &quot;
&quot; a met@@ ering recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra can not be given , however , it is recommended to be a closer monitoring since the effectiveness and imm@@ uni@@ formity of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ f@@ avi@@ r@@ enz in combination with am@@ os@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ esters were low .
&quot; when these medicines are being applied together , caution is advisable ; a thorough clinical and vi@@ rolog@@ ical monitoring is to be made , as an accurate forecast of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ro@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if there is a clinical reasons required , ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with A@@ gener@@ ase is needed to decrease the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although there is no clinical data available . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ um concentr@@ ations of calcium switches such as Am@@ lo@@ di@@ pin , Dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pin , kidney pin , ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@ fi@@ pin , ni@@ cot@@ di@@ pin and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased by Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , causing possibly the activity and tox@@ icity of this medicine . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , in Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flight pro@@ pi@@ on@@ at in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) , while the endo@@ wed cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by approximately 86 % ( 90 % mixed intervals : 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous gift of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants , along with A@@ gener@@ ase , an enhanced control of IN@@ R ( International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) is recommended due to the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ th@@ ic effect ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of Orth@@ o @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.@@ 0@@ 35 mg E@@ thin@@ yl@@ es@@ tradi@@ ol plus 1,0 mg Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ on ) led to a decrease of AU@@ C and C@@ min by Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r at 22 % b@@ z@@ w .
this drug may only be applied during pregnancy only after careful dis@@ rup@@ tions of the potential utility for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us .
&quot; a Re@@ production study of impair@@ ment , which was administ@@ ered by the objection in the uter@@ us to the end of the lac@@ tation Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r , showed during the lac@@ tation period a dimin@@ ished increase in weight @-@ weight in succession . &quot;
the in@@ adequ@@ acy of A@@ gener@@ ase has been studied in adults and children over 4 years in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient is to observe signs of an inc@@ ision ( see Section 4.8 ) if necessary , necessary support measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r in vit@@ ro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ IB has been studied both at acute and chron@@ ically in@@ ated lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ C@@ CR@@ F , H@@ 9 ) as well as periph@@ eral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ m@@ kon@@ zentr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r lies in the range from 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M when ak@@ ut infected cells and amounts to chronic µ@@ M ( 1 µ@@ g = 0.50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r reserves its activity against some other prototype @-@ resistant isol@@ ate ; the preservation of these activity seems to be dependent on the number and type of resistance @-@ mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data should be considered in the treatment of treatment of &quot; &quot; untreated &quot; &quot; general benefit of &quot; &quot; un@@ conventional &quot; &quot; A@@ generic &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ conventional Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r remains constant , fluctu@@ ates the percentage of free active components during the d@@ ady interval in the Ste@@ ady @-@ State on the range of C@@ max , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines , the CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 in@@ duced or inhi@@ bited or a sub@@ str@@ ate of CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 which can be administ@@ ered with caution when they are given simultaneously with A@@ gener@@ ase ( see sections 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ ale Clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of a kidney disease is likely to be low on the Eli@@ mination of Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies for the edge @-@ balance with Am@@ amp@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats appeared in male animals ben@@ ig@@ ne hep@@ at@@ cellular ( mice ) or 3,@@ 8@@ - times ( R@@ atte ) of exposure to people after twice daily gift of 1200 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the emergence of the hep@@ at@@ oc@@ ular aden@@ ome and car@@ cin@@ ome has not yet been elu@@ ci@@ ved and the relevance of these observed effects for man is unclear .
&quot; from the present exposure data on people , both from clinical studies as well as the therapeutic application , however , little evidence of the adoption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;

&quot; studies on tox@@ icity in young people were treated from an age of 4 days , showed both in the control and the am@@ an@@ avi@@ r @-@ treated animals . &quot;
&quot; these results can conclude that in juven@@ iles , the Met@@ abol@@ ism is not yet fully mature , so that Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;

&quot; the use of car@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; geb@@ oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; &quot; A@@ generic solution for entry was neither treated with PI @-@ treated patients nor with PI @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ ob@@ avi@@ r as a solution to the entry is 14 % less than by Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore , A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram of a milli@@ gram base are not inter@@ change@@ able ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be as soon as they are able to sw@@ allow the capsules , with the intake of the solution to enter ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic solution is 17 mg ( 1 ml ) Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg Am@@ mer@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , there is no dosage recommendations for the simultaneous application of A@@ generic solution for taking and low do@@ si@@ fied k@@ on@@ avi@@ r can be avoided this combination with these patients . &quot;
&quot; although a dosage adjustment is not necessary for am@@ an@@ avi@@ r , is an application of A@@ generic solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure ( see Section 4.3 ) . &quot;

patients should be noted that A@@ generative or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including treatment with A@@ gener@@ ase does not prevent risk to transfer HIV to others through sexual contact or contam@@ ination .
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as Car@@ b@@ amaz@@ ep@@ in , Phen@@ yl@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cycli@@ c anti@@ depress@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under supervision of the International norm@@ ised rati@@ o ) , methods are available for determining the drug con@@ centr@@ ation . &quot;

&quot; in these patients , there should be a degrad@@ ation between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ @-@ off or Gr@@ aft @-@ host@@ - reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , where no daily pre @-@ auth@@ en@@ etics have been carried out , two cases of severe P@@ him@@ ose and a case has been observed with one to the circum@@ c@@ ision of leading stri@@ pes . &quot;
&quot; in case of an application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream in higher than the recommended doses , there is also risk of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation ( see Section 4.2 . ) In rare cases also has been observed under knowledgeable application of heavy local skin irrit@@ ation that made a treatment required and / or to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions appeared at the exit of the ure@@ th@@ ra , some women had difficulty in water , which made an emergency cath@@ odi@@ zation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; to use I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ ams directly following the treatment with other cut@@ aneous appli@@ ences in the genital war@@ ts in the gen@@ ital@@ - and Peri@@ an@@ al@@ field have no clinical experience until now . &quot;
limited data refers to an increased rate of incl@@ ine reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients to I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ ams has shown a lower effectiveness in this patient group .
&quot; the treatment of the Bas@@ al cell of Bas@@ que with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od within 1 cm around the eyel@@ ids , the nose , the lips , or the hair approach was not investigated . &quot;
local building actions are common but the intensity of these reactions occur in general during therapy or the reactions will be back after completing the treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is required due to the complaints of the patient or due to sever@@ ity of local building actions , a treatment of several days can be done . &quot;
the clinical result of therapy can be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; there is currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of over 36 months after treatment , should be considered at super@@ fic@@ tional bas@@ al cell or other suitable treatment forms . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ C@@ s there are no clinical experience , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ours . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial point out that at large tum@@ ours ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) a lower probability of the response to the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od was not examined for the treatment of academic ker@@ at@@ ants on eyel@@ ids , inside the nose or the ears or on the lip area inside the Li@@ ppen@@ r@@ ots . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of academic ker@@ at@@ ants of anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and the sc@@ alp .
&quot; the available data on the frac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose , on the lower and hands support the effectiveness in this application , therefore , such application is not recommended . &quot;
local door@@ step frequently occur on but these reactions usually take back in the course of therapy and go back after lowering the therapy with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od cream .
&quot; if local Hau@@ ders are causing great discomfort or are very strong , the treatment can be exposed for a few days . &quot;
&quot; from the data of an open clinical study , patients with more than 8 AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons increases a lower complete healing rate than patients with less than 8 l@@ esi@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; due to the immune stimul@@ ates properties , I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ ams should be applied with caution in patients who get an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; from animal studies no direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fat development , the discharge or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although not according to a non@@ recur@@ ring application quanti@@ fiable ser@@ um mirror ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , no recommendation to apply during the lac@@ tation period can be given . &quot;
the most often shared and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ am related side effects in trials with three times weekly treatment were local reactions in the place of treatment of the incl@@ inations ( 33,@@ 7 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od to patients ) .
&quot; among the most commonly reported and considered most likely , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ cream in connection with side effects , complaints about the application of 28,@@ 1 % . &quot;
the patients treated by 185 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ ams treated Bas@@ ali@@ om patients from a plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical study of Phase III @-@ effects are shown below .
the most common as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ ams in relation to these studies were a reaction at the applic@@ ant ( 22 % of the patients treated with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od to patients ) .
&quot; the side effects , which were specified by 252 in plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials in phase III with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od @-@ Cre@@ ams which were specified patients with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; this according to the aud@@ iting plan of the clinical signs indicates that there are often such plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with three times @-@ controlled clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ ams frequently to local building transactions including Er@@ y@@ them ( 61 % ) , ero@@ sion ( 30 % ) and eyel@@ et ( 14 % ) ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; this according to the aud@@ iting plan of the clinical signs indicates that in these studies with five times a week treatment with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ ams are very common to serious income issues ( 13 % ) , heavy ero@@ on ( 13 % ) , and to severe Sh@@ or@@ ation and sales ( 19 % ) . &quot;
in clinical studies for exam@@ ining the application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od for the treatment of the ak@@ tin@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ osis was al@@ op@@ d@@ zie with a frequency of 0.@@ 4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment office or in the surrounding area .
&quot; the sing@@ ular unique or@@ ical intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od , which corresponds to the content of about 16 bags , could lead to nau@@ sea , head@@ aches , head@@ aches , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side @-@ effect , which appeared after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted in hyp@@ ot@@ ony , based on oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation have been proven according to the top@@ ical application of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od growing system@@ ic concentr@@ ations of the Alp@@ ha@@ inter@@ fer@@ ons and other cy@@ to@@ k@@ ine .
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the effectiveness in relation to a complete curing of the incl@@ ine was clearly superior to a plac@@ ebo treatment over 16 weeks of plac@@ ebo .
at 60 % of the total 119 with I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od therapy patients healed patients completely from ; this was at 20 % of the 105 with plac@@ ebo therapies were the case ( 95 % CI ) :
a complete healing could be achieved by 23 % of 157 with i@@ quim@@ od@@ ine treated male patients compared to 5 % of 161 with plac@@ ebo treated male patients ( 95 % CI )
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od at five thousand applications per week over 6 weeks has been studied in two double blind , plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the audi@@ ences were hist@@ ological confirmed individual primary super@@ fic@@ ated bas@@ al cell @-@ cell with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years of present data show that about 7@@ 9.3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.7 % , 8@@ 4.9 % ) &#93; of all treated patients to be clin@@ ically cured and this was also 48 months long . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od at three times weekly application in one or two treatment rooms of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four week , treatment time period , was examined in two double blind , plac@@ ebo@@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , not hyper@@ pl@@ at@@ ot@@ esque , not hyper@@ trop@@ hies AK@@ - l@@ esi@@ ons within one @-@ related 25 c@@ m2 large treatment are@@ als on the un@@ ha@@ iry sc@@ alp or in the face . &quot;
the @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show patients with clin@@ ically cooling after one or two treatment rooms a re@@ zi@@ di@@ v@@ rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) .
the approved indications of outer fil@@ es@@ war@@ ts , Ak@@ tin@@ ic Ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fic@@ ational bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients generally not and were therefore not investigated . &quot;
Al@@ dara Cre@@ ams was examined in four random@@ ised , double blind plac@@ ebo @-@ controlled studies on children aged 2 to 15 years with M@@ oll@@ us@@ c@@ um Cont@@ agi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , plac@@ ebo n = 313 ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od could not be shown in these studies at the dos@@ ages ( 3x / week for a period of &lt; 16 weeks b@@ z@@ w .
a minimum system@@ ic intake of the 5 % of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od Cre@@ ams through the skin of 58 patients with acute ker@@ at@@ ose was observed at the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest medicine con@@ centralized in Ser@@ um at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amo@@ unted 0.1 , 0,@@ 2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the use in the face ( 12.5 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated @-@ obvious half @-@ time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the 2@@ hour half @-@ time after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in a previous study ; this indicates a prolonged re@@ ten@@ tion of the medication by means of the skin .
the data for system@@ ic exposure showed that the res@@ or@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od following top@@ ical application of patients aged 6 - 12 years was low and comparable with that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ent ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ bly bas@@ al cell car@@ cin@@ oma .
in a four mon@@ ati@@ zed study on the der@@ mal tox@@ icity in the rat led doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG to significantly lower body weight and maneu@@ ver@@ em lac@@ tic weight ; one also four months long performed trial to the der@@ mal application revealed in the mouse no similar effects .
a two @-@ year study of car@@ cin@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y with mice on three days a week in@@ duced no tum@@ ors at the application point .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ quim@@ od is only a low system@@ ic absorption from the human skin and not mut@@ ations , is a risk for man due to the system@@ ic exposure to be very low . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice , treated with the real @-@ free cream , formerly and in larger numbers than in the control group with lower U@@ VR . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if these same symptoms have as you . − If any of the listed effects you have considerably imp@@ acted or you notice side effects that are not listed in this usage information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;

&quot; in the study , mainly the security of the medicine was investigated , however , it was also measured its effectiveness ( by its effect regarding reducing the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in urine and regarding the size of the liver investigated ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me passed the G@@ AG concentr@@ ations in the urine around 60 % , and half of the children treated at the end of the study a normal great liver . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed with more than 1 of 10 patients ) are head@@ aches , nau@@ sea , Ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limb@@ s ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ fever , fever and reactions to the inf@@ usion set . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measuring size of the lung function ) , T@@ ach@@ y@@ kar@@ st ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and sho@@ ok . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may in patients suffering , which may possibly be highly sensitive ( allergic ) on Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or one of the other components ( an@@ aphy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) , will not be applied . &quot;

June 2003 the European Commission shared the Company Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.@@ V. a permit for the transport of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union .
Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α @-@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced by means of re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using Ch@@ o @-@ mam@@ mal @-@ cell cultures ( Chinese Ham@@ ster O@@ vary , E@@ ier@@ stock of the Chinese Ham@@ sters ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is for the long @-@ time enzy@@ me therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a mu@@ kop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ de I ( M@@ PS I , α @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase @-@ deficiency ) indi@@ ces to treat the non @-@ neurological manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be done by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabo@@ lic diseases .
&quot; the initial inf@@ usion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient gets toler@@ ated this , every 15 minutes drive into a maximum speed of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined , and for these patients no d@@ osing scheme can be recommended . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver in@@ suff@@ iciency was not determined , and for these patients cannot be recommended for d@@ osing scheme . &quot;
&quot; with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treat@@ able patients can develop inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reactions , which are defined as any related side @-@ effect , which occurs during the inf@@ usion or until the end of the inf@@ usion set ( see section 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be monitored closely and inf@@ usion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be made available in a reasonable clinical environment in the re@@ vit@@ ational environment for medical emergen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , almost all patients know Ig@@ G antibodies against lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase , usually within 3 months of treatment . &quot;
&quot; patients , the antibodies or symptoms of inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reaction , must be treated with caution when applying al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see sections 4.3 and 4.8 ) . &quot;
&quot; because little experience regarding the recovery of treatment after a longer break , has to be taken careful due to the theoretically possible risk reaction after a break in the treatment . &quot;
60 minutes before the start of inf@@ usion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and / or anti@@ py@@ re@@ tika ) to be used to minimize the potential inf@@ usion of inf@@ usion reactions .
&quot; in the case of light or medium @-@ heavy inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and acet@@ amin@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen would be wei@@ gh@@ ed and / or a reduction of inf@@ usion rate upon half of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , heavy inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reaction , the inf@@ usion must be stopped , until the symptoms associated with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and Par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is weak@@ ened . &quot;
inf@@ usion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate when the reaction occurred .
&quot; 3 are ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) , as well as a reduction in inf@@ usion rate at 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the inf@@ usion rate , in which the estimated reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or Proc@@ ain , because a potential risk of an interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular recording of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase exists . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect impact on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no data on new@@ bor@@ ns that were exp@@ elled from Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase over the mother &apos;s milk , is recommended , during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me not to breast@@ feeding . &quot;
the side effects in clinical trials were used mainly as inf@@ usion condi@@ tional reactions to 53 % of patients in the phase 3 study ( treatment time up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( treatment duration up to 1 year ) .
unwanted medicines used in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me who were observed during the phase 3 study and the extension of a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older during treatment of up to 4 years ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) ; frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with heavy M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ condi@@ tional participation of the upper respir@@ atory and lungs in the history , moreover , heavy reactions to , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respir@@ atory and fac@@ ili@@ es ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children of dis@@ able medicines associated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a ph@@ as@@ - 2 study with a total of 20 patients aged under 5 years , with mainly heavy or@@ bit and treatment time up to 12 months , reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; for most patients , it occurred within 3 months after the treatment of a ser@@ otonin version , whereas in the patients aged under 5 years with a he@@ avier distor@@ tion form ( on average after 26 days compared to patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the phase 3 @-@ 3 study ( or up to a premature retirement from the study ) , at 13 / 45 patients no controlled by radio@@ immun@@ o@@ lics ( Rip ) As@@ say veri@@ fiable antibodies above , including 3 patients , where it never came to Ser@@ o@@ kon@@ os . &quot;
patients with lack of up to lower antibodies displayed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG es@@ pi@@ eg@@ els in the har@@ n while in patients with high antibodies in the har@@ n can be as@@ cert@@ ained .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a margin@@ ally to low neutr@@ alised inhibit@@ or activity in vit@@ ro that seemed to affect the clinical effectiveness and / or the reduction of G@@ AG in the Har@@ n .
the presence of antibodies seemed to be related to the incidence of unwanted medicines and even if the appearance of undes@@ irable medicines used typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies .
the reason for the enzy@@ me therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the frac@@ turing sub@@ str@@ ate and preventing another accumulation of sufficient restoration of the enzy@@ tivity .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous Inf@@ usion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly taken out of the circulation and recorded cells into ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely about Mann@@ ose @-@ 6 @-@ phosph@@ or@@ at@@ - recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and effectiveness of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ized , dou@@ bl@@ blin@@ ded phase @-@ 3 study at 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , the majority of patients were reported from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient pointed to the heavy phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a for@@ ci@@ zed exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end points for the effectiveness were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute en@@ closure in the 6 @-@ min@@ ut@@ - hearing test .
all patients have subsequently been recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received another 3.5 years ( 182 weeks ) each week 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me .
&quot; after 26 weeks therapy , the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me treated patients compared to the plac@@ ebo group , an improvement of the lung function and the sal@@ vi@@ ability which is shown in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed up an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 208 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and 182 weeks in plac@@ ebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown from the following table .
the decrease of the expected percentage FE@@ V is not significant over this period of clin@@ ically not significant and the absolute lung vol@@ um@@ ina increased further proportional to the height of growing children .
&quot; from the 26 patients with a Hep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly , treatment reached 22 ( 85 % ) to the end of the study a normal liver size . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a clear waste of the G@@ AG mirror in the Har@@ n ( µ@@ g / mg cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine ) was established until the study was constant .
&quot; regarding the heter@@ ogen@@ ic path@@ ogen@@ ic balance between patients affected by using a combined end product ( an expected process of normal FE@@ V , circuit in 6 @-@ minute en@@ closure , movement in 6 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
&quot; it was conducted a one @-@ year open phase 2 study , primarily the security and pharmaceutical in@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me during 20 patients were examined at the time of their recording into the study under 5 years ( 16 patients with the heavy or@@ bit form ) . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the dosage was increased by increased G@@ AG@@ - mirror in the Har@@ n in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg . &quot;
&quot; in several patients , a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight increase ( n = 3 ) has been established after the Z @-@ Score for this age group The younger patients with the severe dis@@ continued form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with severe distor@@ tion form , have limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies have been conducted to pharmac@@ ogen@@ ic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me @-@ d@@ osing schem@@ ata on the G@@ AG mirror in the resin , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a weekly , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the d@@ osing scheme with 200 E / kg of intraven@@ ously represent every 2 weeks in patients , the difficulties with weekly inf@@ usions , have a reasonable alternative , however , is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two d@@ osing schem@@ ata is equal . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is being used together with cis@@ pl@@ atin ( a different medicine against cancer ) if cancer is not being removed ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( mal@@ ign@@ ant ) , if cancer has already spread to other parts of the body . • advanced or metastatic &quot; non @-@ specific &quot; lung cancer , which does not attack the record epith@@ eli@@ um cells . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not been treated previously , in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies previously used as a single therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should obtain an Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fol@@ ate acid ( a vitamin ) and inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administ@@ ered together with cis@@ pl@@ atin , in addition , or after the gift of Cis@@ pl@@ atin additionally an &quot; anti@@ em@@ e@@ tik@@ um &quot; ( medicines to break ) and flu@@ ids ( in order to bow flu@@ ids ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should appear up , or the dose should be reduced . &quot;
the active form of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed requires the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells share .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in its active form goes easier throughout cancer cells , which leads to higher concentr@@ ations of the active form of drug means and a longer active time of cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of mal@@ ign@@ ant Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ oms , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 456 patients who had previously received any chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; compared to the treatment of non @-@ specific lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 571 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease that had previously been treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared with Gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ in ( another medicine against cancer ) , while in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin in a study at 1 7@@ 25 patients , which previously had no chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
&quot; patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and Cis@@ pl@@ atin , were compared with 9,@@ 3 months , compared to 9,@@ 3 months during the single administration of Cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients who had previously received a chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8,@@ 3 months , compared to 7.3 months at Doc@@ et@@ ax@@ el . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients , in which cancer does not attack the record epith@@ eli@@ um , in the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta longer over@@ life times than with the compar@@ ative medicine . &quot;
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared the El@@ i Lil@@ ly Ne@@ derland B.@@ V. a permit for the in@@ scription of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each flow bottle must be raised with 4.2 ml 0.3 % of nat@@ ri@@ chl@@ ori@@ de injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) - what a solution of 25 mg / ml y@@ ields .
the corresponding volume of the necessary Do@@ - S@@ IS is taken from diar@@ rhe@@ a and with 0.2 % of nat@@ u@@ um@@ chl@@ ori@@ de injection resolution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see Section 6.6 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is shown in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin shown to the first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for con@@ spic@@ uous hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
AL@@ IM@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is shown for the treatment in a second @-@ line treatment of patients with lo@@ - K@@ al advanced or metastatic non@@ woven bron@@ chi@@ al@@ car@@ cin@@ oma except for super@@ glob@@ alized hist@@ ology ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² body surface ( KO@@ F ) administ@@ ered as intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of Cis@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an inf@@ usion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - Inf@@ usion on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ cl@@ esi@@ ed bron@@ chi@@ al@@ kar@@ zin@@ om , following chemotherapy , the recommended dose of AL@@ IM@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F administ@@ ered as a intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 @-@ day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to the reduction of frequency and sever@@ ity of front actions must be given on the day before and on the day of the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed gift , as well as on the day after the treatment a cor@@ tico @-@ ster@@ oid . &quot;
during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be taken at least 5 doses and intake must be continued during the entire spa treatments and for more 21 days after the last P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dosage .
patients also need to receive a in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular injection vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week prior to the first P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dosage and after each third Be@@ - handy cycle .
&quot; in patients , the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed received , each gift should be created a full blood image , including a differenti@@ ation of the leu@@ ko@@ zy@@ ten and a Th@@ ro@@ ast@@ zy@@ ten@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; al@@ kal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ at @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and Al@@ an@@ in @-@ Tran@@ sam@@ in@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 @-@ fold of the upper border . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose of treatment must take place under Ber@@ consider@@ ate the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood bil@@ ity@@ or of the maximum un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ological tox@@ icity of the previous therap@@ ists . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients need to be treated according to indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are applicable to AL@@ IM@@ TA as a mon@@ otherapy or in combination with cis@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria meet the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common tox@@ icity C@@ rit@@ eria ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) &gt; C@@ TC degrees 2 blood .
&quot; should patients do not develop hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity &gt; Grad 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity ) , the patient must be interrupted with AL@@ IM@@ TA until the patient has the value in front of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with AL@@ IM@@ TA must be cancelled if in patients after 2 dos@@ er tox@@ icity , or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity degree 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - fort at the appearance of degree 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity . &quot;
clinical trials have no indication of that in patients aged 65 year@@ s@@ - or in comparison to patients aged 65 years of age 65 years of age .
AL@@ IM@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to non @-@ rei@@ mb@@ urs@@ ement data on infin@@ ity and effectiveness .
clinical trials were needed in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of &gt; 45 ml / min no Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations needed to go beyond that for all patients recommended Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ ations .
&quot; the data base in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance from under 45 ml / min was not sufficient , therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients were examined using a liver functioning of the upper B@@ ili@@ ru@@ bin@@ s and / or Tran@@ sam@@ ase values of &gt; the 3,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper threshold ( at Ab@@ - Wes@@ er of Leb@@ er@@ metastatic ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ times of the upper border @-@ ( in the presence of Leb@@ er@@ metastatic asen ) . &quot;
patients must be administ@@ ered with regard to the Kno@@ wing mark@@ ings and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be administ@@ ered to patients before absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ al number once again reaches a value of &gt; 100,000 cells / mm ³ .
&quot; a dosage reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adir of the absolute ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ ph@@ onic number , thy@@ ro@@ id number and maxim@@ ized non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological tox@@ icity , as they were observed in the previous treatment cycles - the ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower tox@@ icity and a reduction of level 3 / 4 ugly tox@@ icity like Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie and infection with degrees 3 / 4 Ne@@ ut@@ ro@@ pen@@ ie was indic@@ ted if a pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients need to be instruc@@ ted with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed to patients , fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a prophy@@ lac@@ tic measure to reduce the reduction of condi@@ tional tox@@ icity ( see Section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 up to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and Ac@@ et@@ yl@@ sali@@ va ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; all patients , for which treatment is planned with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , must avoid intake of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long semi @-@ time period for at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred , had corresponding risk factors for the appearance of ren@@ al events , including expansion of hyper@@ tension , or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with clin@@ ically significant hydr@@ ation - accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a dra@@ inage of the result before the P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ treatment will be wo@@ unded . &quot;
&quot; five severe cardiovascular events , including M@@ yo@@ car@@ dinal colored , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical studies with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed occasionally , if this substance is usually administ@@ ered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application atten@@ ds ( except yel@@ lo@@ wing , this vaccine is con@@ trained ) not recommended ( see Section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of a irre@@ ver@@ sible Shepherd of the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before treatment - g@@ inn insi@@ sting to pick advice regarding the sperm time . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) , high doses , non @-@ ster@@ o@@ idal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ka ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ hydro@@ flu@@ oric acid in high dosage ( &gt; 1,3 g daily ) to a decreased P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ex@@ cre@@ tion with the result of a multip@@ lied suspension of side effects . &quot;
therefore caution is advisable when patients with normal kidney function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &gt; 80 ml / min ) high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or Ac@@ e- t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ oric acid in high dosage .
&quot; I@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ - ac@@ idity in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and min@@ de@@ - TEN@@ S 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed avoided ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no data in terms of interest potential as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or Ro@@ fec@@ ox@@ ib , the simultaneous application of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must be avoided at least 5 days before the therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the t@@ inn@@ ate status during the disease and the possibility of inter@@ dependen@@ cy between oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased surveillance frequency of IN@@ R ( International normal Rati@@ o ) if the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as in an@@ de@@ - an@@ tim@@ ed an@@ tim@@ ately needs to be expected in the pregnancy serious Birth@@ def@@ ective . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed must not be applied during pregnancy , except if necessarily , demanding , and after careful wast@@ ew@@ ing of the utility for the mother and risk to the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity is made by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised before the treatment of treatment , advice regarding the sperm preser@@ v@@ atives . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed goes into the mother &apos;s milk and unwanted effects on increasing inf@@ ants can not be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and sever@@ ity unwanted effects that were reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , as well as 163 patients with mes@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om , which received random@@ ized Cis@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy . &quot;

the primary analysis of this study was conducted in the population of all patients administ@@ ered in the treatment of treatment ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ no@@ e ) in connection with the mal@@ ig@@ nition Ple@@ ur@@ am@@ es@@ ot@@ hel@@ i@@ om was shown in the AL@@ IM@@ TA / Cis@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 212 patients ) opposite the sole Cis@@ pl@@ a- T@@ in arm ( 218 patients ) .

&quot; alli is used for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I &gt; 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ine , o@@ fi@@ du@@ ous diet . &quot;
&quot; alli may not be applied to children and young people under 18 , as do not have sufficient data on the effectiveness and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , Or@@ li@@ stat is only minimal res@@ or@@ ally , is with elders and in patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function no adaptation of the dosage . &quot;

the probability of rising gast@@ ro@@ wer intimate symptoms ( see Section 4.8 ) can increase if alli is taken along with a fet@@ al meal or fet@@ al diet .
&quot; as the weight reduction in diabetes can go down with improved metabo@@ lic control , patients , which must consult a medicine against diabetes , before starting a therapy with alli a doctor or chem@@ ist , because the dosage must be adapted . &quot;
&quot; patients , the alli as well as medicines for hyper@@ tension or an increased cholesterol level , should consult their doctor or pharmac@@ ists if the dosage must be adapted to this medicine . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended , to meet additional fluctu@@ ating measures to make this in the case of severe th@@ ar@@ rh@@ ö possible failure of the oral contrast ( see Section 4.5 ) . &quot;
both in a study on interactions of drugs as well as in several cases with simultaneous application of Or@@ li@@ stat and Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in was observed an ab@@ dic@@ ation of the Ci@@ clos@@ por@@ in Plas@@ mas@@ pi@@ ails .

&quot; the side @-@ effects of or@@ li@@ stat are mainly gast@@ ro@@ vi@@ cious nature and hang out with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medication by means , as the absorption of lon@@ ged fat is prevented . &quot;
the gast@@ ro@@ mb@@ al side effects were obtained from clinical studies with Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally easy and temporary .
&quot; the frequency are defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , is not known ( frequency on the basis of available data . &quot;
&quot; the incidence of known unwanted side effects , which were established after the launch of Or@@ li@@ stat , is not known as these events voluntarily sur@@ rendered by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with alli lead to cl@@ amps in terms of possible or actual gast@@ ro@@ vi@@ cal side effects .
single d@@ ants of 800 mg Or@@ li@@ stat and multi @-@ level of up to 400 mg three times a day were administ@@ ered for a period of 15 days to normal and overweight proportions .
&quot; in the majority of the cases reported by Or@@ li@@ stat transitions , either side @-@ effects or similar side effects such as at the recommended dose of Or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;
&quot; based on investigations on human and animal may be attributed to a fast re@@ formation of system@@ ic system , which are attri@@ but@@ able to the Libyan properties from or@@ li@@ stat . &quot;

&quot; the primary parameters , the change of body weight compared to the output value ( at the time of Rand@@ om@@ isation ) , has been rated as follows : as a change of body weight in the study course ( table 1 ) and as a percentage of those students who have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of its output weight ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although in both studies the weight reduction has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurs during the first six months . &quot;
the average change in the total cholester@@ in was amo@@ unted to Or@@ li@@ stat 60 mg -@@ 2.0 % ( output rating 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with plac@@ ebo + 2.8 % ( output value 5,@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist , if any of the listed side effects you can greatly imp@@ acted or you notice side effects that are not stated in this usage information . &quot;
the most common side effects depend on the way of the capsules combined with the active one that multip@@ lies fat from the body left out .
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first few weeks after the treatment course , since you have not yet consistently reduced the fat content in the diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules you can learn to minimize the nutritional defic@@ ien@@ cies : • If you already have a few days , or better a week before the first intake of capsules with a fatty diet . • learning more about the usual fat content of your favourite food and over the size of the portions you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , sin@@ ks the lik@@ eli@@ hood you get out of your fat . • Use your recommended li@@ pos@@ sessions as even@@ ly to the daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you may take a meal to take , not to take them in the form of a fet@@ ched main court or a ch@@ illed retro@@ sp@@ ection , as you may occur in other programs for weight reduction . • Most people in which these companions occur , learn to control this with time through adaptation of their diet . &quot;
• Pos@@ sibility to maintain medicines for children . • You may not apply any more about 25 ° C to protect the content from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with sili@@ c@@ ag@@ el which serve to hold capsules dry .

&quot; Alo@@ xi is applied in Chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as cis@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are a trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( such as Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional gift of a Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ e@@ tical ) .
&quot; the application in patients under 18 years is not recommended , since the effects in this age group is not enough information available . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active ingredient of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amine ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ otonin ) to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi has been studied in three main studies on 1 8@@ 42 adults , the chem@@ otherap@@ ies received , which are strong or strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; with chemotherapy , the strong trigger for nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting are 59 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 223 ) , compared to 57 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 126 of 221 ) . &quot;
&quot; with chemotherapy , the excessive trigger for nau@@ sea and break , showed 81 % of patients who were treated with Alo@@ xi in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 189 ) , compared to 69 % of the patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron patients ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values at 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 189 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 from 191 patients ) .
March 2005 the European Commission shared with Helsinki Bi@@ rex Pharmac@@ euticals Ltd . a licence for the transport of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union .
Alo@@ xi is indi@@ ces : to prevent ac@@ ron@@ eous nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ eous chemotherapy due to cancer prevention and for the prevention of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting at moderate chemotherapy because of cancer .
&quot; the effectiveness of Alo@@ xi to prevent nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting , which is in@@ duced by a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy , can be reinforced by adding a prior to chemotherapy given Corti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; as Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can extend the Dick@@ dar@@ mp@@ ass@@ age , patients should be monitored with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ al Ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us after the injection mol@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; however , like with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 Ant@@ ag@@ onists , however , caution is advisable to extend the Q@@ T Inter@@ v@@ all or in patients with which Q@@ t- Inter@@ v@@ all is extended or that is one of such an extension . &quot;
&quot; except in connection with a further chemical @-@ otherap@@ eu@@ tika @-@ gift , al@@ xi should neither be used in the days after chemotherapy nor for the treatment of nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies inhi@@ bited Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron used against tum@@ ors and activity of the five examined chemotherapy ( Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ amide , Cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ omy@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a unique intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ el@@ op@@ ram@@ ids , a CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; shown in a population of a population of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis was shown that the simultaneous gift of CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ In@@ hi@@ os ( A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on , C@@ im@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Col@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ alin and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant impact on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experience for application of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ an@@ cies are not before , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be applied with Schw@@ ang@@ eren , unless it is necessary from the care physician than necessary . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common in a dose of 250 micro@@ grams on watching side effects ( overall 633 patients ) , which were at least possibly with Alo@@ xi in connection with head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ p@@ ation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the appointments ( burning , har@@ dening , complaints and pain ) were stated in post @-@ marketing experience . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar incidence of unwanted events like in the other disp@@ arities ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies were carried out due to the large distribution volume , however , a di@@ aly@@ sis probably has no effective therapy for a Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double bl@@ ind@@ studies , total of 1.@@ 132 patients , which received a moderate @-@ sized chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 Cis@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin ( half @-@ time 4 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7.2 hours ) or 100 mg of Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ time 7,@@ 3 hours ) , which was given on day 1 without D@@ ex@@ ame@@ th@@ as@@ on intraven@@ ous . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double bl@@ ind@@ ly study , a total of 667 patients who received a strongly em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ic chemotherapy with &gt; 60 mg / m2 Cycl@@ oph@@ osph@@ ere , and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ b@@ azin and 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , compared to patients who were given 32 mg of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron , which were given to 1 intraven@@ ously . &quot;
results of the studies with moderate chemotherapy and the study with strong em@@ et@@ ogen@@ ous chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical studies on the indication of chemotherapy @-@ in@@ duced nau@@ sea and v@@ om@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) were the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate , and E@@ KG parameters , including the Q@@ T@@ c interval , including the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the I@@ onal and Rep@@ ol@@ ar@@ isation of the I@@ onic channels and to pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
the aim of the study carried out by 221 healthy proportions of the study was the assessment of the E@@ KG effects of i.@@ V. administ@@ ered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single @-@ p@@ ants of 0,25 , 0,75 and Picture mg . &quot;
res@@ or@@ ption After intraven@@ ous gift follows an initi@@ ale decrease of Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ations a slow Eli@@ mination from the body with an average time half @-@ time period of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plastic macro @-@ cent@@ ric ( C@@ max ) and the area below the conc@@ entri@@ c time curve ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) are generally in the total dosage range from 0.3 90 μ / kg at healthy and cancer patients dos@@ is@@ proportional .
&quot; according to intraven@@ ous gift from Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0,25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , which was reduced by 11 Ho@@ den@@ kar@@ zin@@ om@@ pati@@ os between day 1 and day 5 gem@@ s mean ( ± SD ) rise of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron @-@ Plas@@ mak@@ on@@ cent@@ ation at 42 ± 34 % . &quot;
&quot; from pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simul@@ ations , that at once daily intraven@@ ous gift from 0,25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron had been comparable to 3 consecutive days ( AU@@ C0@@ - ∞ ) with which after recur@@ rent intraven@@ ous administration of 0,75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ max after the one @-@ off of 0,75 mg was higher . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % will be eliminated by the kid@@ neys , and some more 50 % are converted into two primary met@@ abol@@ ish , which have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 recept@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vit@@ ro studies to Met@@ abol@@ isation have shown that CY@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in a reduced dimensions , the I@@ so@@ re@@ me CY@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and CY@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 at the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron are involved . &quot;
&quot; Eli@@ mination After a intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were recovered about 80 % of the dose within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ change@@ able ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; according to a unique intraven@@ ous remedy for healthy , the total body of 173 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al Clear@@ ance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although in patients with severe liver stri@@ ving the termin@@ ale Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time , and the average systematic exposure to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron increases , however , reducing the dose is therefore non @-@ justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were observed only after Ex@@ positions , which are considered enough about the maximum human therapeutic exposure , which indicates a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 from pre@@ clinical trials are evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block in very high concentr@@ ations of I@@ onic channels that are involved in the v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ pot and rep@@ lic@@ isation and can extend the action time .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose has been given in about the 30@@ times of the therapeutic exposure to people ) who have been given daily over two years , led to a multip@@ lied frequency of liver enzy@@ mes , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ atic , auto@@ glob@@ es , but not with mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not entirely known , but due to the used high doses and since Alo@@ xi determines the unique application , the relevance of these results will be small . &quot;
the owner of this approval for the in@@ coming must inform the European Commission on the plans for the transport within the framework of this decision .

&quot; June 2006 , the Committee for Human@@ itarian products ( CH@@ MP ) passed a negative value , in which the permission for the approval of hepatitis C intended for the treatment of hepatitis C , with Alph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml inj@@ ecting resolution has been recommended . &quot;
this means the Alph@@ eon of a biological medicine named Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same phar@@ ma @-@ efficient active component should be approved already in the EU ( also &quot; Reference phar@@ c@@ ision &quot; ) .
Alph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( long @-@ standing ) hepatitis C ( one with a viral detection ) .

&quot; it is produced by a yeast into which a gene has been introduced ( DNA ) , which is stimul@@ ated to the formation of the active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Alph@@ eon presented data from the comparison of Alph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active structure , composition and purity of the medication by means of drug , safety and effectiveness in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of patients with hepatitis C , the effectiveness of Alph@@ eon has been compared with the effectiveness of the reference quart@@ z with 455 patients . &quot;
&quot; the study was measured , how many patients after 12 of 48 treatment weeks as well as 6 months after setting the treatment appeared to the drug ( i.e. no sign of the virus in the blood ) . &quot;

&quot; the number of patients with hepatitis C , which spoke to treatment with Alph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A , was similar in clinical study . &quot;
after setting the treatment with al@@ eon sp@@ amm@@ ates the disease in more patients than with the reference quart@@ z ; moreover Alph@@ eon had more side effects .
&quot; apart from that , in the study conducted a test for exam@@ ining the question , to what extent the drug forms an immune response ( i.e. the body forms si@@ RNA - special proteins - against the drug ) , not sufficient vali@@ dated . &quot;

Al@@ tar@@ go is not to be used to treat infections that were im@@ printed or presum@@ ably caused by meth@@ ic@@ e@@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go against this kind of infections may not affect this kind of infections .
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under the age of 18 may no more than 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient spoke after two to three days , the doctor should examine the patients again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial reefs ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and inhi@@ bit the growth of bacteria .
the main indi@@ cul@@ ator of the efficacy was published in all five studies of the proportion of patients whose infection was cancelled after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.6 % ) of 139 patients suffering from Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.8 % ) of 71 patients under plac@@ ebo on treatment .
&quot; during the treatment of infected cars , Al@@ tar@@ go and Cef@@ al@@ exin showed similar contact : if the results of both studies were combined with Hau@@ ges , spoke about 90 % of the patients of both groups on the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , however , that Al@@ tar@@ go was found in the treatment of ab@@ rup@@ t@@ ets ( eit@@ ed hol@@ low spaces in the body tissues ) or of infections that have been im@@ printed or presum@@ ably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side @-@ effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the customer place .
&quot; the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran out to conclude that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in the spa treatment of the following super@@ ficial skin infections towards the risks over@@ lap : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • in@@ duced little Laz@@ y , ab@@ di@@ ced or genital wo@@ unds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go in the entire European Union . &quot;
patients in which there are no improvement within two or three days are to be investigated once and be considered an alternative therapy . ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation through the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be , the treatment is dis@@ car@@ ded , the sal@@ ary carefully dis@@ regard and an appropriate alternative therapy of the infection can be started . &quot;
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) .
in clinical trials at secondary wo@@ unds was the effectiveness of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections that were caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant St@@ aphy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) .
&quot; an alternative therapy is to be considered , if after an 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs . &quot;
the effect of simultaneous application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other top@@ ical means on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other top@@ ical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the small plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations , which were reached in humans after top@@ ical application at the di@@ ced skin or infected super@@ ficial wo@@ unds , is a clin@@ ically relevant inhibit@@ or in vi@@ vo not to be expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;

animal studies have shown a re@@ produ@@ tion@@ sto@@ x@@ icity after oral intake and are inadequate with regard to a statement on the birth and the fat / post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should be used during pregnancy when an top@@ ical anti @-@ bacterial therapy is clearly indic@@ ative and the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the gift of a system@@ ic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether the breast@@ feeding continues , or the therapy with Al@@ tar@@ go continues to be finished , is between the benefit of the breast@@ feeding for the inf@@ ant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials to 2@@ 150 patients with super@@ ficial skin infections , which have applied Al@@ tar@@ go , was the most commonly reported by side @-@ effect Ir@@ rit@@ ation at the meeting place , which affects approximately 1 % of the patients . &quot;

the function mechanism of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective inhi@@ ation of the bacterial proteins of the 50@@ s sub@@ unit of the bacter@@ i@@ al Ri@@ bos@@ oms which differs from the ties of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti @-@ bacterial substances .
data point out that the Bin@@ ding _ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 are involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ t@@ estation and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ as@@ e@@ center .

&quot; should , due to the local prevalence of resistance to the application of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin , at least some infectious forms , should be as@@ cert@@ ained by experts . &quot;
&quot; there were no differences in In @-@ vit@@ ro activity of ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , regardless of whether the isol@@ ate sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in were . &quot;
&quot; in case of non @-@ speaking , the presence of tribes with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us should be considered the presence of tribes with additional viral factors ( such as PV@@ L = Pant@@ on @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( diseases that concern the liver ) in children between one and 15 years which are not im@@ mu@@ n against these two diseases .
Ambi@@ rix is applied as part of a two doses of existing vaccines when a protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after administration of the second dose .
&quot; for this reason Ambi@@ rix may only be used when immun@@ isation is a low risk of hepatitis B infection and is ensured that the two doses can be led up to the end of two doses . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose of hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or other hepatitis can be given . &quot;
&quot; vaccines work by putting the immune system ( the natural def@@ ender of the body ) , &quot; as it can be against a disease . &quot;
&quot; once a child has received the vaccine , the immune system recognis@@ es the viruses and surface of anti@@ gens as &quot; foreign &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix contains the same ingredients as since 1996 the approved vaccine Twin@@ rix adults and who has been approved for 1997 Twin@@ rix children since 1997 .
&quot; the three vaccines are applied to protection against the same diseases , however , Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children under one of three doses are administ@@ ered to existing vaccines . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults include identical ingredients , some of the data used by Twin@@ rix Ad@@ ults , also used as proof for the use of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indi@@ c@@ ator for the effectiveness was the percentage of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a month after the last injection of antibodies .
&quot; in an additional study with 208 children , the effectiveness of the vaccine is compared with a six months and a 12 @-@ month distance between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix resulted in between 98 and 100 % of the vacc@@ inated children one month after the last injection of antibodies against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of protection of Ambi@@ rix was similar to six @-@ month intervals between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed at more than 1 of 10 vaccines ) are head@@ ache , appeti@@ peti@@ tions , pain at the inj@@ ecting , redness , mat@@ ity ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may occur in patients suffering from other components or Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) to be applied .
August 2002 the European Commission shared the company G@@ lax@@ o@@ Smith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ olog@@ icals s.@@ a. a permit for the in@@ scription of Ambi@@ rix in the entire
&quot; the standardization plan for the Grun@@ di@@ mm@@ un@@ ization with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ inations , whereby the first dose is administ@@ ered at the date of choice and the second dose between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her place both for hepatitis A and hepatitis B is required , can be vacc@@ inated with the corresponding mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ants vaccines or with a combination of material . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ B@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis B virus ( anti @-@ H@@ AV ) antibodies are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ der vaccines .
&quot; it is not yet completely secured whether immun@@ o competent person , which may be addressed to an hepatitis A@@ - vaccine , as they may also be protected by immun@@ ologic antibodies as well as protection against immun@@ ologic memory . &quot;
&quot; 3 As with all inj@@ ections , for the rare case of an an@@ aphy@@ si@@ cal reaction after the Gift of the vaccine for the appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring are always available immediately . &quot;
&quot; if a fast protection against hepatitis B is required , the Stand@@ ardi@@ mp@@ f@@ sch@@ ema is recommended with the com@@ promising simple , the 360 ELISA units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface surface . &quot;
&quot; in Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis and individuals with mal@@ functions of the immune system , under certain circumstances , the anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies is achieved so that in these cases the gift of further vaccines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since an in@@ tra@@ der@@ mal inj@@ ecting or in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a subtle impact success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix may be sub@@ stan@@ tive as sub@@ cut@@ aneous in these cases , since it can occur in these cases to in@@ tram@@ us@@ cular gift . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administ@@ ered in the form of a separate injection , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , az@@ ell@@ ular pol@@ ymers , in@@ activation type b vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cot vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with a combined mas@@ cot vaccine ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune def@@ ective , it may not be assumed that there may be no adequate immune response . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , which was kidn@@ apped with 3 vacc@@ inations of this formulation , was the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ iness , Gast@@ ro@@ enter@@ i@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever comparable to the frequency that has been observed in the earlier lo@@ om@@ ers@@ al@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine . &quot;
&quot; in clinical studies , 2029 vacc@@ d@@ ants Ambi@@ rix were administ@@ ered in a total of 10@@ 27 vaccine at the age of 1 to including 15 years . &quot;
in a study with 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years the compatibility of Ambi@@ rix has been compared with the 3 @-@ cans combination menu .
&quot; only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and sailors on a comp@@ uted base per vaccine d@@ osis Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the gift of Ambi@@ rix at 5@@ 0,@@ 7 % of prob@@ es compared to 39.@@ 1 % in the proportions of a dose of 3 @-@ cans combination simple .
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination reported 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the promot@@ er , the Ambi@@ rix had given enough about pain , compared to 6@@ 3,@@ 8 % for the promot@@ ers that have been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ Dos@@ - combination material . &quot;
&quot; however , the incidence of sailors was comparable ( i.e. about the entire vacc@@ ination of 39.@@ 6 % of the promot@@ er , the Ambi@@ rix had compared with 36.@@ 2 % for the promot@@ ers , which received the 3 @-@ cans combination menu ) . &quot;
the incidence pronounced pain and soft@@ ness was low and comparable to that has been observed after administration of the combination that has been observed with the 3 @-@ cans vaccine .
in a compar@@ ative study at 1@@ - to 11 @-@ year Imp@@ fl@@ ingen was the appearance of local reactions and gener@@ alization actions in the ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group with the 3 @-@ cans combination simple hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ able hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ surface @-@ surface @-@ surface @-@ surface @-@ surface .
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11@@ pm , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix had a common appearance of pain ( on inj@@ ecting ) per dose , not per pro@@ band . &quot;
the share of vacc@@ inations that schem@@ as with Ambi@@ rix or during the 3 @-@ cans of schem@@ as with a combination of 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units form@@ al@@ in@@ activated hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B ) was statisti@@ cally not different .
&quot; in clinical studies , which were carried out at Imp@@ fl@@ ingen at the age of 1 to including 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ al rates for anti @-@ H@@ AV 99@@ ,@@ 1 % one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 odi@@ zed dose ( d. h. in month 7 ) . &quot;
the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ rates for anti @-@ h@@ bs were 7@@ 4.7 % a month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second , to the month 6 ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a compar@@ ative study , which was carried out at 12@@ pm , including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination simple with three doses . &quot;
&quot; for the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ eit@@ y were able , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in the month 2 and 6 according to a hub of the 3 @-@ dosage is significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; the immune response , which were obtained in a clinical comparison study at 1@@ - until 11 @-@ year @-@ olds a month after ending the full vaccine series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
in both studies the Imp@@ fl@@ inge either received a 2 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ cans vacc@@ ination with a combination of 360 ELISA units form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis @-@ A @-@ Virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface .
&quot; for individuals who were at the time of pri@@ di@@ mm@@ ation between 12 and 15 years old , the Per@@ sist@@ ence of Anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies have been proven for at least 24 months after the immun@@ isation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vaccines . &quot;
the immune response in this study involving both anti@@ gens was comparable to the vaccine based on vacc@@ ination from 3 cans with a combination simp@@ atic material consisting of 360 ELISA units formal Hep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A @-@ Virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface in a dosage volume of 0.5 ml .
in a clinical trial at 12@@ - including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds could be shown that the Per@@ sist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ h@@ bs antibodies in 0 @-@ 6@@ - months @-@ vacc@@ ination is comparable to that in 0 @-@ 12 @-@ months @-@ vaccines .
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix were at the same time with the refres@@ her value of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ ic , Tet@@ an@@ us@@ - , in@@ activation type b @-@ vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mask vaccine ( D@@ TP@@ a @-@ IP@@ V / Hi@@ b ) or with the first dose of a combined mas@@ cot vaccine administ@@ ered , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
&quot; clinical study conducted with 3 doses of current formulation in adults , showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ective and Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sion@@ ry as for the earlier formulation . &quot;
the vaccine is both before and after the Res@@ us@@ tion as well as to investigate any eyel@@ et on any foreign @-@ particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; hepatitis A @-@ virus is usually transmitted by viral food and drinks , but can also be transmitted by other ways , such as through Baden in through dra@@ inage poll@@ uted waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a bl@@ iss@@ ful face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( yellow search ) and other symptoms that may possibly make a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vaccines , Ambi@@ rix may not fully protect against infection with hepatitis or hepatitis B virus while the complete vaccines have been completed with 2 cans . &quot;
if you are infected / your child before the administration of both vaccines have already infected with hepatitis A@@ - or hepatitis B virus / is ( although you / your child does not feel uncomfortable or ill / feels ) can prevent a vaccine may possibly not prevent .
&quot; protection against other infections that cause the liver as@@ ham@@ ed or symptoms which are similar to an hepatitis or hepatitis B infection can not be convey@@ ed . &quot;
• if you already have an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine including ne@@ omy@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) .
an allergic reaction can express themselves by ju@@ ck@@ elling rash , respir@@ ation or swelling of the face or tongue . • if you have already performed an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B. • if you have a serious infection with fever . &quot;
&quot; • if you want to have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and before the usually planned administration of the second vacc@@ in@@ osis ) . &quot;
&quot; with a possible risk of infection with hepatitis B between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from a vaccine with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead he will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of an combined Hepatitis A@@ - / hepatitis B vaccine with a decreased content of effective components per vaccine d@@ osis ( 360 ELISA units of a formal hepatitis B @-@ A @-@ Virus ) and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B @-@ surface areas ) .
the second vacc@@ ination of this vaccine with decreased content for effective components is usually administ@@ ered a month after the first dose and is likely to give you a vaccine protection from ter@@ mination of the vaccine .
&quot; sometimes Ambi@@ rix may suffer from people who suffer from severe blood pressure disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • if you / your child is weak@@ ened due to a disorder or treatment in your / her body @-@ defense / or if you / your child can move to a her@@ d@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix may be given in these cases but the immune response of these persons on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strong the reaction to vacc@@ ination is .
21 Are you taking your doctor if you can take other medicines / one ( including those who have been administ@@ ered without a prescription ) or if you have been administ@@ ered / your child recently / has been administ@@ ered or Imm@@ ung@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins ( si@@ RNA ) or if you have planned this in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine must be given simultaneously with Ambi@@ rix , should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as possible to the different limb@@ s . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix should be administ@@ ered at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ og@@ lo@@ bul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine nonetheless will be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; usually Ambi@@ rix pregnant or nursing women is not administ@@ ered , except it is urgently needed that they are vacc@@ inated both against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B. &quot;
important information on certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please inform your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ omy@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the agreed appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , speak to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; highly frequent ( more than 1 case per 10 decre@@ asing cans ) : • pain , or discomfort at the inser@@ tion or redness • soft@@ ness • ri@@ ck@@ ability • head@@ aches • Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ man@@ gel &quot;

&quot; on the basis of the data , which have become known since the division of the first approval for the in@@ scription , the CH@@ MP opinion that the benefit @-@ risk @-@ ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , Ambi@@ rix had been brought into traffic only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to low patient exposure . &quot;

&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps is divided - split up to several single @-@ p@@ ants to meals - sw@@ allowed , mixed under the food or via a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ iter ( by the stomach in the stomach of leading hose ) or an nas@@ al son@@ de ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a compar@@ ative study , since Am@@ mon@@ aps are not associated with any other treatment or with plac@@ ebo ( a spot@@ light medicine , i.e. without any active ingredient ) . &quot;
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps may also lead to Ap@@ peti@@ t@@ loss , an ab@@ norm@@ ality inf@@ ants in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , hydr@@ ation , hydr@@ ation , nau@@ sea , v@@ om@@ iting , irrit@@ ation , rash , in@@ pleas@@ ing body fat or weight increase . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran to the conclusion that Am@@ mon@@ aps are effective in patients with disorders of the ur@@ inary cycle to high ammon@@ ium values .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ aps was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , because due to the rar@@ ity of the disease at the time of authorisation is limited to this medicine . &quot;
&quot; the use is indic@@ ted in all patients , where a complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ gel organ already manifes@@ ts in the new@@ born age ( within the first 28 days of life ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ stable form ( in@@ complete En@@ z@@ ym@@ def@@ ective , which is manifest@@ ed after the first life of life ) there is an indication of the use when in the an@@ am@@ n@@ ese is a hyper@@ ammon@@ ite En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy . &quot;
&quot; for inf@@ ants , for children who are not able to sw@@ allow tablets or for patients with sl@@ it@@ ches , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ules . &quot;
the daily dose is individually calculated in taking into account the protein intoler@@ ance and the patient &apos;s development and the development of the daily protein intake of the patient .
&quot; according to recent clinical experience , the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg , as well as in urban @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from a pre @-@ manipul@@ ated lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ates or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ia , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
patients with an Ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency need argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS tablets may not be administ@@ ered patients with sle@@ eves , as a risk for the emergence of Ö@@ soph@@ ag@@ us@@ ul@@ zer@@ a , if the tablets cannot immediately reach the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2,@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which is the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should therefore be used in patients with con@@ sti@@ pulation of heart @-@ suff@@ iciency or severe kidney disease , as well as with so@@ dium re@@ ten@@ tion and econom@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ isation and ex@@ cre@@ tion of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at about the liver and the kid@@ neys , AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS should be used in patients with Leb@@ er- or kidney in@@ suff@@ iciency only with extreme caution . &quot;
the meaning of these results concerning pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore con@@ trained ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; at sub@@ k@@ ut@@ aner gift of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 474 mg / kg ) , it came to a slo@@ wing of the neur@@ onal multip@@ lication and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; it also found a dev@@ out matur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses , and a dimin@@ ished number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth . &quot;
&quot; it could not be determined whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is left at the mother &apos;s breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS , at 56 % of patients stood at least one unwanted event ( AE ) at least one unwanted event ( AE ) and at 78 % of this undes@@ irable events that they did not associate with AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( &gt; 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 years old ab@@ norm@@ ative patient , that has developed a metabo@@ lic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ th@@ a@@ emia , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ erer neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose entered with a 5 month old babies with a vers@@ ed single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms go with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed up to 400 mg / kg / day an dos@@ is@@ limit neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ icity .
Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a metabo@@ lic active connection that is controlled by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ yl@@ ated con@@ ju@@ ate that will be depos@@ ited over the kid@@ neys .
&quot; sticks , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative support for ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus nit@@ rogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ cycle can be accepted that for each gram to produce so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ rogen .
it is of importance that diagnosis is early and treatment immediately is started to improve the survival chances and clinical result .
the progn@@ osis of the early manipul@@ ated form of the disease with appearance of the first symptoms in the new@@ born age was formerly almost always inf@@ ist and the disease led even during treatment with Per@@ it@@ one@@ al@@ di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their sti@@ cking @-@ free an@@ alogue within the first life year to death .
&quot; by Hä@@ modi@@ aly@@ sis , the util@@ isation of alternative ways of nit@@ rogen ( so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , so@@ dium ben@@ zo@@ at and Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , so@@ dium ben@@ ding and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to diagnose the survival rate of new@@ born in post@@ part@@ al ( however within the first life of life ) diagnosed diseases to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease has been diagnosed in the course of pregnancy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even with these patients it came with time for many mental disabilities or other neurological defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ stable form of the disease ( including female patients with the heter@@ ozy@@ g@@ ated form of the Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ian @-@ deficiency ) , treated with so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and a prot@@ ested diet , was the survival rate of 98 % . &quot;
already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible in treatment and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological state .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ox@@ idi@@ zed , which is produced in liver and kidney enz@@ ym@@ atic with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ated glut@@ amine is created . &quot;
&quot; the concentr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and his Met@@ abol@@ ites in Plas@@ ma and Ur@@ in were obtained according to the gift of a single dose of 5 g of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ ated and with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis of tr@@ al doses of up to 20 g / day ( not controlled studies ) . &quot;
the behavior of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at and its met@@ abol@@ ism was also examined in cancer victims according to intraven@@ ous gases of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
after a or@@ tal single dose of 5 g of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in tablet form were found 15 minutes after the intake measurable plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ l@@ ati@@ cycli@@ c goods or hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , according to different doses phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) the next morning after the next morning , no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate at the plas@@ ma bar . &quot;
&quot; with three of six patients with liver cir@@ rh@@ osis , which were repeated with Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at ( 20 g / day oral in three single retailers ) , the middle phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plas@@ mas@@ on the third day five times higher than according to the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The drug is retired in 24 hours to approximately 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gi@@ ated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ amine over the kid@@ neys .
according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us testing had so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at with toxic and non toxic doses ( investigation 24 and 48 h after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) .
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS gran@@ ules is taken either oral ( inf@@ ants and children , who can not sw@@ allow any tablets , or patients with fl@@ ot@@ ches ) or over a Gast@@ ro@@ stom@@ i@@ esch@@ l@@ .@@ also or an nas@@ al son@@ de . &quot;
&quot; according to recent clinical experience the normal daily dose of Nat@@ ri@@ um@@ phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day with children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in urban @-@ growing and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammonia , argin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( in particular bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , Car@@ ni@@ tin and Ser@@ um@@ prot@@ a in the plas@@ ma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
&quot; in patients who suffer from a pre @-@ manipul@@ ated lack of car@@ bam@@ yl@@ phosph@@ ates or Or@@ ni@@ thin@@ tran@@ scar@@ path@@ ia , is the sub@@ stitution of Cit@@ rul@@ lin or argin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3,@@ 8 g / m ² / day required . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS Gran@@ ule contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per gram of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) so@@ dium per 20 g so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at , which is the maximum daily dose . &quot;

&quot; a prob@@ able toxic response to AM@@ MON@@ A@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 years old ab@@ norm@@ ative patient , that has developed a metabo@@ lic En@@ cep@@ hal@@ opathy in conjunction with Lak@@ tat@@ th@@ a@@ emia , Panz@@ yt@@ open@@ ia , periph@@ erer neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; sticks , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable ( both compounds contain 2 nit@@ rogen at@@ oms ) ; Phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative support to the ex@@ cre@@ tion of surplus value . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of studies on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ yl@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ tic cycle may be accepted that for each gram , so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at between 0.12 and 0,@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ ates are produced . &quot;
&quot; already existing neurological defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and in some patients may occur a further deterioration of the neurological state . &quot;
after a or@@ tal single dose of 5 g of so@@ dium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at in gran@@ ul@@ at@@ form were found 15 minutes after taking measurable plas@@ ma @-@ centr@@ ations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ yr@@ at .

&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox is used for the treatment of adult patients with &quot; acute Cor@@ on@@ ar@@ mo@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( ACS , decreased blood sugar to the heart ) , for example , at inst@@ abil@@ er Ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ din@@ ous ( cardi@@ ac ) without &quot; &quot; ST@@ - Heb@@ ung &quot; &quot; ( a decent measurement value in the electric di@@ og@@ ram or E@@ KG ) . &quot;
&quot; if an@@ gi@@ ox is applied to prevent blood cl@@ auses in patients suffering from a PCI slot , a higher dose is administ@@ ered and the inf@@ usion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help in patients with anxiety or heart attack to maintain blood flow and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; about 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of ACS , in which the effect of angi@@ ox at all@@ some gift or in connection with a Gl@@ y@@ kop@@ rot@@ ein @-@ II@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug treatment with Hep@@ arin ( another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ) and a G@@ PI was compared . &quot;
&quot; during PCI the patient is often a st@@ ent ( a short tube which remains in the arter@@ ies to prevent a closure ) , and they received additionally other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ auses , such as Ab@@ ci@@ xim@@ ab , and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of ACS , An@@ gi@@ ox - with or without a gift of G@@ PI - in preventing new events ( deaths , cardi@@ ac or aud@@ ul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year are as effective as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients who moved to a PCI war , An@@ gi@@ ox has just as effective as Hep@@ arin , except in severe ble@@ eding , where it was clearly more effective than Hep@@ arin . &quot;
An@@ gi@@ ox may not be used in patients that may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) against Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , other her@@ ud@@ ins or any other components . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in patients which had recently been a ble@@ eding , as well as with people with strong hyper@@ tension or serious kidney problems or a cardi@@ ac disease . &quot;
the Committee on Human@@ phar@@ ma ( CH@@ MP ) ran out to conclude that An@@ gi@@ ox in the treatment of ACS and during a PCI a acceptable replacement for Hep@@ arin is .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared the Company The Medi@@ c@@ ines Company UK Ltd as a licence for the transport of an@@ gi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute Kor@@ on@@ ar@@ syn@@ dro@@ mes ( inst@@ ab@@ ile Ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST @-@ le@@ vers ) for an emergency relief or when an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initi@@ al@@ d@@ osis of angi@@ ox in patients with ACS is a intraven@@ ous bolt of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an inf@@ usion of 0.25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if in case of the patient is performed a PCI , an additional bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be given and inf@@ usion for the duration of intervention to 1,75 mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;
&quot; after PCI may be taken to clinical requirements , the reduced inf@@ usion dose of 0,25 mg / kg / h for 4 to 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a bolt of 0,5 mg / kg should be administ@@ ered , followed by an inf@@ usion of 1,75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the surgery . &quot;
the recommended dosage of an@@ gi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of a initi@@ als of 0,75 mg / kg body weight and one of them directly following intraven@@ ous inf@@ usion with a dose of 1,75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the intervention .
the safety and effectiveness of a single bolt @-@ gift of An@@ gi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI procedure is planned .
&quot; this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shor@@ tened to under 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg / body weight should be done . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the appearance lower ACT values , the re@@ constitu@@ ent and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis must be administ@@ ered quickly intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; once the ACT amounts to more than 225 seconds , another surveillance is no longer required , provided the 1,75 mg / kg inf@@ usion dose is properly administ@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney functionality ( G@@ FR 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which treated a PCI ( whether with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in against ACS or not ) , should be used a lower inf@@ usion rate of 1.9 mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; is the ACT value among 225 seconds , is a second Bol@@ us@@ d@@ osis of 0.@@ 3 mg / kg to be administ@@ ered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second leg dose . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which resulted in phase II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( Re@@ place @-@ 2 ) which resulted in approval was the ACT worth 5 minutes by the Gift of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Bol@@ us without Dos@@ is@@ customiz@@ able at an average 36@@ 6 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( G@@ FR &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also for di@@ aly@@ sis patients ( see under Section 4.3 ) .
the treatment of angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after ending the intraven@@ ous gift of un@@ fr@@ aud@@ ited Hep@@ arin or 8 hours following the completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous Gift of Dutch Hep@@ arin .

patients have been monitored during treatment carefully in terms of symptoms and signs of a ble@@ eding especially when Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ is administ@@ ered into combination with another anti @-@ ag@@ ul@@ ans ( see Section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in PCI patients suffering from Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in most ble@@ eding may occur at arter@@ ial points , can occur in patients suffering from a per@@ k@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ar@@ ism ( PCI ) during the treatment in principle everywhere ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , should be considered a monitoring of the IN@@ R Wer@@ ts ( International normal Rati@@ o ) to ensure that the value after lowering the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ der once again achieved the level of treatment . &quot;
&quot; starting from the knowledge of the hosts mechanism of anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants ( Hep@@ arin , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tika or Th@@ ro@@ ism aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) can be assumed that these active ingredients increase the ble@@ eding . &quot;
in combination of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in with Th@@ ro@@ ism aggreg@@ ates or anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ants are the clinical and biological hem@@ ost@@ al parameters in each case regularly control .
&quot; the animal experimental investigations are related to effects on pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , which is inadequate or the post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see under Section 5.3 ) . &quot;

&quot; both in the Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group as well as with Hep@@ arin , it came to women and patients over 65 years more frequently to unwanted events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
heavy ble@@ eding were defined according to the AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i &apos;s standards for heavy ble@@ eding as in the foot@@ steps of table 2 .
both light and heavy ble@@ eding occurred less frequently than in the groups with Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .

the following information about side effects are based on the data of a clinical trial with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at 6000 patients who moved to a PCI .
&quot; both in the bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in group and in accordance with Hep@@ arin , it came to women as well as in patients over 65 years more frequently to unwanted events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and heavy ble@@ eding stood under Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in significant less frequently than in the compar@@ ative group at Hep@@ arin plus G@@ PI@@ I@@ b / II@@ IA @-@ In@@ hi@@ bit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects which are not listed above , were reported according to comprehensive application in practice and are arranged according to System@@ atic classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ der is to be removed immediately and the patient can be monitored with regard to signs of a ble@@ eding . &quot;
&quot; An@@ gi@@ ox contains Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , a direct and specific thread inhibit@@ or , which is tied at the cat@@ aly@@ tic centre as well as at the anim@@ al@@ bin@@ der region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is tied in the liquid phase or at Ger@@ inn@@ sel . &quot;
&quot; the Bin@@ ding of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in at Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and thus its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in turn the ties of Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in @-@ Arg@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 slowly spl@@ its , thus reducing the function of the active center of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates . &quot;
&quot; in addition , by Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in , with Ser@@ um of patients , in which it has come to hep@@ at@@ in@@ duced Th@@ ro@@ ism / hep@@ ar@@ in@@ duced Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ osis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) , in@@ duced by t@@ mbo@@ cy@@ tes @-@ Ag@@ greg@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in case of healthy proportions and in patients Bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in has demonstrated a dos@@ is@@ - and con@@ centr@@ alised dependen@@ cy effect that will be occupied by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI has been performed in the patient , an additional bolt of 0.@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ val@@ ir@@ ud@@ in was given and the inf@@ usion for the duration of intervention to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h will be increased . &quot;

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used to treat adults , adolescents and children from six years of age with diabetes which need a treatment with ins@@ ulin . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the wall wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm inj@@ ected or as a continuous inf@@ usion with an ins@@ ulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough ins@@ ulin to control the gl@@ uc@@ ose veins or the ins@@ ulin is not effective .
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in distingu@@ ishes itself very slightly of human@@ ins@@ ulin and the change means that it has done faster and a shorter active ingredient than a short @-@ effective human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was used in combination with an effective ins@@ ulin in patients with type @-@ 1 diabetes , where the body cannot produce ins@@ ulin , in two studies with a total of 1 549 adults and in a study with 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; with type @-@ 2 diabetes , in which the body ins@@ ulin is not effective , A@@ pi@@ dra was examined in a study with 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
&quot; the main indi@@ g@@ ator for the effectiveness was the change of concentration of substance gly@@ cos@@ y@@ li@@ zed hem@@ og@@ lo@@ bin ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood , which shows how good the blood sugar is adjusted . &quot;
in the first study with adult type 1 diabetes after six months a reduction of 0.3 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % at In@@ sul@@ in@@ l@@ is@@ per .
in adults with type @-@ 2 diabetes the reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c @-@ concentration 5 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0,30 % of human normal ins@@ ulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients suffering from ins@@ ulin ( allergic ) against ins@@ ulin , or any other components , or in patients who already suffer from a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia . &quot;
the cans of A@@ pi@@ dra must be adapted if it is administ@@ ered along with a number of other medicines that can affect the blood @-@ glu@@ cos@@ al level .
&quot; September 2004 , the European Commission shared the San@@ o@@ fi @-@ Av@@ entis Germany GmbH to permit the approval of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
A@@ pi@@ dra is to use as sub@@ cut@@ aneous inj@@ ecting either in the area of the abdom@@ inal l@@ oth or of the del@@ ine or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous inf@@ usion in the area of the abdom@@ inal cord .
&quot; due to the reduced gl@@ uc@@ ose capacity and the dimin@@ ishing ins@@ ulin delivery , the ins@@ ulin needs to be reduced in patients with a restriction of liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of the active strength , the brand ( Her@@ - performer ) , of the ins@@ ulin delivery ( normal , N@@ PH , galvan@@ ized , etc . ) , the type of ins@@ ulin ( animal ins@@ ulin ) and / or the manufacturer method can draw a change in the ins@@ ulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 A inadequate dosage or the break@@ age of a treatment , especially in patients with a ins@@ inn@@ ate diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and a di@@ ab@@ etic K@@ eto@@ azi@@ ebox ; these conditions are potentially vital @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient at another ins@@ ulin type or ins@@ ulin of another manufacturer should take place under strict physician supervision and may make a change of dosage required .
the time of cess@@ ation of a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the efficacy of the In@@ sul@@ ine &apos;s active profile and can therefore change in the conversion of the treatment code .
&quot; to the substances which can increase blood sugar levels and increase the incl@@ ination to Hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics , Dis@@ op@@ pyram@@ ide , Fi@@ br@@ ate , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , mon@@ o@@ amine Ox@@ id@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) -@@ Hem@@ mer , Pent@@ ox@@ i@@ f@@ yll@@ in , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ pha , S@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the effect of Symp@@ ath@@ oly@@ tika like Bet@@ ab@@ lock@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ id@@ ine , gu@@ id@@ ine and reserves pin the symptoms of the ep@@ onymous counter @-@ regulation should be pun@@ ched or missing . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies at Re@@ production capacity , showed no differences between In@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and Human@@ ins@@ ulin in terms of pregnancy , the embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine enters into the human mother &apos;s milk , but generally , ins@@ ulin does not enter into the mother &apos;s milk , nor will it be res@@ or@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; below are the clinical trials known from clinical trials , group@@ ed according to System@@ atic classes and sorted according to the frequency of their appearance ( very frequently : &gt; &gt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally : &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) ; not known ( frequency on the basis of if availability ) . &quot;
&quot; cold , cooling , cool and bl@@ asse skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual fatigue or weakness , confusion , concentration of concentration , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , refl@@ ect@@ edness , nau@@ sea and heart@@ beat . &quot;
Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ ph@@ ie Wir@@ d failed to continuously change the inj@@ ecting within the injection area continuously , can occur in a result of a Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the inj@@ ections . &quot;
serious hy@@ po@@ gly@@ cem@@ ics with consci@@ ous@@ nesses can be given by means of in@@ tra @-@ mus@@ cular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) that is given by an appropriate person or by intraven@@ ous gift of gl@@ uc@@ ose by a doctor .
&quot; after a gl@@ uc@@ tance , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to identify the Ur@@ - thing for the heavy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
ins@@ ulin lo@@ wers the blood sugar levels by the stimulation of the periph@@ eral gl@@ uc@@ ose ( in particular through sk@@ el@@ eton muscles and fat ) and by the inhi@@ bit of gl@@ uc@@ ose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that at sub@@ k@@ ut@@ aner Ga@@ el@@ be of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in the efficiency occurs faster and the active period is shorter than at hu@@ - man@@ em regul@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male people aged 21 to 50 years with type @-@ 1 diabetes , In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in in the therapeutic effect of 0.@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg or more a dis@@ proportion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ity effect , exactly like human@@ ins@@ ulin . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has twice as fast efficiency of a normal human ins@@ ulin and achiev@@ es the full glu@@ cos@@ ity effect about 2 hours earlier than human@@ ins@@ ulin .
&quot; from the data it was obvious that when an application of In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal is reached a comparable @-@ level of gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control , the 30 minutes before the meal is given . &quot;
&quot; was In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before meal , was a better counter @-@ di@@ ale control than with human@@ istic ins@@ ulin , which has been given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 15 minutes after the start of the meal is applied , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control as with human@@ istic ins@@ ulin , which is given to 2 Mi@@ xed nu@@ ances before the meal ( see picture 1 ) . &quot;
In@@ sul@@ ing@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at G@@ abe 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the start of meal in comparison to human@@ istic ins@@ ulin ( figure 1A ) before the start of the meal was given ( figure 1A ) in front of the meal ( figure 1A ) in front of a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) before a meal ( figure 1@@ B ) .
