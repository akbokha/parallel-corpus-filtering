<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg tablets, as 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of melting tablets (tablets, which dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to one (1 mg / ml) and as an injection-resolution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wiring thinking and Speaking, hallucinations (hearing or vision of things that are not present), distrust and insulates; • Bipolar-I disorder, a psychic disorder, where the patients were manic episodes (periods of abnormal skylight) alternately with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">"atherfy is used for the treatment of severe to heavy manic episodes, and to the prevention of manic episodes in patients who have addressed the drug in the past."</seg>
<seg id="7">Injection-solution is applied for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disorders when the oral intake of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution can be applied to one or the melting-coated tablets in patients where the loop of tablets are difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who are taking other medicines simultaneously, which are being built just like atrify, should be adjusted to the dose of bilify."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this affects the signal transmission between brain cells by" "neurotransmitter," i.e. chemical substances which allow the communication of nerve cells. "</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripibuzole probably appears above all as a "partite agate" for the receptors for the neurotransmitter Dopamin and 5-hydroxytryptamine (also serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazene like 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters appears to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder play a role, contributes Aripipezole to normalize the activity of the brain, causing psychotic or manic symptoms and it will be prevented."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Abilify's effectiveness to prevent the symptoms of symptoms, was investigated in three studies over up to one year."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the effectiveness of injecting solution was compared in two studies at 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which compared to increased unrest, compared to a period of two hours with a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify has been stabilised about twelve weeks at 347 patients with Haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of atherfy and placebo that have been stabilised at 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with bilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the effectiveness of bilify injecting solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, which suffered an increased unrest, with which by Lorazepam (another anti-psychotic) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in all studies, the change in the symptoms of patients using a standard skala for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who spoke to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the company also led to study studies by examining how the body converts the melting tablets, and the solution to Einresorbiert (expires)."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the two studies with the injecting solution showed patients, the Abilify in doses of 5,25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg received a significant increase in the symptoms increased unrest than the patients who received a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in applying for the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify is more effective than placebo in four of the five short-term studies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"atherfy also prevented up to 74 weeks of effective than placebo the revival of manic episodes in previously treated patients, and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Aromatic injections in 10- or 15-mg doses also decreased effective than placebo the symptoms increased unrest and were similar effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify (observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extracting (uncontrollable), decay, nausea (citation), saliva (cooling), redness and exhaustion (increased storage production), redness and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleeability) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee on Humanpharma (CHMP) ran out to conclude that the benefits of atherfy during the treatment of schizophrenia and medium-severe to severe manic episode in patients, which had mainly manic episodes, and with those the manic episodes on the treatment with Aripibole said, compared to the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"furthermore, the committee came to the result that the benefits of injecting intruce and behavioural disorders in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes at Bipolar-I disorder when a orale therapy is not suitable to overlap the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"June 2004, the European Commission shared the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. a licence for the inscription of bilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">ABILIFY is for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of the Bipolar I- disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients which had mainly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazene (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended dose for ABILIFY is 10 or 15 mg / day at a time dose of 15 mg / day daily independent of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in doses over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended dose for ABILIFY is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The effectiveness of ABILIFY in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients with 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"considering the larger sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initialdosis should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 pre-unit is set off from the combination of the combination therapy, the Aripibole dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see Section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the appearance of suicide behaviour belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases following the beginning or after changing an anti-psychological therapy, also in treatment with Aripibole (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder, no tax risk associated with Aripiprazene in comparison to other anti-psychotic disorder."</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular diseases (myocardinal veins, removal disorders), cerebrovascular diseases, hypovolaemia, treatment with blood pressure drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and maligne form)."</seg>

<seg id="39">"if in one with ABILIFY, patients treated signs and symptoms of a spätdyskinesia, should be considered to reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"when a patient develops signs and symptoms that have been put on a mns, or unclear fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotic medication, including ABILIFY, must be set."</seg>

<seg id="47">"a weight gain is generally observed at schizophrine patients and in patients with bipolar mania due to combi-steamer, the use of antipsychotic medication which is known as side-effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripibuzole on the central system, caution is advisable when Aripipeole is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective medicines, such as secoding (see section 4.8)."</seg>
